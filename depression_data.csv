0,"Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it","We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say ""PM me anytime"" in a casual social context.  

We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  

Our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.

*****

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them."
1,"Regular check-in post, with information about our rules and wikis","Welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the ""role model"" rule, but are permitted here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.

-----

Our subreddit rules are located in the sidebar (you can also always access them at https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/about/rules) - since all of them exist for important safety reasons, we ask everyone here to read and follow them. Please click 'report' on any harmful content you see here - we always want to know and deal as soon as we can.

We also have several wikis there for help with finding and giving support:

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression provides guidance about what is and isn't a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the ""depression"" label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/giving_help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance for learning what is -- and isn't -- usually helpful in giving peer support.

YSK that the types of rule violations that we most frequently see interfering with people getting safe and relevant support here are:

- People breaking the private contact rule. You should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here. See https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/private_contact

- ""I'm here to help"" posts. This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The ""giving help"" wiki explains more about this.

- Role modelling, i.e. ""achievement"" or ""advice"" posts. This is an expert-free zone -- that's what peer support means (rule 5). We know that ""internet culture"" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions. Nothing like that is ever acceptable here.

- Content that's more about 'making a statement' or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support (or, in a comment, giving it) (rules 1, 2 and 10).

- Off-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal losses. Grief, sadness, anger, and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses. The ""what is depression"" wiki has suggestions for other places to post about these issues, which are 100% valid and serious but inappropriate here."

3,This anhedonia is insane,"Life feels like a gum I've been chewing for hours. All the flavor is gone, my jaw is tired but for some reason I keep chewing."
4,Back to alcohol and weed. For good this time ,"I’ve decided, to hell with sobriety. Fuck trying to stay straight and arrow. Fuck trying to get ahead. There is no escaping this hamster wheel of hell for us single middle class folks. The housing market and cost of living have gone batshit crazy in my country. Every time I make gains financially, the goalposts move. No matter how hard I try, I can’t seem to win. Based on how things are going, housing costs are just going to continue to blow up in my area due to corporate greed and our incompetent leaders. I don’t want to date or be in a relationship, but the single life is just not manageable anymore (without at least one roommate) for average earners like me. I’m content with my own company but again, I can’t carry on this way financially. It’s just not feasible. I have no more work/life balance. I don’t want to live a life where I have to dedicate all of my time to work, yet never see any reward or benefit and never have time to do the things I love or spend time with loved ones. Renting is now extremely expensive where I live so that’s not even an option. All hope is lost and my dignity and self esteem have disintegrated. I’ve decided to quit working and spend all of my savings on alcohol and weed until my body finally gives out on me. I have about 3 years or more of savings to live off of. What was supposed to go towards a down payment will now be used to poison & kill me instead. This is me officially giving up. I’ve hit a new low and am too tired to continue fighting. "
5,I collapsed at home and realized I could die right now and no one would notice or care.,"I write a bit of what is going on here: https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/iJASPexvn9 

But to continue. I have a part time job. It's not much but bills are being paid. My family still won't speak to me. My friends are still mad at me. I have one friend I text but she lives in the UK and I am in the US.

My routine is to go to work, look for full-time work on my off time, get rejected for every application I send in, lay on the couch, be unable to sleep, then go back to work.

I haven't gotten more than 4 hours of sleep collectively all this week and I had been taking every shift offered to me. Weekdays, weekends, nights, mornings, hell I don't care. Give me the hours.

Then two days ago, I had felt awful all day. I was sore everywhere as if I had been beaten up. I have chronic pain but this was on *top*of that. I lost track of how much aspirin I took just to make it through my shifts. I haven't been able to buy food, so I had a soda that was offered to me at a job interview for dinner. My home is a gross mess, so I decided to start small and clean the living room. I was organizing papers when my head felt like concrete and I hit the coffee table and then the floor.

I woke up on the floor, a cut on my head, a bruise on my face. My heart was going so hard that I could hear it between my ears. When I finally got up, and checked my phone for the time, I saw I missed a group outing the night before, then a face time date with and old friend. I thought ""oh crap, I better let them know I am okay and apologize"" but then I noticed that no one had texted or called at all. It reminded me of the accident, of the moments when I lost my job, all the things and no one reached out or even...noticed...?

It's occurred to me that I have nothing and no one. If I had just had a heart attack or aneurysm or whatever and dropped forever, no one would notice or care. I would be found by the landlord or police after a bill wasn't paid or something. I don't matter. I would just be written off as just some hermit lost soul or whatever people think of me. My parents would likely be relieved and my siblings would just be please to use me as a hashtag for clout. It would be negotiating if I weren't too exhausted to be mad.

6,My parents are nice but they can be so unknowingly cruel,"They’re both christian catholic, doctors and such good family providers. They can give me stuff I want and bring me to trips which I’m thankful of.

But they hurt me sometimes without them even knowing:

1. I was very destructive in my childhood. Broke or misplaced my toys during kinder to early grade school. I don’t remember what I broke one time but I remember my mom saying something like, “This is why you don’t deserve nice things” or “This gift is wasted on you.” When I told her she said something like that to me, she says she doesn’t remember.

2. Bullied at grade school. They told me to ignore it and it didn’t go away. They didn’t take it seriously, my school guidance counselor didn’t take it seriously. Got depressed and went into self-harm. My parents eventually saw it, confronted me, cried and pleaded to me to not do it ever again bc it hurts them. Told me to pray. I didn’t like seeing them cry so I said ok. I didn’t get professional help at that time. Just tried to busy myself w/ anything which worked for a while but then…

3. Pandemic made my mental health worse so I did end up getting professional help online and took meds. Partly because my school just kept piling on requirements and deadlines. When I opened up to my dad about this, he told me that every student is facing the same thing. Ok then

4. Currently in med school and tbh I don’t even know if I want to be a doctor. I got into skincare bc I had bad acne (partly why I got bullied lol) and my parents constantly told me I should be a dermatologist. Got depressed again. I’m failing almost all my subjects (<75%) and I can’t even care. Don’t like the culture and most of the people here in school.

5. Opened up to my parents about having suicidal thoughts. That I’ll never ever do it but I think & research a lot about it and the best methods. My dad told me people who do that are selfish and if I do it, that means I don’t love them, I don’t love my family. Ok.

6. Recently just told my mom that I think I need to take antidepressants again. She told me to just keep drinking vitamins and true focus supplements instead. Oh and keep praying + studying. I don’t know if I want to laugh or cry.

Starting to make peace with the fact that they’ll never understand me. Which breaks my heart. Also that I never had the backbone to say no so there’s that.

They did tell me that they won’t think less of me if I don’t finish med school and that they’re proud of my achievements ♡"
7,I don’t want to live.,"I’m just a useless alcoholic who’s just wasted his parent’s money and is a nobody, just ruining myself and everyone around me. I’m not worth this life, I fuck myself up and then regret, sometimes can’t even take the slightest inconveniences. I don’t know what to do, I just want to give up, I love life but I don’t want to live like this."
8,I want to die ,Everyday when I wake up I wait till the last possible minute to wake up.  Now I am even late for work which means I need to stay longer which makes me hate my life even more because I have to work. I hate work. Everyday I wake up and tell myself I don’t wanna wake up. It’s terrible. My boyfriend tells me I should be grateful for my life. But it’s not that I am ungrateful. It is just a feeling I have of constant depression and constant disappointment and anxiety. I can’t see things positively. I try to trick myself into thinking less in extremes as my therapist told me. But it just doesn’t work. I am really considering just killing myself. But I’m probably such a coward to do it. I genuinely just wish I just wouldn’t wake up anymore. 
9,I WANT IT TO END,I DON’T WANT TO BE HERE ANYMORE
10,Why do I love so much?,Why can’t I get it through my stupid head when people don’t like or love me. People who don’t reciprocate the same love I give. I love and love and love no matter how the other person treats me. I just keep going. Even years after we stopped talking and blocked each other. Friends and family. I just can’t stop. I throw myself at everyone. I beg for love. I over share. I’m loud. I talk too much. Why can’t I just be quiet. Why can’t I just let things go. Why can’t I just leave. What is wrong with me. I wish I’d just grow up. I wish I’d listen instead of talk. I wish I’d just shut up. I wish I didn’t trust every person I meet. And forgive everyone for every last hurtful thing they do. I always forgive. No matter what. No matter how hurtful it was. Why can’t I just give up. What do I do. How do I just stop. I wish I wasn’t me. 
11,Just cut myself for the first time in years,"As the title says I just cut myself for the first time in years. The feeling of apathy that I've been feeling has of course boiled over and I took a slice for the first time in years. I'm so disappointed in myself, but I've been ignoring my feelings and shoving them down that it got too much.  I hate this low and right now I hate myself. I cant bring myself to bring it up to my friends but I needed to get it off my chest to other people that will understand the feeling of release. But not in a way of encouragement but in a way of understanding. It felt good in the moment but now I am just angry at myself for giving in after so many years. Ranting to the wind baby!"
12,im the most boring and ugliest person alive,"i dont give a fuck if pubery will hit me, i look like a fucking troll, im the most disgusting and ugliest girl alive, no makeup makes me beautiful and no amount of starving and excessive excersice work, im just bound to be alone and ugly i guess. Half the girls my age are so much more prettier and im just..me. Nothing special at all, just miserable and horrible and ugly. I’ve been 8 days clean, but i dont think i want to keep going nor will i. I dont care anymore."
13,I feel like God is punishing me,"I'm in stage of my life where any attempt of me doing something, it just goes wrong. It's non-stop. I got fired my job, I was in this 5 month hiring process only to get rejected. I tried to join the military as an officer but was turned away by the recruiter because I need to wait a year for the waiver bc of my ADHD. My dog unexpectedly died this past week. Today I just messed up a zoom call appointment for this program I applied to because I mistakenly booked it twice, and my camera wouldn't turn on. I was prepping for it so much. I try to see the positive. That the silver lining is that my relationship in God has grown stronger, but I feel so defeated.

Not to mention, all my relationships with friends just seem to go downhill."
14,I'm starting to think that only people with mental illnesses truly give a shit about the feelings of people they don't know,"I know this is an overstatement and I don't really think it applies as a rule to everyone. I've met some people who I don't believe have ever suffered from any mental health issue and yet are super caring and kind and understandind because that's just how they are. Yet the more I interact with people from all backgrounds the more I think that only those who know what it feels like to feel truly alone and hopeless know how to treat people with proper kindness, or at least in a way that doesn't include the other person leaving a conversation and feeling even more shitty and worthless.

I've been suffering from depression and suicidal thoughts ever since I was 13 and now to this day (ten years later) I think I can say with some degree of confidence that the only people who ever seemed to truly care about how I felt even tho they didn't know me very well (mental health ""professionals"" included) were those who I know have been through the same shit and know what it is like. Everyone else feels like they're from a different fucking dimension of emotional shallowness (which is something said by me of all people). I'm not talking about big shows of unearned affection or interest (which nobody expects from strangers or acquaintances of course), but I don't think it's too much to expect normal politeness and concern towards fellow human beings in general. Unless you have something tangible in common with them most people will normally not give you the time of day or show any kind of interest in your life and wellbeing at all, or rather they will but only if it serves them some kind of purpose (e.g. if you're like me and are neurodivergent you know how most people tend to treat us as comedic relief or simply question every little thing we do just to point out how weird it is). It's so painfully obvious how not only their interest in you as a person (which I think is legit) but their empathy and compassion are very conditional too. Most people don't really give a shit about how others feel if they can't relate to them and will not even try to hide it, but those same people will describe themselves as welcoming and kind individuals, or say they care all the while not ever giving you a second thought when interacting with you.

I think it actually all boils down to ingroup-outgroup mentality or something but holy shit is it that hard to be considerate about how you make others feel? Like how stupid do you have to be to not realize that you will meet countless people who are already this close to offing themselves but are still trying their best, only to have a rude and self centered person make them feel even more like shit than they already do? Just stop pretending you care about others if this is the regard you show them."
15,Everybody I've met in life has it better. What's the point in living with nothing?,"I'm in my early 30s (F) and I'm a failure. I'm no one. I can't keep a job, currently have no employment and I'm running out of the little money I have left. I rent a tiny studio in a bad neighborhood, but soon I won't be able to even afford that. I have no support network. My parents are dead. They were unsupportive, poor and left me nothing. For the past years, every person or friend I met in my life, or every relative I had, has had it way better. Either they had money or at least a nice family, a good job or something. I'm not talking about seeing things on social media - I actually knew those people and saw their lives, visited their homes etc. Some of them were even bought a house by their parents. Or a car. Or given money or at least help, support and kindness. And I? I could never count on my family. My family gave me depression only and instilled insecurity in me for the rest of my life. I feel too old to fight it. I don't want to fool myself with hope anymore. I'm sick of seeing happy and lucky people with things they consider standard and take for granted while to me those things are luxury I'll never have. I push those people away because I can't relate to them. I know, money is not everything. But it sure is better to cry in your own house than in a shitty studio you're about to get kicked out of. I wonder why I've been dealt these shitty cards. I desperately go to interviews for jobs I'm perfect for, I prepare thoroughly and I still don't get selected. I've only had a few jobs and a lot of gaps. I'm stupid, so I have no degree. I'm just sick of my efforts being useless every time I try. I'm not allowed to even have minimum happiness in life, it seems. Wish killing yourself was easier, then I would have done it long ago."
16,I'm a piece of shit,"Im a 17M and this morning I accidentally woke up a couple hours late. I forgot to set my alarm last night and my stepfather was screaming at me, calling me a failure in life and yelling at me for not having a job even though I've been trying. My parents have been pissed at me because I've been smoking again. I've been having suicidal thoughts all day since this morning I get them often. I don't know what to do and everyone hates me. I'm starting to think I really am a piece of shit and I don't do jack. I'm nothing but a liability to the people around me."
17,I did it once,"M26. Back in high school I pulled myself out of my misery and got in shape, but then I had a motivation. I had a crush on a female friend of mine, and her constant praise and support at me bettering myself drove me forward. I didn't care about getting in shape. I didn't care about myself at all. The only reason I went from an overweight loner to a confident person who was the best player on our football team was the thought that if I could change myself enough then she would be attracted to me. I spent my entire time from 9th to 12th grade becoming one of the most physically fit guys in the entire school, heck I won our schools weight lifting competition. The whole time she cheered me on, and made me feel like I was accomplishing something. Then in senior year I did it. I asked her out one day after our football team won. I was so sure that she would say yes. I had spent all this time listening to what she said about what she found attractive in a man to her other friends, and I did everything to meet those standards. I have never felt as confident as I did in that moment, but of course she rejected me. She smiled and said she didn't want to ruin our good friendship, and that was that. Everything else in my life was miserable but the thought that I would win her over kept me going, and with her rejection of me I just stopped caring. I had spent years working out, and taking care of myself, because I thought I had a chance with her. In the end, even at my best, I wasn't good enough. I still carry that thought with me now even 8 years later. Even my best isn't good enough. I let myself go and slowly returned to being an out of shape loser. I even stopped talking to most of the other friends I had made on the football team. It is pathetic, but I never recovered. Now at 26 I am busy with my job and taking care of my elderly grandmother, so I have little time for anything else. I keep trying to get started on getting in shape and getting a girlfriend, but I just can't seem to find the time or motivation to do it. I feel as though I am unworthy of happiness. I feel like a failure. I mean I can't even summon the resolve to ask women out. I don't care about myself, and I want to find someone else to care about instead.

Advice? 

I don't think anything will help, but it is worth a shot I suppose.

18,A little rant,"So I have suicidal ideation and I have been depressed for a year. Some people think I shouldn't be suicidal because I ""have not been depressed for long enough, it's only been a year !"" But see, this is why I'm valid. I don't care for these rules of needing to be depressed for a long enough time, I don't care for rules I only care about the problem at hand. What dictates my suicidal ideation is purely the reason for it, not some rules about needing to wait. If you need to follow these rules then you aren't truly suicidal, it means that you're depressed but you still have some will to live, you still have some fight in you that you want to harness to better your situation. For me the pain is too much so I can't bear to weight, and that urgency is why I'm truly suicidal."
19,"Basic care gone, has my body given up before my mind?","Hey, does anyone else have issues with basic care down to even wanting to sleep? I feel like its not worth taking care of myself anymore, I don't want to die but I don't want anything. I don't want to eat, I don't feel hungry or thirsty anymore, I am tired no matter how much I sleep and everything feels like a chore or burning time.

The only time I feel anything other than tired and empty is when I wake up from a nocturnal panic attack. Its this panicked sense of calm hoping its a heart attack almost, its happened a few times and with that plus nightmares I just don't wanna sleep. its not worth worsening my mental state over if i am exhausted no matter what. 

I don't have anyone to turn to, I recently lost them and I don't have family that can help. I've tried talking to a therapist, pastor and a handful of  councilors. I am constantly talking to someone just so I am not rotting but is the void really that bad? It almost feels like I have to so people know I am not dead. I just feel like nothing matters, like at all- nothing. Life goes on anyways and I try being positive but its so hard when the only fucking person you felt gave any remote fuck about you calls you selfish for putting yourself first as they asked! I am just not sure if my body gave up feeling before my mind. I'll be sobbing but there's not a single thought I can place in my skull, nothing at all and I am just sobbing. 

I wish I could go back in time like a month and see what the fuck went wrong lately.. I lost my everything in the last like 2 weeks and I  don't see how I'll get even that pathetic spark I had a month ago back.. or I could be a selfish asshole for having so much traumatic shit happen to me beyond my own control

&#x200B;

TLDR: Why even bother when you don't even want to sleep? let alone do anything at all

Advice is welcome if you even have any. And yes, I've tried medications and been in therapy along time with not much help."
20,I'm so tired,"Everyday I wake up wishing I hadn't, just the thought of what my life has been and what it is now is enough to just rip any sense of joy away from me. Everything I've tried to do with my life so far has failed, I don't have a job, I've never been in a relationship and I don't even own a car. I can't be around people anymore because my anxiety's so bad that I feel like I'm about to have a panic attack whenever I'm alone in public. For a while I was getting better, I could hold a job and although it wasn't a very good job I did feel like I finally had some sense of belonging. Then I made the mistake of going back home for a job with better pay which was a mistake. I didn't mind the work but it was stressful and it didn't take long before a coworker dicided he didn't like me. The constant shit-talking and complaints about my work that was just complete bullshit got to me and after a while of trying to fix the issue I just gave up. I can't take that kind of treatment  everyday so I left and the next job made me absolutely miserable so it didn't last either. I didn't talk to anyone outside of what was needed in order to do my job because I just didn't want to have anymore problems but isolating myself made me feel extremely depressed to the point where I couldn't even get up to go to work anymore. I went to get help and got put on medication that doesn't really help and I know I won't be able to hold a job unless I get better. I've tried everything I could, I even got into fitness and made some real progress in that area but I still feel awful. I thought it would help but I still struggle to get out of bed in the morning and I don't feel any better about myself. I'm back to living with my family which I promised myself I'd never go back to. These are the same people who beat and neglected me as a child and now I'm stuck living with them. All of that effort to get away and I'm back here with these lunatics. I feel like I have no power over my life anymore and I'm tired of being in this place but I can't leave. When I think of my life I just want it to end, I can't even imagine myself having a normal life anymore and I don't want to live like this anymore. I'm just so tired of this and I don't know if I can take it anymore. I'm just a failure of a human being and I can't even take care of myself."
21,Help me please.,I havent told anyone this so ill say it here to help me get comfortable telling my parents or someone im close with. I dont know why but for some reason one day i woke up in december i was overwhelmed with suicidal and homicidal thoughts. I have been angry at people in my school for the things they have done to me mentally and physically. I cant take it anymore. the homicidal thoughts have somewhat cooled off by now but the suicidal thoughts have gotten 10x worse. Im trying to get rid of both thoughts.
22,It’s getting bad again ,"How do you know it’s getting bad……. For me it’s just realizing that I haven’t showered in in over a week and still not having the energy to get up and shower…..

23,Blocked a friend,"""Friend"" started texting me again after a long period of silence, I believe his aim was to bait me into a fight by saying outrageous and repulsive things. Strange thing is some of my other friends were on his side claiming that's just a ""living life"" for a gay teen, but I thought it was absolutely disgusting. In the end I blocked him but not before he threatened to give my phone number to an old stalker. Anyways now I'm upset and now my other friend is upset and I fucked up and I guess everyone hates me. Just everything on this planet is so upsetting maybe I'm too sensitive idk. I don't think anybody can help, but I've got nobody to vent to anymore. "
24,Is being dead better than being alive,"So a couple months ago on my 26th birthday, one of my best friends of 13 years passed away in a head-on car accident leaving work. I was and still am heartbroken over it but in some way I recently discovered that death isn’t as bad as we think and how she’s away from this cruel world. A memory I remember is how we were at my apartment last year around March with 2 other friends at 1am discussing the trials and tribulations of life and what we were all dealing with in adulthood. I used to think “Man they’re gone they didn’t get to experience this” but what are they really missing? Besides bills, stress, etc. There are some good things to life don’t get me wrong but I get why others always told me “don’t be sad they’re gone, they’re in a better place.”"
25,HBD 30,"It's my 30th bday.
I'm generally a sad human. 
Lonely but also distant.
Spent half the night before my birthday arguing with SO.
Spent the other half unable to cope with the aftermath. 
Now alone. Drunk. High. And I cant stop fucking crying. And 30. 
Yay, another year?

26,18M Aus ,"Hey everyone I don’t know why I’m posting this but I need to tell someone and who better then strangers, I’m an 18 year old bloke from qld I’m just going to say everything, I’m diagnosed with severe PSTD, severe anxiety, severe depression and I have 
hallucinations (while completely sober) I am unfortunately using drugs, I’ve lost absolutely everything, every single one of my friends who I’d known for years basically my whole life, I lost my girlfriend who was so incredible, I haven’t spoken to my mum in a year, I haven’t spoken to my twin sisters in about a year and a half and I’ve never really known my dad, I used to run a business I made about 350k from when I was 15-17 I loved my life having come from a “junkie home” I was just for once happy, and it’s all gone, I cannot do this anymore. I seriously just can’t I hate myself, I’m alone, like really alone oh yeah and I might be going to jail, seriously I just want to give up and I don’t see any reason why I shouldn’t anymore

27,What kept me alive (I hated my life but not life) - but not a perfect feel good story,"I had a break down a year ago and planned to end it all. Luckily my boss gave me a month off from teaching and it gave me breathing space. 

At the time I was unhappy with my work, my home, my health, my love life, I'd lost a lot of friends who left the country, and I wasnt really getting anywhere with my career.

I only have a few grand in savings (but live in Asia) so I took my motorbike into the country and just lived in farmstays and drove the bike through the wilderness each day. I'd originally planned to end it all after a few weeks of travel, but within one week I no longer wanted to die. 

I remember seeing a bunch of kids driving on a tractor, waving at me and laughing, and I smiled and laughed for the first time in months. 

Within just a few weeks I began to remember the joys of life - music, adventure, meeting people, drinking, travel, reading etc. 

I returned to work a month later and even began dating and functioning normal again. 

The only kicker is one year later, I'm back in the work grind, just suffered a break up and find myself struggling again. 

Anyway, the point is - most of us hate our lives but dont actually hate life.

I know this isnt profound, but hopefully it helps a few who just need a holiday and to re-think what matters to them"
28,Mom's anniversary ,"I (29f) lost my mom when I was 16. My dad didn't know how to be a proper parent and didn't force me into going to any place for help, which was definitely needed because she died so unexpectedly. Fast forward to 2021, and my dad gets diagnosed with metastatic stage 4 colonrectal cancer that had got into his brain as well. This sent me into the spiral I have not been able to get out of. I go to therapy 2x a week and hell I'm even a case manager at a local MHMR so it also makes me feel so hyprocictal at times. Anyways, my dad fought an 18 month hard battle and of course didn't make it. This led to my grief wounds being ripped open again and the bleeding I feel like has been even worse because of the fact that I was never taught how to grieve when I was 16. Anyways, tomorrow is her death anniversary and I'm just not ready. I have to go to work and I have clients scheduled that I know are going to make tomorrow easier but if yall could just send good jujus that I keep it together tomorrow/this weekend, I'd greatly appreciate it. "
29,I'm done,"I can't quite go through with it yet - I'm going to do my best to wait til after a big event later in the year, then go through with it. Hopefully ill have some good memories with family and friends by then.

If things get too bad before then I won't wait, but yeah. 

I have a very cheap, very failsafe method. Im going to buy it tomorrow in case it stops being available before my date. If I do it carefully and with some sleeping meds to knock me out for it, It's kind of scary how easy it'll be.

I'll go to a quiet, lonely beach, send out some messages, do it, then go to sleep. I'm quite happy with my plan.

I feel a little grief for the life I could've lived but there's no hope of accomplishing it anymore, so I'd have grief even if i chose life instead. I can at least slip away quietly with nobody to hurt and not be missed. I may as well do one more act of kindness towards myself. My soul is forever injured, and will never heal, so putting myself down would be the most humane thing. 

No, I really dont have anything to live for. I am truly alone in the world, and existence is too painful to bear in too many ways."
30,i need help...,"today i was trying to be funny so i can get more freinds. but instead i just got bullied even more, i went into the restroom and cried.Any advice for my situation?"
31,Why am I so invisible?,"Idk what’s wrong with me. I have been in university for four years now, and I’ve barely made one friend. I constantly put myself out there and try to talk to people in my classes, particularly girls because I am one, but they either flat out ignore me or talk to someone else while I’m right there. I am really starting to feel invisible, like nobody would even notice if I disappeared. My friends outside of school have no trouble making other friends and I’m starting to feel like I’m just becoming a nuisance because they’re the only people I have to talk to. My mom suggested that maybe it’s because people are intimidated by me. I took this into consideration and put in extra effort to smile more, talk to more people, have a more approachable demeanor. This hasn’t worked and I still feel like a complete loser. I mean, there was an instance where I approached two other classmates and they flat out ignored me. I said hi again and this time they looked at me and just continued their conversation as if I wasn’t even worth saying hi back to. I make an effort to not say anything that could be interpreted as mean or rude just in case I’m saying the wrong things by mistake but I still get treated the same way. Apparently these are the years where you find your life long friends. What am I doing wrong? "
32,How do I get better? (TW),"I need to for my family.

I've just been relapsing (sh) and running away from my responsibilities.

If it was just me, I wouldn't care, but it's not. I have an obligation to keep myself going for the people I love, and it seems like I can't anymore.

How do I fix this?"
33,Living is overrated,Everyone wants love and if you are not available to give love they fuck you up…
34,"TW: sh, si","I’m really struggling at the moment and I’m not sure what to do. I am waiting on a mental health assessment which is booked for next week, and I have a call with a pharmacist on Monday to discuss the meds I’m on and see what would be good. 
I feel absolutely nothing and I can't do anything. I'm signed off work at the moment which is good because I wouldn't be able to go, but I just feel so empty? I can't articulate my thoughts properly so I don't even know why I feel like this?
My nightmares are bad, I can't sleep properly. I know I just need to wait until next week but it's honestly so hard. My si has got worse to the point where I just don't want to be here. 
I’m not sure who I can talk to, my family know I’m struggling but not this bad, I don't really have any close friends any more to confide in.  
I also feel like how I’m feeling is wrong? Something I’m trying to work through with my therapist but I only see her once a week and it's good in the moment and then I can't seem to help myself outside of sessions. 
I've got feelings of guilt and shame, I think that I’m not that bad and then I feel like this, I’m so conflicted. 

Does anyone else feel the same way? I can't keep going like this "
35,i just want to end it all,i hate this i dont want to live anymore no one listens no one understands why cant they just listen for once without shouting and getting mad at me? i have no one to tell about ny feelings i wanna cry but i cant even do that since i have no privacy here i dont see the point anymore honestly. please just kill me.
36,How do I meet people?,"Have never been in a relationship, have never experienced any kind of romantic affection/intimacy. Too insecure about myself to get on Tinder or any other online dating platform. My current job kinda forces me to work from home so I don't really get to meet anyone. On the rare occasion that I do, I'm always scared that I'll creep them out so interactions stay minimal. Besides, I have almost nothing in common with most women so there would probably be nothing to even talk to them about. I'm just a sad loser with a crippling masturbation addiction who does nothing but jerk off, play video games, and watch anime (hitting the gym has sort of alleviated the addiction at least). Not trying to be sexist/misogynistic or anything btw, I'm aware there are plenty of women who play video games and/or watch anime, I've just never met them, and have no idea how to even meet them, at least not in my country. Either way, I'm fairly confident none of them would ever want to meet me or have anything to do with me. I'm not particularly attractive or smart or talented at anything, I have nothing to offer them.  
Sorry about the rant, I'm just very alone. I don't even have any actual friends to talk to about this. And lately, it's been a lot harder to drown out the bad thoughts no matter how much weight I lift/what games I play."
37,I dont even know man,"I hate everyone around me and I feel like a terrible person all the time, I don't wanna die but i don't wanna live either, sometimes I feel like the only thing keeping me away from running away or something else is my mother's reaction I can't do that to her. I wish I could just dissappear and be erased from everyone's memory"
38,Is this hell?,"I made an attempt on my life in 2016 and again in 2018. I have a feeling that I succeeded the first time and this is actually hell. My logical reasoning is that pure agony the entire time would get old but if you have breaks in-between the steadily escalating torture the suffering is increased by the hopes of seeing a silver lining.

Well anyways I just got the news that I'll be homeless withing the next month so I get to lose everything I've been working myself into the ground for including my cats, dogs and pet raccoon. My wife too but honestly it's not much of a loss as she's the primary reason that I'm losing everything anyways."
39,why do people hate me?,"It's difficult to guess, as haters leave me, usually."
40,"Do things like exercising regularly, eating healthy, and having a regular sleep schedule actually help?","Everyone always tells me to do these three things without actually taking my feelings into account. It's very frustrating, especially because the people who constantly say this to me have never been depressed in their lives. So does it work or is it just something people say to brush you off and avoid talking with you about your feelings?"
41,so depressed i wanna end it ,hello i’m super drunk and i feel bad i have a good  family life they love me very much but i can’t find any positives in life i know that most people have worst lives then me but i cannot find the light at the end of the tunnel a women broke up with me about 2 months ago and i cannot seem to get over it  also i have no money at all and am going into a degree that will make no money (graduating in may) all my roomates have women and  i cannot seem to handle it again i know most people have shitter lives then me but i really don’t what do i feel like i  wanna die and really will have no positives in life i really don’t have any money no women no degree and once i graduate i will have nothing im so so sorry about  life i feel like a pos because people in life have it  so much harder in life then me but i wanna die i csnnot find a job will not do anything in life and i just wanna end it to be honest i don’t care if anyone responds i just hope you all are doing well im soo so sorry i just don’t know what to do with my life i wll never find a women or. a job i just wanna raise a family and have a simple job thank you again 
42,peace for 1 damned sec?,"I'm holding on by screaming my hate here. 
But every time I feel like violence is the answer!
I feel hurt and reject, did I matter?
You know the pain, they fake the feel.
I used to writes happy things, but now remain no thrill
They're a crow in my mind and names he whisper
If that bicth at work won't quiet, her death wish I May listen. 
Despiste the despair I've always rise back, this time is different they're no more road no more tracks. 
An empty head must a precious thing 
Mind so full of darken memory and unpleasant screaming.
Maybe  I'll post that, it may or not be read, but here I was talking to one who share my meal, an untasty one echoing our life of misery"
43,I don’t know what else to do other than end it,"I’ve had severe depression for years now and whoever I talk to says the same damn thing every time. I’m sick and tired of the same conversation from every person. I can’t even talk to my own mother for fear of her betraying or abandoning me. I’ve been cutting myself over and over but I can’t tell anyone because I don’t trust anyone. I went to multiple therapists but they always said the same thing. It’ll get better, or you aren’t alone. They always say it but it never happens. I have no friends left who I believe can or would even be willing to help me. Been thinking about ending it for some time now. I’ve contacted the hotline numerous times as well but it feels like a script every time. It seems like nobody genuinely cares unless you’re dangling off of a bridge or have a gun to your head. And even then it’s not that they don’t want you dead. They just don’t want to feel the guilt of knowing that they could have changed the outcome. But even then I feel like I deserve that sometimes. I can’t stop thinking about horrible things like killing people around me for no reason or just doing horrible things in general to people I just walk past in public. That makes me a bad person doesn’t it? Thinking endlessly of hurting or killing innocent people around me? Either way I feel as though I’ve tried it all and genuinely don’t know what to do anymore other than just end it.

44,Vicious Cycle,"Hi all, 

I (24m) have been dealing with depression and being overweight for years, and I believe they are very much linked. It's also a mixture of growing up with critical parents and attending a college prep high school and probably not being cut out for something like that. Lately I've been feeling a bit more depressed and maybe a bit hopeless because I just graduated with my bachelor's degree last spring, and now here I am back in school to complete prerequisites for a healthcare oriented job. It sounds like a really good career, but the schooling seems a bit daunting given my history of not doing well in science classes. I feel that I'm just not a really academic person.

 I'm hoping this depression is something I can work through and fix with medication, diet, and exercise. I'd love to hear about anyone else who's stuck in a cycle like I am - I work my job and feel depressed, then sign up for classes, then lack the drive to do well in those classes, and feel overwhelmed by taking two classes and working full time. Has anyone overcome something like this, or just changed their perspective and grown from it? 

Thanks! :) "
45,Why am I getting bad grades all of a sudden,"This might sound really dumb but I feel like the universe is against me in my last semester of university. I need a good GPA as I want to get into law school (laugh if you want), I was doing fine so far but for some reason this semester is so shit. My courses consist of a lot of essay work and I always get it done and today I got my first C on an assignment (aside from stats) which was worth a lot. And now I missed the deadline for another assignment (luckily only 1% a day penalty), and then I bombed a quiz on another class. All of this is piling up and I feel so overwhelmed. I know the only logical answer is to push through but why does one bad thing keep happening after another. I do my work as I've always done and for some reason it's throwing a punch right back at me to my gut. Everytime I get an assignment I'm scared to do it. It sounds dumb but I used to have depression and was suicidal and I don't want to go back to that. I have a chance to actually get into a decent school and start fresh but the universe doesn't want that apparently."
46,Jealous,"Im so jealous of my friend who is just able to function. She enjoys so many hobbies and loves keeping herself busy, she's motivated and aims high, she loves talking to and meeting new people, she's so well spoken and can communicate her feelings.

My own mind is my enemy.

48,What’s the worst habit you pick up when going through it?,"Me, my hygiene and self care goes through the window. From showering, to eating. 
And then I’ll get an urge and I’ll become obsessed with hygiene. I’ll physically work myself to death, I brush and floss my teeth multiple times a day until they bleed, I’ll diet my body into oblivion etc."

Don't even fuckin' enjoy when i have a day off, can't even think about owt else but work, I fuckin' hate it, I hate it, an' it's not even that bad. Part-time, now full-time? Despised 'em both. An' this is all there is to living! Nowt'll convince me otherwise. I'd hack me own bloody fingers off with a butter knife if it meant I didn't have to go in tomorrow. I'd rather spend a day in A&E gettin' em stitched back on than a fuckin' hour at work. Dread it so much I can't sleep because of -and if I do- I wake up with my stomach fuckin' burning out of dread, I feel so sick it sends me dizzy, feel it before I even open my eyes. I grind an' clench my teeth so much during the day I've started t' feel the pressure between my temples and in my nose. Spent all the time I had t' be happy miserable, and now this is all that'll be fer yonks. I hate working, I hate it so much, and havin' Asperger's only accentuates the extent to which I struggle with it all, fuck my life to pieces, I fuckin' hate work, I hate my job, I've hated every fuckin' job I've had. I can't take workin' eight days with one day off in-between, can't take workin' five. I don't wanna fuckin' go to work tomorrow. I won't enjoy the day off neither."

I have noticed though that it gets much much worse about two days before my period and the whole time I'm on it (This is how it's been since like age 12 or 13). So rn, on top of my regular depressive episode, I'm on my periodddddd. Basically I'm not doing very good and I'm not exactly sure what to do to help myself get out of this, I feel like I'm drowning in this weird double depression hell.

53,"To all fellow users I wanted to ask how deal with depression and anxiety causing due to FOMO

Heyy this is my first time writing something online for advice ( also please forgive for my poor English) I am college student and i joined it at mid semester so there was already groups formed. But I was ready to make new friends. But then past few my didn't go as planned I don't have friends yeah i know significant people in class but no one who I hangout with or whom invite me to hangout. And this making constantly making me anxious and overwhelmed while seating in class and i started to skip class. But again as I skip class college festivals,events and those peoples enjoying together all that really develop FOMO IN ME. I was good student from my childhood like really good in academics due to my parents whom always making me study but now I look back i starting to think its all there fault they never encourage me play outside to go out with friends they always said friendship is not good when I was child so as I grow up due to the fear I never asking for even permission to sometime hangout with friends. And that made who I am now . So I just wanted to ask other users  how should I now get out that depression and anxious feeling and get better at socializing and be happy again"
54,Can't escape infinite cycle of study,My parents have always had unrealistic expectations of me and that's because all they want me to do is study. At home my parents are always expecting me to be studying and at school I also have to study too of course but the thing is everyone calls me a nerd. So I have no friends and that affects my grades and that makes my parents mad so that l leads to more study. I feel very hopeless so I stroke my snake everyday I forgot to mention I'm 13. I think there is something wrong with me. I'm depressed and I have constant suicidal thoughts. I also have anger issues. I'm stressed I don't even know why I'm typing this there's no hope this is just a random post anyway. And I won't last for long I just wanted to type to ease my mind but this isn't working I'm gonna go goodbye.

56,feeling sad lately ,"I have bad anxiety / depression and it’s easy for me to spiral when something happens — my friend literally just stopped talking out of nowhere a few days ago and I’ve kinda just been sad about it. Part of me thinks it has to be my fault because one of our last few convos was me saying sad things & maybe I overwhelmed them and maybe they think I’m too much. It’s so hard for me to open up because when I did to my parents they’d usually just shut down whatever I’m saying and I feel like every time I talk to that one friend about something that it some how disconnects us in some way even if they don’t directly tell me so. It’s such a vicious cycle of never understanding how others actually feel and if what im saying could be affecting them negatively in some way. I try not to delve too much on my issues, I don’t usually bring up this type of stuff to people I personally know, but sometimes it just becomes too much and I need to let some of it go. 

I know I’m just rambling and probably overreacting.. it’s only been a few days but for some reason I just feel really sad about it. I feel like I’ve been kept out in the dark and it’s been really difficult for me to comprehend anything. I can’t even sleep that well right now because of all the bad thoughts I’ve been having. Like there’s a part of my brain saying that this isn’t a big deal and I’m playing constant tug of war with another part of my brain telling me that it’s all going to turn to shit & I just don’t really know what is real or what to trust about my thoughts anymore. All I do is cry, bed rot and distract myself all day. 

I hate this fear of losing people and it’s consuming me entirely too much and for a seemingly small reason. Crying is not fun 

Edit: i think they will be back, im just having some mental health troubles "
57,small rant,"I'm not good at anything. I picked up bass in Christmas 2022 but haven't made any noticeable progress as of yet. I joined the jazz band in my school, which had been going well.

Then my grades kept slipping in every class because there's just no point in trying. I'm gonna die eventually anyways.

Then my mom put me into online school instead, and I really don't see the point in trying. Like I said, nothing I do will every matter.

Then just today I find out I'm not in jazz band because I haven't been going.

The one thing I looked forward to in school. Gone. I just don't see the point anymore."

I know i shouldn’t think about the past but it’s the only thing reminding me that i used to be happy at one point and motivated but i also think about all the bad stuff that happened which has more of an affect on me now and it really brings me down because i feel like i let everyone around me down and im not strong enough to get help
Im a loser and a fuck up why did this happen to me i just wanted to make people happy but now i don’t even recognize myself , everyday im scared ima lose someone i love and im going to regret not spending moments with them or feeling like i could’ve done more , im so tired of trying to live a normal or go bck to how things were because my mindset has changed so much i don’t know if ill ever be happy again.

61,I don’t know what I’m doing anymore and don’t know how to function,"My ex and I broke up a week ago and it’s gone from me crying to feeling numb. I feel sick when I eat, I lay in bed all day, I don’t want to do anything. And when I do get up it takes everything out of me to do the bare minimum. Everyone keeps telling me it will get easier but I feel so empty. I was already struggling and this break up was the final straw to send me back down this path. I’m trying to force myself out of the house but I just feel so much worse when I do. I don’t know what to do anymore. Any advice? 

TLDR I’m struggling to do anything in life and feel hopeless. Looking for advice on how you’d deal with it "
62,Muscular dystrophy and depression ,"I was diagnosed with Becker’s muscular dystrophy in December. It’s a progressive disease that causes muscle wasting. I didn’t take the news that hard when the doctors were telling me about it but now it’s all I think about. Additionally, I experienced a horrible lower back strain in November and it has slightly healed but I think I’m always going to have lower back pain because of how weak my muscles are. Ever since then I have started getting pain in my knees, groin, ankles, and shoulders. I can still walk but at the price of putting more strain on my knees, ankles, and back.

I have had only had a few nights of decent sleep since my back strain thanks to the power of drugs. I fear I am always going to be dependent on them. I think about my future and know I won’t ever have a life of normalcy. I’ll will always be uncomfortable in my body and probably going to be that way until I die. I think about how I used to enjoy my life when I didn’t display any symptoms and was always  positive and patient. I don’t even recognize that person anymore. I grieve who I once was and hope I can accept who I am now. It’s only been 3 months so maybe I just need more time to cope and I hope I’ll find some way to mitigate all my pain. 

I have been thinking about dying a lot lately but I am terrified of the pain I would bring on myself and my family. Not to mention the unknown. My life could be a lot worse as well and I tell myself that when I’m feeling really down. It kinda helps but not really. 

Thank you for reading all this. I know everyone is going through terrible shit in this sub and I hope you find a way to get through it.

63,I'm drowning and it's my fault,"I'm in the second semester of my junior year of college. I'm struggling bad. I've barely gone to any of my classes, in one class i've done maybe one assignment, because I don't know what the assignments are because I rarely go to class.

 I sleep until 1pm most days, except now I drag myself to some classes because if I don't i'll be kicked out of them. I ace my tests and the stuff i do hand in comes out great, but that doesn't matter much when i'm not doing 90 percent of it.

 I got dxd with severe anxiety and moderate depression so got put on prozac 10mg this past month, and it was starting to help. I was starting to show up, do things i needed to do, take care of myself, until I upped my dose to 20mg, which caused severe dizziness and sickness and i couldn't go to class, and this past week i became so depressed I had to see the crisis counselor on campus.

 I lowered my dose back to 10mg but that was only a couple days ago, and right now I'm looking at all the shit i fucked up for myself. I've dug myself so deep I don't think there's a way out. I'm working with the dean of students and with my counselor, and my advisor, but I haven't met with the dean of students yet to work anything out. I don't want to take a break. That's not something I want to do.

 The sad part is? I LOVE the content in my classes. Greek mythology? Hell yeah! Archeology? One of my passions! But I don't enjoy them at all. I dread having to get out of bed. Part of it is because it's winter, it's cold out and miserable and I physically don't want to walk in this shit. 

But yesterday I walked OUT of the end of my midterm and left a note in the essay section saying I felt sick. Which I did. I keep feeling like I'm going to be sick, and my stomach hurts, and the dizziness is just wearing off now. I hate myself! I avoid my responsibilities and play around on my computer or talk to my friends when i KNOW I should be working on stuff, but i just plain don't, and then I hate myself for it.

 I feel like a prisoner in my own mind. I know the right things to do I just don't do them. And things I used to enjoy i don't anymore. Writing? I feel like the worst writer in the world, art? haven't touched it in months, cooking? I'm lucky if I can get myself to eat saltines these days. I've lost eight pounds in the past week. 

My room is a trash heap, haven't done my laundry in two weeks, in every area of my life I am failing, and I am a disaster. My GPA is for sure going to drop this semester. I don't understand it. I used to be an academic weapon! But now I'm an academic mess. Help. Please. I don't know what I'm doing. I'm trapped in this cycle of avoidance and self criticism.

64,You can’t win anymore,"The prevailing culture is one that tears people down and emphasises one’s own self importance.

This leads to people being highly self centred and highly individualistic.

Any deviation from what others think is seen as outright violation of some sort of moral BS hierarchical code they have that is total BS. 

It’s always been hard to make relationships but now it’s god damn impossible. You can’t get ahead anymore either as there’s always someone on the other side waiting to knock you across the head or tear you down. 

I swear other people think others are just avatars in their life and not actually real alive people with their own subjective experience and life. 

People are just focused on self gain and f**k everyone else. They are full of BS. 

I just want out at this point. What a disaster we have created. "
65,"I'm at my lowest low, and I have no one. Needing to vent.","20 M. The last month and a half has been horrible for me. Been getting barely any shifts at work, and as a result have no money. Me and my girlfriend, who I loved more than anything in the world, broke up. I'm very stressed, and I don't think I've ever felt more alone. I can't cry, I can't feel happy, all I feel is a void, I can't feel anything. I just feel an incredible force weighing me down. Last night I purposely broke a glass and cut my arm with it, and I'm scared knowing what I might be capable of at the moment.

It's horrible. I've dealt with depression for as long as I can remember, yet December was quite possibly the best month of my life, I've never felt happier. Everything felt like it was looking up. I had plans, I was happy with my girl, and life finally felt good. And boom. January rolls around and bit by bit, everything falls apart. I'm so fucking done, I feel like I can barely function. I have to work tomorrow and I don't feel like I can do it. 

I hate being like this. Last few years I've done my absolute best only to look up, no matter what I face. I figure I only have one life, so I might as well try my best with it no matter what bad shit happens. Yet right now, all I can think about is if I'd be better off dead. I can't take this anymore right now."
66,i fuckinf hate my life,"i really hate my life so much , all the bad things happened to me i got abused when im young even now , i fucking hate myself so much , ill be dead tonight. all this shit making my life miserable , and fuck my face and body for being bad to me i fucking hate my life"
67,I feel really alone,"I can't burden my friends and family with my negativity. It's not their responsibility to heal me. Yes, I've went to them for support but I'm still broken and I feel like I can't fix myself. And I can't fix this broken world either. I've been thinking about suicide a lot these few days."
68,Will do right by my feelings no matter what,"So I’ve been the most depressed I’ve ever been in my life this year. It has been shocking to get to this level of misery. And yet most days you spend them non-reactive, numb, like you don’t care. I’m not sure why. 

I spent so many months waiting for a message from her. The girl that broke my heart into pieces. Because I just couldn’t accept that she was gone. But I never did anything.

I want to make a statement about what people usually advice when going through a breakup. Not everything happens for a reason. In fact, the only salvation from suffering is that we may draw the strength that lets us consciously learn from suffering. But this isn’t a given, and it pisses me off that it is suggested otherwise. If everything happened for a reason, suicide would not exist. Rape and war wouldn’t, either. 

But anyway, I often check my gallery and Instagram stories from a year ago and get really melancholic and thoughtful. 

I thought about how my heart yelled for her to come back, to say something - anything. Everyday I’d open up my messages and feel bad whenever I didn’t see anything from her. An apology. A genuine apology. But things don’t work that way. Bad people won’t apologize because they knew they did wrong, or they never cared.


Just like I had fantasies of death everyday and felt like it would bring peace to all my suffering, having her say something really felt like it would help. But she never did. And I never went back to her, because she never felt sorry for toying with my feelings. And never cared. 


I guess that as a last act of respect and love for my depression, existential crisis and pain, it is fitting that she never came back. It kinda gives me peace as well, in a weird sense. I guess that a part of me died with her, because she meant love and compassion for me. She meant there being significance to romantic love. I am okay with it ending forever. A part of me has thought maybe from October to now that I kinda wish she forgot about me forever. That she never as much as recognized me if she were to see me in the street. "
69,have you succeeded where i have not? how? and if not how have you learned to maximize your life around it ? ( kinda venty ),"man FUCK 

how is progress supposed to be achieved when it takes a hundred superman's worth of strength just to wake up before 2 pm take a shower and cry at the computer the rest of the day? 

well, hold on you say all that effort could be rerouted to more progressive actions/interactions. 

I don't know how I have never been able to resolve or cope with emotional turmoil very well I don't know if I was never taught how, I hate the words I don't know cause it's my only answer to any questions that really matter "" what do you want to do "" never knew still don't  "" what are your plans for the future "" dude I really don't know "" why aren't you like your sibling "" I could not tell you I really wish I could.

sometimes it feels like there's a second me in my head strangling my motivation and whispering poison into my thoughts.

70,I find it hard to believe I could have depression. ,"I visited my army psychiatrist and was diagnosed with clinical depression and prescribed lexapro. To be honest, I still don't believe it. Reading other other people's experiences here, I don't think I'm depressed. I can still more or less function day-to-day, just that I struggle with motivation, self-esteem, hopelessness and constant exhaustion. I don't have any trauma or hardship growing up either so I think I'm just weak and lazy. I don't know. Am I just a fraud and faking it to take the easy way out?

Taking antidepressants also alters your brain chemistry, right? I'm worried about it affecting me negatively if it turns out there's nothing actually wrong with me. Should I be taking this medication?"
71,Imagining about parents death,"What the fuck is wrong with me I’m constantly imagining about my parents death and being sad .

75,I feel like there is no one really there for me. ,"I’m surrounded by friends but I always feel like people just keep me at a distance no matter how hard I try to fit in. I just recently had another child and I know it’s the hormones talking again but seeing my supposed best friend with her new child and throwing all these parties for her kid … while if I was to throw one, I have no one to invite really that I feel like would actually come. I always cherished a small handful of people as friends but now it just feels even more lonely cause I don’t even think those handful of friends actually view me as their closest friend. 

Even at work, all the other coworkers got some sort of baby shower … I got nothing. Not even a little card or anything. No gifts whatsoever. And yet I attended all the other baby showers. 

My boyfriend works at my old job and they didn’t know about us until our second kid. First kid, they didn’t give anything to me but once we got the second kid and realized my boyfriend is the dad, they all gave gifts all of a sudden. It’s like no one wants to give me anything or help me out. 

I’m just destined to just go through life alone I guess even if there are people around me. My first child prefers my boyfriend/her dad. My boyfriend keeps saying that he’ll leave or something along those lines (although, he says it’s all a joke … but saying it’s hundred times doesn’t sound like a joke anymore). Friends who don’t really try to stay in touch. "
76,Appearance and Intelligence.,"Tw: Mention of SA(Sexual Assault)

Somebody asked, how could I say life is hard?
When as a lady, I'm always on guard.
Is it normal to always feel concerned?
Well how is it not, after what I just learned.

Being a woman, lady or simpy just a teenage girl.
A hard and glistening object, like an oyster's pearl.
A lady has waists so small and breasts so big.
Whilst the lady felt the words of ""lipstick on a pig.""

Appearance is important, to give you privilege.
It's the lock I learned at such a young age.
It's the key to success, wear a tight dress.
Don't speak, don't think, don't act distress.

Is intelligence even as important anymore?
I maintain a high grade and a perfect score.
The smartest girl, the top of my class.
But all you focus is to get on top of my ass.

School is a place where teachers help you learn.
But why do they ask for something in return.
School is an institution to teach kids.
Not do something even god forbids."

I absolutely hate talking about my feelings but there are certain things I want to talk about that I can’t talk about to friends or  family but they don’t care anyways and it’s a therapist job to care. It would be an absolute waste of money for me to get one plus my parents wouldn’t get me one. 

That’s basically it but I just wanted to kinda vent about the fact today I’ve been feeling especially depressed today to I wasn’t really talking and my friend goes “are you tired or something” and I said yes and they went “ ya I can tell your grouchy today”. I didn’t even say anything or do anything I was just sitting there. This is the typa shit I would talk about but I can’t."

My fingers and hands no longer work. I can barely move my arms. I am typing this with an eye gaze device. It’s basically an iPad Pro 12.9” with eye tracking sensors. I hate this disease. I’m pretty much going to be fully paralyzed and I’ll only be able to move my eyes. It’s a high probability that I’ll pass away of respiratory failure after this disease comes for my diaphragm.

81,can depressed people still be passionate or happy?,"ive felt down low for like the past 3 years but never reached out to a professional because i thought my sadness, emptiness and anxiety was situational. i have strong goals i wanna achieve and i never really felt suicidal. though i have felt that i wanted to restart or become a different person in a different situation. 

i always feel unhappy with myself but feel the constant need to prove myself and appear fine for other people. theres some days where i feel ok and happy. but it comes down on me later. i always feel anxious about how my friends perceive me so i try to put up an “you arent my main friends and i could be alright if you left all of a sudden” act but its so mentally exhausting. i havent opened up to any of my friends in years and it all feels superficial. i feel lonely."
82,"First depressive episode in months, terrifying feeling","30M, in my third semester of community college. Before starting college, I had lost my job that I cared about very much, and my mom was moved to a rehab center after having a stroke (she’s still there), all while my dad continued recovering from his series of mini-strokes. It was the darkest point in my life, I had turned to drinking like never before; didn’t shower or shave for pretty much the entire months-long ordeal.

Then I applied for college, for the first time in my life, and slowly but surely my mood started improving. I started working hard, and I still have a 4.0 GPA. I’m currently involved in the honors and Phi Theta Kappa programs this semester also.

Everything was running smoothly, until today. I was invited last minute to a trip to the PTK regional conference, and it seemed as though we were all set for me to travel next week. I was very much looking forward to a weekend of activities and socializing. But in the middle of class today, I get a message that they were unable to secure travel accommodations for me. To say I was devastated was an understatement. I just sat frozen, time started moving slow; I just wanted out of there. I bolted out of campus as soon as I could, I wanted to just go home. But on my way home, I stopped by the liquor store to grab my ol’ reliable from those dark months this time last year. I had to call my grandparents to inform them things have changed, as I was planning on staying the night at their place the day before I was to leave; but after that, I ghosted everyone. I ghosted my mom, my dad, and the PTK group for the weekly meeting. I couldn’t, and still can’t, bear the thought of going back to college next week and having to tell everyone plans have changed. Thursday is going to suck so much, I really don’t want to be there that day but I’ll show up anyway so I don’t get marked absent. For now, I just want to drink this weekend away.

It feels like a silly thing to be this upset about, but it’s alarming just how derailing this feels towards the months of progress I made in bettering my life. I’m scared that this current episode will spiral out of control and I’ll lose everything I had worked my butt off for."

Im on antidepressants, im in therapy, yet all i can think is...whats the point in keeping going?

I have my daughter and shes the reason im still going....i couldnt put her through loosing me.
But it doesnt stop me thinking if something happened then she'd be better off 

I have no purpose other than being her mum. Soon she wont need me for most things and I'll be completely useless.

When i can't break anything, i start shaking and doing weird movements with my body, it's identical to tics. I can't control my body from shaking, but I'm fully aware of what I'm doing. Why am i acting like this??I used to do SH to regulate my emotions but now i start to break things to feel better. Im scared of actually harming the people around me.

87,My parents verbally abuse me,"Hi. I am 23(M) 
My parents verablly abuse me because they watch me play games on PC sometimes besides my studies but a lot lately becuase its my vacation right now. It's not like I play it all day , I only play games with my friends at times. But they really verbally abuses me loudly for that sometimes even when the mac's on (discord) Also they tell me get out of the house at every argument. Moreover  my mother is racist towards my girlfriend (23). I cannot leave my girlfriend for her, she is too precious to me and supported me at everything for which i am passionate about, more than my mother for the last 8 years and she is probably the only one for whom i am still going on. Moreover, my parents body shames me because I grew a little healthy in the last 2 years. Furthermore, discriminates me with my younger sister a lot. She gets to decide her life choices at everything but i dont, even in the family matters. I dont have any argument with that But the verbal abuse in the family towards me is really making me depressed. At times they hit me physically as well and If i argue about it they verbally abuses me more and more. Even my sister does that too in front of my parents and sometimes at their knowings but they don't do anything about it much saying you are a guy, why are you complaining about it? But I cannot hit her which I feel unethical because in the end she is a female person and as a male I cannot hit her in any way right? All these are making me depressed at I get suicidal thoughts every now and then. What should I do? 

Ps. I had a pretty traumatic childhood. I used to get beaten by sticks and cricket stamps if I come below 5th position in class which I did 3-4 times. I also got beaten for other purposes as well (such as coming home late at evening after sporting events, stealing little amount of money like 100 BDT (0.83 USD) from my father's pocket because they never gave me pocket money but all my friends had that and they used to spend it on their small needs in front of me, going to friend's place for internet because I did not have that until college etc.)

I thought about, if any of my friend's parents do such stuffs and even asked them about it. But I couldn't find any. They post beautiful posts sharing how much they love their parents on social media but I don't get any motivation to that because I truly don't feel like liking them at times. They never truly supported me in any of my passions (drawing, streaming, football, etc.) All these pushing me towards drugs. I have some friends who does drugs for recreational purposes but I started doing it with them for my depressions. I tried talking it out with my friends and girlfriend but they all equally feel saddened about it and what else can they do? They don't come to my house because my parents ask them u comfortable questions about me and they don't want to put me in any more trouble after what I go through everyday. I feel all these are making me addicted towards drugs and porn which I really don't want but ... I don't know what to write about it. I am just stating my thoughts here honestly.

But slowly I am feeling like I cannot take it anymore. What to do about it? "
88,I don’t know how longer I can go on.,"I’m (19 M) just so miserable. I’ve been depressed since October 2022 and nothing has changed. I’ve had moments where I felt better but I just get sucked back into the depression. Anytime I’m happy I remind myself not to be. 

I don’t know what I can do to make it stop, I spend most my nights crying. I need someone to help me. A physical person to just hold me and make me feel better. I just want someone to care about me. Check up on me. I don’t want to end up killing myself. I’m scared I might. I feel like I have nothing to lose. 

I hate everything about myself. I never really cared about my insecurities but now I feel like I’m just a disgusting person. I’m so thin and I feel weak, I just don’t eat and if I do eat it’s just snacks nothing with actual nutritional value. I just don’t want to eat.

I’m extremely lonely. I go out at night and sit on a swing near my house listening to music making up scenarios in my head about how much better my life could be. These made up scenarios are like an escape, So I sit for maybe 2-3 hours on this swing just living in these scenarios where I’m just happier. I’ve been doing this for almost 2 years now. Every chance I get I go to this swing. Sit and just imagine and it’s not healthy and I know it. 

I don’t have friends anymore and I don’t speak to my family because I’m a very awkward person. I can’t be open to people. I find it hard to speak to people. I used to be able to but now I’m just incapable. My ex made me feel like my emotions never mattered so I just stop talking about them. 

I use to be quite hopeful for the future but now I just don’t feel like my life will ever improve I’ll just get progressively worse. Just end up killing myself like my dad. 

I thought I’d be more happier by now but I’m not if anything I’m worse. I don’t know what to do. I try to keep it in but it all comes out at some point. I just want to be happy. I don’t know why I can’t be.

It's been affecting my self esteem but I had no choice but to ride it out. Once I stop my meds, will I be able to lose weight and get back to my old body?

I have had a plan to end it for a long time but that is only if 2 requirements are met. I have to lose both my dad and my grandmother in order to be comfortable ending my life because at that point I can't hurt or disappoint anyone. My outlook now is so bleak that I'm starting to wonder if I even care enough to wait for them to die. I am on blood pressure medication and I know it would be so easy to down a handful of them and go to bed. My dad doesn't care enough to check on me so I could easily lay here and die without anyone noticing for at least 24 hours prior to ingesting the pills. Idk if I want to be talked down from this ledge or if I am just sharing my pain with a group that really doesnt care either way. I know none of you and you do not know me. So what's the point?"
92,Help me please. I'm done keeping my composure.,"So I am 14, and a guy, just to get that out of the way before I say something here. I will say something I haven't even told my parents, or my closest friends.

When I was about 5 or 6, this girl, who I am not going to say the name of, would come over basically every day. When parents weren't looking, or we were alone for a bit, she would touch me inappropriately, and had it in my head that sex was a normal and common everyday thing. This ended up with me growing up and believing that sex was everything. As I grew up, relations with family members, cousins, siblings, even parents were breaking. I always viewed everything in a romantic way, causing me to feel awkward around my parents. I never opened up to them, and I don't know why.

In my early ten years, like, 11 or 12, I got into middle school, meaning that we could actually see each other for the first time in years. Not only would she tell her friends about the stuff that happened years ago, but she would also pin it on me, making me look like a total fucking creep in front of some of my friends. I just recently found out that the way I am around people could be a result of what she did to me, taking my innocence at a young age. She took so much from me, and I can't get it back. I hope she dies a horrible death along with her friends who support her. Now, I discovered just a few days ago, that I may have nostalgic depression. I get really said when I think of times when I had my innocence, and wasn't to set on sex all the time. What do I do?

For anybody wondering, she is now doing drugs and sucking random peoples' cocks at age 14 on the streets."

Pretty sure I'm Neuro divergent so I've been the weirdo all my life. Anxiety will not let me live. People make fun of me, they all treat me in an ableist way and I've been called a retard a couple times. I live with depression now. Nobody cares for me at least for real. I live alone. I'm an immigrant and I'm alone in this country. Everyone has always made fun of me, even my own family and I always wanted to be left alone. Now I'm facing the consequences. I'm gay and I have to live with that too. I have endured abuse from a previous partner. Now I just eat when I'm alone. I gained 30 pounds in record time. I tried joining the gym and I just injured myself. I'm so bad at managing money now I'm in debt. I don't believe in myself enough to get a better job or perform well in it. Someone fucking help me save my life."
96,Cold,"""I look towards my peers, and their words are cold. And so I put on my jacket
I look towards my teachers their voices are cold. And so I put on my boots 
I look towards my siblings, and their hearts are cold. And so I put on my coat
I look towards my mom and her gaze is cold. And so I put on my hat
I look toward the world, and I see it is cold. And so I put on my scarf
Hopefully when I walk outside I won't get buried in the frigid temperatures"" 

I thought of the time I was in elementary school and ran with it."
97,The thing about depression…,"The thing about deep depression is that you literally can’t help yourself, but people who have never experienced it don’t get that and just think you’re just consciously and purposefully making the decision to screw yourself over. Even mental health professionals do this. They view you as this disgusting person who’s not worth their time and this makes the pain even worse. A lot of the time I wonder whether they have the right to talk about you how they see you or if people just aren’t as kind as they think they are."
98,I wonder why do to even try,"I have been subjected to torture since I was 3 years old, enduring physical abuse from people who weren't even my family, for things that weren't my fault. Then, I had to spend most of my childhood away from my mother, only with my sick step-grandfather. I was at the mercy of adults who made my life miserable, and I was also isolated in school. I never had a girlfriend, but somehow I also suffered from sexual harassment as a teenager. At the same time, I was constantly told that I was hideous. It doesn't even make sense, but whatever. As always, I feel like I am the worst.  
Then, during my youth, I had to shoulder the responsibility of supporting my family and solving their issues, all while battling suicidal thoughts. I managed to get through it, only to be hit by the pandemic. Later, I had to endure conditions like GERD and hernia. Fortunately, nowadays the hernia is gone, and I can eat almost normally despite the GERD.  
However, I feel almost completely alone. Even if something good happens to me, I feel like it doesn't matter because I see myself as a waste of oxygen, someone who is not worthy of love. I feel dirty, pathetic, and everything negative. Yet, despite all of this, I'm still trying to find a reason to keep going. but right now, I just feel so weak. And a doctor told like I'm never going to be well I will always suffer from depression no matter what ...."
99,I’m stuck.,"I don’t want to live anymore. I have a hard time even just getting out of bed to take care of myself and for years I’ve held on thinking that this is bound to change one day, in the next few months or next year, but it hasn’t. I’ve wasted my teenage years away and accomplished nothing. I genuinely don’t want to live anymore but I keep cowering when I attempt to go. I keep thinking about the possibility of it going wrong and living with disability afterwards. I wish there was a simpler, painless and actually peaceful way to go. I wish I had someone to hold my hand through it all."
100,Being single is lonely.,"I have been single for 7 years now and it’s making me sad all the time. I don’t have someone who is taking care of me, someone I can talk to how my days have been, someone to hangout with or cuddle at night. I have been working abroad away from my home country for 5 years now. Living alone and having to take care of everything on your own is depressing. I have few friends here but they are all in a relationship, so most of the time I don’t want to meddle around their quality time. I had few flings but obviously it didn’t last and it’s making me more sad because of the way they are treating me and always receiving breadcrumbs of their efforts.

My previous relationships, I always got cheated on and left alone. Sometimes I blame it on my biological father as he doesn’t had anytime for me (my parents are separated) emotionally and physically. He can’t even fight for me over my stepmom (she hates me) and that’s the reason we stopped talking to each other unless I needed some help financially. I always say “if my own father doesn’t like/want me, what more other people do?” I feel like having a relationship with someone will solve this problem, as I always feel happy whenever I have someone beside me. I feel important and loved even they are just giving the bare minimum. 

A lot of people telling me to find a man who’s mature enough to handle me. But it’s difficult. Easier said than done, right? I’m turning 34 years old this year, single with no kids. Sometimes people are telling me that I’m pretty to be single. Sometimes I’m asking myself that question too. I’m currently based in UAE. Most of the men here were muslims or just after beautiful EU females or just looking for someone to have “fun” with. And neither of that describes me. I’m medium built, fair skin, Asian and came from a 3rd world country that produces a lot of nurses in the world.

Is this normal to feel this way?"
101,"Lost my last friend, I give up","I have already mourned the friendship but I feel like I just cannot connect with people. I am a part of the problem but I honestly can't cope unless I am alone - however I cannot be alone if I want to live. I feel distressed or like I am losing myself when I befriend people. I will always be depressed no matter who is or is not in my life so it is for the best.

Even though I am feeling extra lonely now its not like it would be any better if I made friends. 

Therapy for 15 years, forcing myself to be better for 15 years, meds for 5 years... I give up. This is me. I am meant to be alone and sad. Trying to fight it just makes it harder."
102,I need someone physically right now,"I just want someone to hug me and tell me everything will be OK, I feel alone, although I have friends, I only see them at school and with how our schools schedule is, I only see them half of the time, on top of everything in my life like trauma, stress, and suicidal thoughs, I'm now self harming almost everyday and my grades are at an all time low with an average GPA of around 1.5"
103,"My boyfriend is ""worried"" about my political opinions.","Background: Im 31F and ive been universally hated by my peers my whole life. I honestly dont know what to do to win people over. Ive tried out several personalities over the years. Admittedly, in middle school i discovered anime and therefore tsundare characters and was kinda mean but i stopped that by 9th grade. Im overweight but not morbidly. About 170 and 5'4 with 36DDs. I have a meh but not completely tragic face. I have always tried to be the funny one...i and my family speak a lot in movie quotes and sarcasm. We also try to seem as intelligent as possible and do tend to know a lot of random facts. 
Ive been in a relationship with 38M for 13 years...and he is on the opposite political spectrum as me. I dont mind this and i love to debate but he will not argue anything with me in person and acts as if he agrees but then weeks later will blow up on me. He will say how my views ""worry him"" like im a god-dang supervillian but he never brings any evidence to his side to convince me. He just tells me im wrong and makes me more sure of how little the world thinks of me and my opinions. I spend a lot of time on tiktok and anytime i send him any video remotely political he yells at me. He says if i send him something then i agree 100% with anything the creator says. So, i stopped sending him tiktoks online and instead would show them in person where i could explain nuance. That worked until a couple days ago when he went off over feelings on my views he had been holding back. Now, i wont show him any at all and frankly im terrified to voice any opinion to him for fear of his disapproval.  I dont know what to do anymore. Obviously im the common denominator in all this hatred of me but ive run out of ideas to make myself likeable. Even by my boyfriend of 13 effing years. 

Ftr im an independant and he is a democrat. I have no crazy exclusive OR inclusive views. Im fairly freaking neutral.

Also: yes ive been dating and not married for 13 years. We dont even live together, i live with my parents and he lives in the rotting shell of his parents previous home."
104,"Why am I so unhappy, even though I have a lot?","Why am I so unhappy, even though I have a lot?

M

Hi everyone. I just wanted to do this post because I just feel lonely and I have no idea why.

To start off with, I’ll try to summarise my life in a paragraph. Growing up I had a horrible dad who never looked after us, he never bought me anything and used to hit me, lock me up and never let me out. I’d get beat if I went outside. Never fed us properly and would leave the country for a long time and we’d see him for like 3 months of the year. He treated my mum terribly wnd cheated on her and he left us when I was 8. I am now mid twenties and I’ve been through a lot since then. I’ve had people dear and close to me steal from me, betray, use me and so on. I don’t want to go too much into detail as to what I’ve been through in case it becomes obvious for the people who may recognise me through this. But it in short words I’ve been through a lot of scenarios, seen a lot of things I shouldn’t have. I’ve seen things happen to my own mum, I’ve seen people close to me almost kill themselves, give in to substance abuse, depression. Ive been treated really badly in relationships in the past, but It is what it is. It just helped me become a stronger man. I’ve looked after people constantly my whole life and after I’ve helped them, most have left. The ones who stayed were my family because at the end of the day, they are my family :). I have a few good friends left bless them, one friend that has been there in my good and bad times since childhood. 

Sorry that’s long ^ but that’s just the absolute tip of the iceberg but I tried to summarise.

Now I’m at a point in life where I’ve overcome everything, I’m very successful god bless. I’m in amazing shape, I’m strong, have decent looks. I have my dream job, I have a beautiful car at a young age, I have my fiancée who’s an angel and we’ve been so happy together the entire time. She is my whole heart. I have my immediate family who are great people. Honestly, couldn’t complain about life, god bless.

But for some reason, I just feel sad most of the time. As loving as everyone is in my life right now, I feel like it’s hard for anyone to understand what’s going on in my head. I do open up don’t get me wrong, and they’re there for me. 

But for some reason I just feel like it’s hard for me to be happy, I feel so ungrateful because I now have everything I could’ve dreamed of, there’s literally people dying in the world from terrible disasters. I have so much more than most of the world.

But I just feel sad, depressed, useless. I don’t know why I feel like this? 
I should be grateful for what I have right? 
Is it because I’m weak? 
I don’t think I am because of everything I’ve overcome, but at the same time (in the most non-suicidal way) I feel like I’d be more at peace just being with god now? 

I don’t know if anyone’s felt like this before, but you just feel tired?? 
Like just genuinely tired. Maybe it’s because it’s been exhausting being there for everyone in my life whilst going through so much sh*T myself. I’ve seen so many things, I saved one of my loved ones from killing themselves, I’ve seen such horrible things, I’ve been dealt such horrible things. But I’ve always powered through it. I’ve been there for a lot of people in my life, and never regretted it one bit. Even though it’s tiring at times, but to this day I still try my best to help everyone around me, And they’re all very grateful for it. Even for the ones who were ungrateful and used me, I do not regret helping them out one bit and never will, and i don’t hold a grudge on them. Because at the end of the day, it was a part of my life journey and I will always want to help everyone I love, family, friends, lovers. 

Maybe it’s just all catching up to me finally? 
Even though I have everything you could possibly have in life, I’m still ever so sad. But I hide it very well from everyone. I don’t know why I’m so sad and depressed, why I feel like not being here. I’ve been in anti-depressants and beta-blockers (for anxiety) in the past.

I’m sorry that this is so long, I don’t even know if this post makes sense. But I thought id get some strangers opinions on why I’m feeling like this, regardless of what I have? 

Maybe it’s just simply depression, or ungratefulness? 

I don’t know, but who ever reads this and responds, I hope you have a nice day and thank you for taking the time to give me your  perception of your world and experiences in life🫶🏾

105,I’m gonna fucking kill myself now,Did I stutter?
106,hey guys i found something that has really helped me in productivity and finding motivation to get me to do anythign,"basically it's just being proud of urself at ANY capacity , cuz if u keep ur expectations so high and unrealistic for how ur feeling, and don't make it a priority to be proud of yourself and celebrate yourself at little wins and victories or not even for victories just for simply existing it, like things can get rly hard rly quick ive noticed for myself. 
its so simple but so effective and u deserve to be proud of urself at any capacity and its seriously so just life changing and so helpful to my mental health in SO many ways i truly have been living by this and everyday feels so much brighter when i make an effort towards giving myself more compassion and appriciation for the ""bare minimum"" but i hate sayign that cuz it really deminishes the actual substance of what ur doing by labeling it so yeah i hope this can help someone somehow :) love ya "

108,"Depression, GAD, OCD, Autism, ADHD - should I have disabled status?","30 YO Male here. I've been suffering from depression (since I was 17 and it hit me the hardest at 23), generalized anxiety disorder (since early teens), OCD (since early teens as well), Autism and ADHD (had it all my life, learned about it a few years ago). I most likely also have PTSD and C-PTSD, although not officialy diagnosed (however my current psychiatrist admits that's it's a norm for people like me).

I've had problems in all life areas pretty much. I barely get out of my bed, I have no energy, can't focus on anything, no willpower, complete anhedonia, I can't stay in good relations with 99.99% of people for long period of time and it's just the tip of the iceberg of my problems. I have tried sooo many different prescribed medicine for my problems, but they all cause side effects, either attacking one or more mental illnesses (SSRIs gave me more depression and made me lose even more focus, but calmed my anxiety, Bupropion worked the other way around, ADHD meds only gave me anxiety) and/or gave me horrible physical side effects, most of the time bad pains in abdomen.

Would you say I qualify for status of a disabled person? Would someone like me with my problems and health issues be able to be granted any help and the status in your country/area of living?"

110,I just want someone that cares,"I’m 15.

 I have been completely alone for 5 years. I am overweight, and unattractive. I have zero friends and am on the verge of ending myself. I am only alive for my mother. That is it. All I want are some fucking cuddles. Just a hug. I feel so fucking hopeless. I don’t go to school, I’m an only child, I have no interests, and I hate where I live. It’s fucking inevitable at this point. I HAVE to do it. There is literally no way out. Nobody will want me, and I don’t deserve anyone anyway."
111,I'm really scared of myself ,"I'm really scared of myself lately, during the day I can't stop thinking of suicide, and at night I have been having the most upsetting nightmares I've ever had in my life, to the point where I try to keep myself from falling asleep. It is so distressing, all my nightmares are very realistic and involve my loved ones dying and my dog who I absolutely adore dying, and I can't stop it from happening. I'm so upset all the time, and I don't even get a break from it in my sleep! I don't know what to do!"
112,I'm really sick right now.(I caught a cold 🤧),"It's been a week my nose's been running and I''ve been coughing. It reminded me old days. I was very weak kid who caught every illnesses as possible as I could.

113,I wanted to know how to deal with loneliness,"I'm very tired of myself, it seems like I have no reason to complain but I'm always complaining in my mind, always looking for unnecessary fights, unnecessary reasons. I can't stand listening to people around me talking, I feel so alone even if I don't like the person, I live in a shared house so it's impossible not to hear and I know it's not their fault, but I can't stand it, my mind is killing myself with things, assumptions, distrust and loneliness, I want to die, but I know that when death knocks on the door I probably won't want it anymore, I feel ungrateful for wanting this but I'm just looking for peace and wherever I go I don't I find this peace."
114,"Should I quit gaming? Clinically Depressed, trying to upright my life.","Games have been a crutch of mine for years. to the point where I was addicted as well. These days I don't mind much enjoyment from many games but when I am away from gaming I don't really have a hobby to keep myself and my hands busy.

Thing is, with gaming I feel like I have something to wake up for, something to work towards.

&#x200B;

Without gaming, i can make progress on life, learn hobbies such as playing the piano(actively doing) but it all rings hollow.

&#x200B;

I just, I don't know what to do. I can't decide. I don't have much social contact so I miss the ease of communication video games brought. 

I enjoy multiplayer games I can play with people that aren't too grindy and just no games seem to bring me joy and I don't have any engaging hobbies I can replace it with.

All my coworkers look down at me pretty much- I know it’s a silly thing but they look at me like I do entry level data work. I have some of the highest education level on my team, not that I think that means anything at all most times, but they talk to me like I’m stupid and make jokes at my expense.

I struggle to find a better job- or even a good job. I have very few friends, I cry and am angry everyday. Like I feel like I’ve let that little kid in me down- the one that swore we would never be like what we saw growing up. Watching people do dumb stuff and have no self respect. Yet here I am.

I got told I needed to do 2 semesters of pre reqs to get into a 60k accelerated nursing program even though I volunteer as a licensed EMT for five years.

Every door I open seems locked - I feel like God hates me. And I wouldn’t blame him if he did. I’ve made so many horrible decisions. I feel so alone. 

I feel completely defeated. "
117,I can’t believe I’m here. Again.,"26F. First time in this sub but I’m pretty familiar with being down. At a point I really had no idea where to turn.

Been working through a lot of things my entire life. When I say that I mean the trauma literally started within the womb (was born with neonatal abstinence syndrome/heroin withdrawal) . And honestly it only got worse from there. But the work I did? God I thought I’d done so well to work through the many many awful events and circumstances. I’ve had comments that I’m surprisingly well adjusted and people shocked I didn’t go off the rails. It’s been a conscious push forward for a long time and at least 15 years analysing myself in depth. Can’t afford therapy but occasionally have talked things through with friends who then passed on what they’d learnt. Point is. There were tough times but I thought it was the past and I really didn’t think I’d be back here. 
But I am. And I know it’s the loneliness and everything that stems from it. Cos of my trauma I find it really hard to attach at all. I have family members that are well. Around. But even the “good” ones (more neutral I feel) are people I just could never feel safe with. So I have relatives but no sense of family or support system there. I have no partner (years of casual dating and either heartbroken over people who just didn’t like me or escaping toxic/abusive partners early on. Thankfully). So all that’s left are friends right? The concept of friendship means the absolute world to me. It’s so important. But once again the attachment issues are real and they don’t fit any sort of pop-psychology attachment theory. It’s just my own shit. And now I feel like my friends are gone or friendships are falling apart. Most people have relocated and slowly the bonds are harder to maintain. Most of my friends also have long term partners they understandably prioritise. It just feels more and more like my relevance in my friends lives is disintegrating. And part of the work I’ve done (and might have done wrong) is to question the instincts that come from the hurt. So rather than self-isolating cos I’m sad that I’m lonely I tend to go towards. I will tell my friends i miss them and make an effort. And the more I make bids for connection the more it seems reinforced that my friends genuinely aren’t bothered about me. None of them are cruel or selfish or anything like that it’s just adult life I think. But my place amongst it all, entirely on my own is destroying me. And I can’t help but question how much of this is my own fault . And is it this inescapable thing i’m subconsciously doing to myself and will continue to repeat? And one of my biggest fears of all is that I’ll end up just like my mother - spiteful and deranged and forsaken by everyone who’s known her, this entirely alone. I know logically it’s likely I’ll meet new people and form new bonds. I just feel like I’m in a ghost town knocking at doors , no one is answering and the road is near its end. Like no one will be important to me again and no one will ever really care or look out for me. God I’m so scared. I need some tenderness. I need a hug. And I need a break from the everyday. But as simple as they are they don’t feel achievable. 
Thank you anyone who read my vent. I just needed to say something somewhere."
118,i got caught crying in class and I feel even more embarrassed and suicidal now,Tears started coming out during one of my classes as I felt very overwhelmed. One of my teachers later pointed it out causing me to start tearing up even more. Now I'm kind of just anxious that other people in my school saw me and I feel really embarrassed now. I don't wanna show up to school tomorrow I feel embarrassed and I feel like a wimp I wanna kill myself so bad.
119,I don’t know what’s going on and what to do everyday of my life.,"This all started in september, 2023. I had been smoking weed for roughly 3 months. On one night i relax myself with an 8 second rip off the pen. 20 minutes later, im in shear panic, feeling like my chest was going to explode, and as if i was going to die. I continued smoking, even though this was pretty traumatic to me. I fell into a pit of depersonalization, brain fog, and anxiety, that eventually led to what i think is depression. I can’t go a second without feeling down or worried about something, but i don’t know what that thing is, it just feels like a constant strain on my brain. Was the weed trying to tell me something? Will it go away if i’m still smoking? I just needed to let this out it’s messing with me."
120,Threw away life,"I don't know what to expect from this post. I should be getting ready for a job interview, get some sleep, but instead I feel like jumping from the 12th floor. It all sucks, I had a good life, stable income, family, friends, but I ruined everything through some bad life decisions. I still have a job, but I am lonely in a foreign country, family is thousands of miles away, and my finances are precarious, I see no future. My old life will never come back, I was privileged, and threw it all away. I cannot blame anyone but myself, and this hurts a lot. Good old times will never come back, I just wish I had a heart attack, at least my family would get some insurance money."
121,I'm drowning,"I'm at a loss for words. I want something to latch on to, to blame, an external thing I can point to and say, ""that's my problem"". But the longer I sit and try to write that thing down, the more evasive it becomes. It's all in my head. There are no words that can adequately describe this feeling, because it's just a feeling. It comes and it goes. I can't just sit and wait for it to pass, I have no choice but to function, so I trudge through and burn myself out completey. I have nothing to show for my efforts, nothing to come home to besides more problems. I want to give up. "

123,Never enough ,"I'm just in a very sad and vulnerable place right now and I just kinda wanna ramble nonsense to get it off my chest. 

I've always felt like I was never enough for anyone. There have been multiple scenarios in my life where I just felt abandoned by someone and it really sucks. From a past partner, to old friends, and even my own father, they all just left me behind despite all the love I still had left to give. At this point I've given up on asking why they left and I'm just trying to focus on healing the huge wounds they left behind. But its starting to get so damn hard to let those wounds heal with depression weighing me down every single damn day of my life. It's getting to the point where I just feel physically numb to every emotion I have and I hate it. I don't want answers about what I did to deserve this, or why does this always happen to me. I don't care about those questions anymore. I just wanna accomplish everything I set out to do and make my family, and most importantly myself, proud.  "

This is ruining my life and yes I’m under well-being I can say I’m doing better but I just don’t feel like it’s enough. I’m freaking out that it may take me years to get a job after uni cause I’ve watched this happen to people, finish uni and jobless a few. Sorry I have high functioning anxiety. I just hope I don’t end up hating myself in 10 years wishing I did more now"

130,My friends have periods of time when they get tired of me and i need help understanding them,"This is about 2-3 people in my life that have a feeling that i purely can't understand and i, asking for help so that i don't feel bad and help them at the same time. My best friend and my boyfriend both have random periods of time when "" they dont want to talk "" to specifically me ( or other periods fixed on someone else). To give better explanation one day one of them wakes up and feels that they dont want to talk to me, kind of like being sick, getting the ""ick"" from me and they'd rather just not talk to me at all. I have asked them both if i do anything to trigger this and they both said no. I am not blaming any pf them for this as they both explained that this is something that they cannot control, but it makes me feel bad when my closest people ignore me. I do not live with any of them, i see my friend almost everyday in my learning facility and my boyfriend 2 times a week. (for context, they have no correlation to each other whatsoever, it's a coincidence they both do this. their periods of "" ignore time"" are not at the same time and nothing is happening that involves them both behind my back, my girl bestfriend is gay)
As i said before im not their only target, both of them get this thing on other random close people. Please help and take into consideration the fact that theyre not assholes and that i know for sure they care, i just want to understand them better."

My relationship with my dad has always been bad since i was a kid. I think it all started when i was in 1st grade elementary. my classmate blamed me when she got hurt. she and her grandma went to my house and told my dad i hurt her which is not true at all (she fell by herself and blamed me for it) my dad didn't even bother to ask my side or ask me if it's true. he apologized to them right away and when they left, my dad grabbed my umbrella and beat me with it. i was trying to tell my side while he was hitting me but he told me to shut up. he didn't stop until my umbrella broke. my mom was out of town thar time and she never knew about it. He always blames me whenever something is missing at home (things, money etc.) he always points his finger to me when something broke at home, always blames me when something happens to my sister. I've been modeling since i was 15 years old but 3 years ago unfortunately my career slowed down (i’m 23 now). i started getting depressed, eating disorder, anxiety...

133,Happiness isn't a genuine emotion,"I always felt that happiness, especially in my context (secondary sexual assault victim, rejection, guilt of not being able to save the person), is a fake ass emotion, not profound but superficial and in all aspects inferior to sorrow and suffering because it is delusional, like in a stockholm syndrome, like you must really be stupid to be in my body and be happy. If I gave my life to someone else and he would be happy, I would really call that hypothetical person stupid and blind and naively optimistic."
134,why do I not do things I want to do?,"I want to get better. I want to get ahead in life. I want to live my life, not just survive. I want to travel. I want to spend time on my hobbies and learn new ones but I just can't seem to bring myself to do any of it. 

Recently, someone asked me to come on a trip with them. Although, I would probably like to go on a trip like that but I can't seem to convince myself to go for it. I would just rather lay on my bed."
135,The future seems so dark to me.,"I don't want to go into my past trauma too much but I feel like a tldr is a bit important for context. I've struggled my whole life with mental health. When I was a child I was kidnapped and abused. When I was 23 I lost my wife and 2 children and took up abusing alcohol and marijuana. I've done everything I could to improve my mental health. I've been sober for 2 years and I've finally found a career for myself. I thought I was doing good. But the aftereffects of my depression have kicked in. When my wife left me and took my children across the country I stopped taking care of myself. I got up to 245 lbs (I'm 189 now...yay) but I stopped brushing my teeth. Now I brush daily but they're slowly withering away. I also couldn't afford to pay ANY bills. Now my credit score is 400, I have 3 cat repossessions on my credit report. I can't get an apartment. I can't get a car. I can't even get a secured credit card. I've become more financially responsible but because of my credit being bad I literally can't do anything anymore. My job is good but I don't make enough to pay cash for everything. I get insurance in a few months but I can't even afford co payments with how expensive dental care is. I can't even go to the doctor without financially ruining myself. The worst part of it all is I am so fucking lonley, I've done so much to better myself but Noone going to want to be with someone with poor credit, poor teeth, and shitty mental health like myself. I've kept so many details out and I spared you all my trauma but I'm starting to get scared. I hospitalized myself to handle my mental health years ago and I've genuinely felt so much better but I feel hopeless right now. I'm afraid of the future. I'm afraid no matter what I do I'm on the path to being alone and homeless. Not because I don't have money but because I don't have credit. I've already lost everything once and it took so long to rebuild. I can't do it again. "
136,I’m extremely depressed but don’t feel sad or angry.,"I don’t know why. I’m not known to be depressed. I don’t even believe in it, but I know I am.

I’ve been modeling since i was 15 years old but 3 years ago unfortunately my career slowed down. i started getting depressed, eating disorder, anxiety… i started isolating myself in my room. i felt lost, i started loosing my passions and interest, i couldn’t understand myself. i was crying day and night. 
I stopped accepting jobs for months because i wasn’t mentally and physically stable at all.
I was always awake at night till the sun rise then sleep in the morning. i was either binge eating or starving myself.
No one in my family ever checked on me. my dad kept on nagging me saying how lazy and how worthless i am. he kept on talking loudly from the kitchen to my mom about me, for me to listen from my room about their conversations. my depression and anxiety became worse and worse. i felt helpless. no one was there for me.
Today my dad had me, my brother and mom talk in the living room because they noticed that my sister is developing depression too. he started talking by saying me and my brother should talk calmly to my little sister and never shout at her and he started blaming me again and really tried to blame my sister’s depression to me. i really wanted to shed tears, my whole body was shaking. then he started talking shit about me again saying why i can’t find job before when in fact i do have 2 regular jobs now. he kept on bringing up how arrogant i am that i look so high of myself that’s why no one wants to hire me ( i sent my cv to so many, did interviews for months but couldn’t find a job since in my country it’s difficult.
I couldn’t help myself anymore, so i started talking back to him and telling my side but i was having anxiety so i started crying while talking and he was so pissed about it. he looked at me like i’m so ridiculous. not even pity. he was gaslighting. i started telling about my depression throughout the years but u know what he said? “oh come on, you’re just lazy and don’t even try to excuse ur laziness by saying you were depressed!”
I was in shock but not too surprised. we kept going and fighting but he just never want to validate my emotions or understand my depression i had for years and he told me to fuck off and go to my room.. so i was like.. yeah that’s it. that’s my last straw.
i went to pack my luggage. not thinking of anything else but just to get out of that house. 
minutes later my mom went to my room and saw me packing. she started talking and saying is this how you hate us? i don’t hate my mom NEVER! but his husband? yes! i was just crying and packing my things my mom started crying. i couldn’t think straight anymore and i just said i think it’s better if i just die. both of you especially dad thinks i’m worthless and all so i better just disappear! me and my mom were crying so hard but my dad was just there.. he couldn’t care less. i told them i’m gonna leave or just disappear and my dad is telling my mom to let me do what i want… 
my siblings stopped me from leaving because of my mom. my mom said if leaving, she wants to leave with me too. i really love my mom and my heart was breaking when i saw her crying.
i don’t know what to do anymore. i feel so hopeless and tired. i don’t know what to do anymore…

142,Idk what's wrong with me ,"Many, if not all of you will call me a privileged prick and I deserve it for this stupid rant. I'm 26 and I'm in a relationship, I grew up in a financially comfortable family with a wonderful mother and father, I was SAed a bunch of times by different family members while I grew up( not immediate family). I was bought up as a strict Catholic after I hit 14-15 I realised I wasn't very religious, not religious at all really. I grew up with no friends I did very good at school and sports but I never had any true friends when I was 17 my sister died due a genetic condition and when I was 18 I left my country and moved to Australia as an international student. Like every other international student I started from the bottom and worked my way up during my degree and a bunch of jobs but my mental health was okay for the most part. I met a Muslim girl at work and we became friends and realized neither of us were religious so we got together. I lost my virginity to her and we fell in love quickly. I trusted her with every aspect of my life but she lied to me from the beginning she lied about her past, she lied about hooking up with a mutual friend(before we got together) that became one of my best friends at work. When I came to realize that she kept that from me I was devastated and then later on I found out that she sent explicit pictures and videos of her prior to them hooking up that he still has in his phone cause she sent it via messenger. I forgave her and stayed with her. We went through a lot of upa and downs and when her family found out about me they made her break up with me. She was my first love and first relationship but we got back together very quickly then when her family tried to set her up with another guy she broke up with me again over text. At that point I hit rock bottom and I tried to kill myself 10-15 seconds before I was going to do it my mum saved my life (unknowingly) she called me just to check up on me and I broke down and told her everything I thought shed be angry that I was with a Muslim girl but she was just there for me. There was a lot of talk about Jesus but still she was there. To reasons I don't understand maybe because I was fucking stupid we got back together again and after we did she cheated on my emotionally with that guy they tried to set her up with. I caught her and she apologized and said she'd do anything to be with me and she made good on that promise. She gave me all her passwords for socials and have been good ever since. 

Skip to now we both moved in she had a huge falling out with her family when she moved in with me. Her sister cut her off. It's been a couple of months and she cooks, cleans, does my laundry does the shopping and does everything that I want her to do, including sexually. I graduated and went into a full time job with good money and has got another job with my dream company at high six figures. My family all thinks I'm successful and I'm happy. The truth is I'm overweight, no confidence pathetic shell of a human being who puts on a show for people, even for her. I don't feel like waking up everyday and I constantly want to just end it. I have taken measures that if I finally do do it all my finances, student loans clothes everything will be sorted. I even have taken care of howy coffin will go back to my home country with no cost to my family. I know I sound like I'm whining and there are people with far more worse problems than me. I just don't know what's wrong with me, right now I don't have a reason to be sad or depressed if that's what this is but I just don't know what to do here. "
143,Short End,Im usually the fix it friend and the therapist for every one in my life. However a month ago I been going through an r-word SA case and after the assault my ptsd got worse. Plus the depression is insane. Im not one to fold but I was seeking help and support from my friends. I give my shirt off my back for them and do so much. I don’t expect anything in return. Yet the second I have this brutal experience all of my friends suddenly don’t have time for me and cant be there for me. I got into a slight argument with my bsf today and she literally said that “your situations are always so hard” and that I don’t help her with hers recently (Her bf and her broke up for the 7th time when I was SAd) she makes no effort and only talks to me when I try to make an effort. Idk I just feel alone and sad. Like I don’t have parents and Im young so it’s scary. Wwyd?? 
144,Why are some days so much easier than others? ,"I’m 20 and have been diagnosed with depression(recently BP2) since 12. I always figured it would get easier to deal with as time went by, and for the most part that’s been true, but I always have this underlying sadness to me and days where I physically cannot get out of bed. 

I’m medicated for bipolar and have been going to therapy for about a month now and it’s helped out a lot with giving me longer and more consistent days of just feeling okay, but I still haven’t felt joy or cheery in sometime now. I have the capability to, the medications haven’t numbed me, it’s just I never feel like I can fully enjoy myself. I remind myself as best as I can that better days are ahead, but for the past few years my “better days” are just days that I can bring myself to get out of bed or the house. Is this just the rest of my life? "
145,I need something to change,"I was diagnosed with cancer 2013. Have had 46 surgeries and in remission but I've done it alone.   My daughter took whatever she wanted because I was going to die anyway.   My home was burglarized five times.  My health still sucks.  Won't go thru all of it because the end result is no doctor can help all due to the chemo.   I feel I've lost everything.  I cannot work, I spent all my savings on medical so I'm broke.   I cannot work.  I'm alone and every time I reach out to anyone they're brutal and mean.   I cannot stand to live anymore.   What's the point of fighting when there's really nothing for me.  I did try to get a pet but that's not working out either.   "
146,"Letting go, Being free","I'm going to let go. It's the struggle that kills. The fight is a circular trap, a moebius strip.

No more battle. It is time to heal. It is time to accept. and, it's time to let go."
147,I'm out ideas,"I'm not sure how to help myself, I was bullied as a kid constantly no matter where I went to escape, I was constantly told ""oh its all jokes"" my whole life and now I never know what truly is or isn't a joke. I would breakdown crying because all of it, and I would just get bullied for that too, I'm tired of not knowing how to help but I don't know because I don't know anybody with the same story who can help."
148,I sabotage myself daily. The few people that ask me to visit maybe once a year always get flaked on because my anxiety and sadness of being in public terrifies me,"A grown ass adult who lives on my own (somehow). I don’t have anyone to hang with, and everyone I know has become an acquaintance through a text message. I don’t get texts or calls anymore because I always cancel plans. I did that to myself for sure. Who would ever come to my funeral or anything for me, if I can’t even spare them 3 hours of coffee or a walk. 

Why can’t I fucking suck it up for 3 hours and act like I’m okay. I keep getting told that it’s depression taking over. How do I even get them to understand that my cancelling has nothing to do with how I prioritize these people (trying to get) in my life 

Someone I knew a long time ago is in town. They are actually a good person. They are here for work so I’ve been in touch.. they are under the impression I’m busy a lot with work so things come up. 

But what doesn’t come up is: 

“I’ve really been meaning to come. I’ve been in tears and depressed about it all day. It’s not you, it’s society. It’s pressure to do ANYTHING outside of my home that involves social interaction.”

people just don’t take it seriously. Why would they? Who wants to ask someone who hang out again, that flaked. I had every intention of trying my best but the only thing that stops these all day attacks is if I say “I can’t
do this anymore today”

I say it because I have to go get under my blanket on the couch instead of the terrifying idea of driving in public, eating in public, and having to carry on a conversation 

I’m tired of it destroying my life and ambitions "
149,It's hard to not to feel like completely giving up most days,"I'm 32, almost 33. with several chronic health conditions. I live with my parents still because I can't afford to live in my own. They still pay for ally food and I don't pay rent soninvery much depends on their support.

I have no degree, not even an associates. I currently work two part time jobs just to try and get by and even then I'm currently sitting overdrafed by $200 in my bank account

I can't afford to go to college because that would take time away from my working, I need to afford my meds but I can't really get a better job without some form of training or degree.

I just feel like I royaly fucked up my life and that there no real good outcome.

I'll be stuck living with my parents until i die from my conditions or they do and I die from lack of resources.

Most days I just feel like a burden to everyone I know and that I'd be doing everyone a favor if I disappeared forever."
150,I’m ready to let go.,"Depression can be likened to an uninvited guest who overstays their welcome, 
casting a gloom over everything and making the home within your mind feel foreign and uncomfortable. 
It's like a thick fog that obscures your vision, making it difficult to see the path ahead or remember the way back.
Depression can also be compared to a heavy anchor, constantly pulling you down no matter how hard you try to swim towards the surface. It's a relentless storm, with thunderous thoughts and showers of sorrow that can feel unending.
It's like being trapped in a maze with no exit, where every turn leads to a dead end. 
It's a shadow that follows you around, even on the brightest days, a constant reminder of the darkness within.
Depression is a silent scream in a crowded room, a plea for help that goes unnoticed. 
It's a war within your own mind, a battle between the desire to fight and the urge to surrender.


I am a burden to everybody in my life. I’m ready to let go of my suffering, and free my loved ones from me. "
151,Trying to reach out after a long episode,"There's been ups and downs of course, but I'm willing to say this current stretch had gone on for years. Years worth of breaking down over nothing. Bursting into tears at random, with no off switch.

Change, moving, loss, obsessing over a pointless job...

I've pushed some people away and just fell out of contact with others in my attempt to just get things back on track, to find a normal that didnt drown me.

Nothing new, to me, but it hurts to finally feel like I'm coming out of it and to be met with radio silence from the people I once cared most about.

The desperation that I feel to try to fix it, overshadowed by the depressing thought that it's better if I dont; that I'm just getting what's coming to me. And knowing I can't fix things if the other side doesn't even care to know me anymore.

Why am I the way I am?"
152,Life after arrest,"I am slowly reaching my life’s end. I hate myself.
 I am a foreign student in the USA and last year I was arrested and charged with fleeing and attempting to elude a police officer (misdemeanor). This was a huge mistake. It was my first time being pulled over in a foreign country, it was about 2am and so dark at night , and I thought American police use a different color of lights. I wasn’t even speeding, but apparently the police officer was so mad that I stopped about 1 minute after he activated his sirens. 
Up till now I have not received any tickets because I’m so law abiding. My case was taken to court and due to the nature of the case. I got a pre trial diversion without having to admit guilt. I did that and the case was restricted.
But I just learned that in America, whenever you get arrested, you are now a criminal with a criminal record, because there is no true “expungement” and I am so devastated. I’ve gone through therapy but it doesn’t work. I tried to kill myself too, but my roommate stopped me.
I hate the fact that one mistake has  labeled me a criminal and I hate myself. 
Please I need advice "

154,I don’t see the point in living or trying 24m,"

""I feel like I'm not worth the love and attention in this world from a potential spouse. I am a shy, unattractive, and unsocial guy who keeps hating himself for everything and can't accept myself no matter what.

Some people say, 'Go lose weight, and you'll feel better.' I did, but it didn't change anything. I focused more on powerlifting, but it resulted in the same thing.

Now, the only thing I do is put myself in more pain for no reason. I don't even want to eat anymore since the hunger pain doesn't affect me.

I also met a girl on Facebook. We talked on the phone for 4 hours straight, and she told me she had a lot of fun talking. But the problem is, days after, I feel like I can't come up with topics to talk about or feel uninteresting. I did ask her out for a date and she did say yes but we have to schedule for a day. But this response cant even make me happy since i always got mistreated or am scared to lose this person aswell by maybe being boring.

To bad i am someone that makes situations worse in my head and cant stop it. Sometimes a lot of things overwhelm and just wanna get out of this life.

155,I don’t want to wait around 50 more years to die naturally ,"I was born with medical issues that are somewhat noticeable to strangers. It makes my skin crawl when I think about it yet it stares at me in the face everyday. I never had friends growing up and was that loner in high school who never spoke to anyone because I felt out of place everywhere I went. Medical science isn’t advanced enough to cure this and although I’ve had many reparative surgeries it’s still there. I’m so angry with my parents for having me and wish I was aborted. It makes me feel hideous and I’m always jealous of other people who are prettier than me. I’m just a waste of a life and worthless. Please if you are having kids do proper testing first and make sure to abort if anomalies are detected. How can I live if I’m not really living to my life’s fullest extent?

i just don’t really know what to do?  "
157,"My life hasn't gotten better in 5 years, it's finally time to give up on it.","As the title says, I've just completely given up on my life. The past five years have been the worst years of my life, with my mom passing just weeks before my high school graduation. From then on, a Domino effect of misfortune events. Had my little brother taken away in a super stressful custody battle against his step-dad (who I had a very abusive history with in the past). Then college starts, which should have been exciting right? It was for a little bit. Then I started getting extremely depressed and suicidal on campus, and I didn't take care of my mental health. That ended up costing me my spot in university, and all of the merit scholarships I accrued during my time at high school. Then I flunked out. Then I had to move and get a job that I honestly didn't really like, living paycheck to paycheck as a shell of my former self. All while dealing with family drama and the fact that I'm just worthless and let so many people down. 

Now, I don't care anymore. I know that things won't get better. I don't care if I'm selfish for thinking this way. I'm not gonna care anymore if caring will always lead to this degree of disappointment, frustration, and anger. Yeah. I'm out of a job now. Yeah, I'm homeless. I'm too far gone. My ambitions aren't worth a single damn, and I couldn't give a single damn right back.

And the worst part is? I don't have the balls to end my own life. I'm a coward who wants to die but is too afraid to die. So you know what? Time for an action plan. At this point, I'm gonna force myself to die through psychological means. That's why I left my job and became homeless. I figured that if I force myself into a state of complete and utter hopelessness, I could then find the courage to end it all. "
158,Life is hard. I’m struggling. ,"I’m 22F. Life is hard and I’m definitely hitting a new kind of low. Like if it were a different category from grief or sadness. It’s more like lost. 

I guess I feel like I have no direction or nothing going for me right now. I just graduated with a math degree and did some math education stuff. I thought grad school was the move but given how much work it is and my mental state, I think I’d probably commit suicide before I finish. I am having difficulty breaking this news to my mentors and team whom i worked with. 

They’ve done so much for me and i would rather dig myself in a hole than tell them I can’t continue on with the whole grad school plan. Its my own fault. I went to a conference and said how I wanted to get my PhD and start in the spring semester, but it didn’t hit me until I got home that I need to spend time with my family. I don’t have a mom and my dad isn’t involved a lot in my life so my sister and newborn niece is all I have. I just want to live with/near them and have be part of the family I always wanted. If I don’t do it now, I don’t think I’ll have the opportunity to do so later.

I can always go back to grad school years later. It’s just the thought of disappointing people who put time, money, and resources into me that hurts. Every time I think about breaking the news I get nauseous and start crying, jumping to these conclusions that I’m a waste of a person. I don’t owe anybody anything, but they deserve an explanation about my change of plans. 

Thanks for listening to my ted talk. Any advice appreciated or none at all. I just needed an outlet on a sub that may have similar feelings. "
159,Useless rant and vent-,"I needed to vent. I hate my life. 
I tried everything. I do everything. 
It’s not enough.

I’ve written in my journal, I do paintings, I do therapy and meds; these things work don’t get me wrong. But, I don’t see a sense in my existence. I am a burden to those around me,
and an embarrassment. 

I can’t look myself in the mirror, I’m on autopilot. My body is disgusting, my face is hideous. I’m gonna be alone for the rest of my life. Nobody cares, in a sense, that’s a relief. I have worked really hard in making myself invisible. As I get more hideous it’s easier. And older. 

I’m waiting for my heart to give out. I know I will not be able to do this any longer. My financial situation is terrible. My job is not going well. I can’t eat properly because groceries are so expensive. 

I’ve been thinking about going back to alcohol and sleeping pills. I’ve worked so hard quitting. I don’t want to do that again. I work out and I’m strong. But it’s not enough. It’s never enough. I also thought about self harm, haven’t done it. 
I have my scars from more than half my life ago.

I feel like I’m back in the 90,s with the rage of extreme thinness being back. I was perfect. Now I’m gross. Tears come out, but I can’t break down, I can’t complain, I can’t show weakness. I have to be strong and happy all the time. I feel my soul is dying. There are many things I love and enjoy. But, everything is becoming to much to bear.

I love seeing beauty, in nature and people. Animals, music, architecture.

I will never experience happiness or love, someone that truly loves me. Who could do that? I’m disgusting. And is that truly the meaning of our existence?

I guess this is just another day in bed. I will get up and work and smile. But I’m waiting for my death. I’m settling all my affairs in order, everything is planned. I’ll pretend. I’ll try. But I’m feeling lost, lonely and without any purpose.

I’ll rant again some other time. Thank you Reddit."
160,I always find away to make myself feel bad again (need advice!),"
I just started softball and I did it last year and I found it really was a good distraction and kept me happy for most of the time specially since I was on a team with my close friends who are extroverts and have a way of bringing a good side out of me I also started therapy so I thought things were looking up 

Then I messed up horribly and did something stupid I missed two days of tryouts because I was overthinking like usual and on the 2nd day I had my first day of  therapy which was important so I didn’t wanna miss it but now I’m on a team where I know nobody at all and I don’t think I wanna stay 

softball itself is fun but my friends were the reason I enjoyed it so much now that they’re not  there it’s boring and lame and I’m not much of friend maker I keep my circle small with people I’ve known for a long time and I know it may sound ignorant but I have no intentions on making friends with just anyone I’m super upset and all my good thoughts are now gone and I feel stuck in a hole again so I don’t know if I should quit  and save myself from being more miserable then I already am or should I stick it out because the varsity coach said If I prove myself, be a leader and show I don’t belong on the other team she could reconsider 

but I feel she’s only saying that to get my hopes up cause I’m not an amazing player so theirs no way she’s gonna do that just for me I feel shes only saying that to make me stay which is working cause it’s making me hesitant on leaving I don’t wanna regret quitting but

I joined so I can feel some type of happiness but now that I can’t I have no motivation to stay and pretend 
 And being there is making me hate myself so much and making me feel bad which I’ve been trying to prevent

What do you think is the best decision in your opinion ?

162,Why do I cope like this.,"Tw; domestic abuse, ptsd and ed.

I've realized something about myself that I only know because my boyfriend brought it to my attention.

This episode was brought on from my (21F) stepfather (M29) pushing me over a dining room table after I asked him to be quiet so I could do schoolwork. I then had to see my mother and him hit each other as I laid there, shaking in shock, and I still don't know how to process how terrible this has been for me.

When I get really depressed, to the point where life has me feeling battered, I will bask in my pain. Alone. I will wallow in it, and cry into my pillow until I can't anymore, and I can't eat because my heart hurts so much, and when I sleep I'll sleep all day, until my heart stops pounding and I can't stop shaking. The last time this happened, I was 19, and had lost 40 pounds because I didn't eat regularly for three months.

I know that I do *this.* And it's unhealthy. I know that. 

What I didn't know was that I push people away. 

I told my boyfriend (20M) of four years that I didn't want to come to his house tonight because I just don't want him to see me like this. 

He got upset, and we fought, and he said when I push him away he gets angry. 

Why do I cope like this."
163,Always want to wreck but ,"I, like a lot of people w suicidal ideations, always prey on never making it to my destination. I am in constant hope every time I get behind the wheel that I will fall asleep, run off the road, have to swerve for whatever reason, get t boned, etc you get the picture. I want to die but I'd prefer it to be an accident by any standard. I about did. I came around the corner, I drive reckless when alone, I was going a good 65 in a 55 on back roads and the truck that had turned prior to me ahead of me that was a good bit in front was just around the curve slamming on brakes ie I slammed on brakes and as the TUNDRA bold font on the back of this truck got bigger and bigger I wanted to ease off and just slam into it. Fortunately I did not, I braked then I cried the last . 25 mile to my house. At the time a song was playing that made me think of when my daughters mother and I got together and I just wanted to let go because that's what I have to do to get over the idea of having my family back. 


Long story short, I'm relieved but also very stressed. Maybe this is a bout of hope maybe it's just drunken rambling"

165,"Struggle sometimes getting unnaturally obsessed with things outside of my world, e.g situations in the news or even ridiculous stuff e.g. something that happened in a book/show, anyone else do this?","Is this part of depression or autism, or I am just nuts?

At the moment it is a news story from my country, a couple of deaths that I can't seem to get over.  I didn't know these people, but I google every hour for updates, I research as much as I can, and I just can't help feeling so overwhelmingly sad about it.  Pit of the stomach, gutting sadness.  My brain starts running down fantasy paths of how it could have been prevented.  I can't let it go, can't help thinking of the future they could have had, the loss to their friends and family and all that life ripped away.

It just becomes an overwhelming obsession :(

Sometimes it happens over stuff that is fictional e.g. a book or movie where something awful happens and I just obsessively ruminate for days/weeks!  I avoid all sad movies because of this.  Anything with relationship stuff, I cannot watch.  I know that I will be stuck in a morbid state of mind for such a long time after.  Like a misery hangover, that it isn't worth subjecting myself to.

What is happening?  and does this happen to you guys?"

If you're somebody who was never shown real love as a child, and you've never known it as an adult, all you know is people treating you like garbage, like you don't matter... how are you supposed to love yourself? How are you supposed to show yourself what love is when you don't even know what it looks like?"

He insists that I have to do his group therapy now. Individual therapy with someone else isn't enough. I said no, I'm not comfortable with that.

I didn't pack a particular pair of pants (packed a similar pair by mistake) and have been hysterical about it since. 

I can no longer enjoy music, tv shows, movies or exercise. 

I can no longer feel any sexual pleasure (can't feel anything in my penis) and have no desire to do any activities I once enjoyed. 

I've been sitting at home all day, mostly crying and moping over the pants. 

It has taken over my life and I'm not sure when if ever it'll get better. 

I used to be able to enjoy drinking 6-8 beers a day but since the pants I can only drink 1-2 at a time. 

I also struggle with keeping my place clean and doing laundry.

172,A book that has helped me in some way,"I have been feeling like shit for the last 3 years and got to the point where I decided to feel better just because of the constant suffering I cannot endure anymore, and one of the books that really helped me is ""The upward spiral"" by Alex Corb. The reason it has heled me so much is just pure logic. 
I have been chasing luck and happiness my whole life and it has led me nowhere (or worse) so I switched my beliefs to something i was chasing before my rough path-simple logic. 

The book offers a detailed explanation of how your brain works on depression- with all the components and signals that we produce and process- included of making depression what it is and what it's mad eof, and it gave me hope of some kind of explanation that I am feeling this way not because of me, but because I have trained my brain that way. So if I have already trained my brain to feel like shit, I have got to find a way to do the opposite. And some of the materials and techniques have really stayed with me since i have read it and still use it today.
I hope at least some of you find it useful and i wish luck to you all."

Yes I send them memes and they do the same thing as well but we don't really talk much. This year I'm starting college again but the classes are online so I won't have much of a social interaction. I was diagnosed with avoidant personality disorder and I feel really lonely I wish I could meet new friends or get a boyfriend (I've never have one) but I don't go to clubs and stuff, I just stay at home because I lack energy and I'm not in the mood, I'm afraid I won't ever be on a relationship or I will end up really lonely and I'll be unhappy. Is it normal that I feel this way?"

176,Trying to regain something lost or to realize its too late.,"Forgive me for the title, it probably took me about 3 hours to think up that silly line since I wasn't quite sure how to start this off though its probably it has always been easier for me not to think of how to start things but just to get into action as soon as possible.  For a brief intro I am a 39 (m) and I could probably talk about my life and traumas though that alone might exceed the limitations of this post alone its safe to assume at least I have experienced and witness throughout the life might be equal, more or less  to what others on this reddit might have experienced the only difference being it was myself who went through them and more or less my choices after those events and how I lived my life is the only difference.  Anyhow the only thing I will clarify when I was younger I had anger management issues, was insanely competitive in any aspect of life and always sought to be better than everyone else.  (perhaps why I got into games later in life)  Part of why I changed was an event where I did something to my baby brother that ended up breaking apart my family, the injury was blamed on my mother's long time boyfriend (this is an entire mess I won't get into since that my mother's burden and I at least have grown enough that I don't have to bear her sin as well as mine.)  This caused myself, my little brother and baby brother to go into state custody and I will leave that to rest but only add it was these events that led me to make the choices I did in my life. 

Before Christmas the company I had work for holds a Christmas party a week before and since I always attend I attended like every other year but something broke within me that night and I haven't been able to repair what broke.  Previously at any other event I am a very social person, being involved in the conversations and adding to them at times but that night I was quiet didn't eat anything and only drank two beers before the party wrapped up.  It was such a startling change in myself that even the big boss asked my boss what was up and was concerned since it was a huge departure from the person I am usually.  Safe to assume my time at work has been sporadic now since that party and I can't seem to fix what broke within me and not sure if I want it fixed anymore.  It pains me knowing the people at my work are hoping I get better and at times I think its better for them to let me go.

What I couldn't tell them was that at the party it struck me that I am tired, in my life I never formed any deep connection with another person and I had gotten tired of always walking away from forming anything with another person.  I am tired of people saying I am a catch despite everything I have done to make myself appear less attractive to people.  I am tired of people asking me of my hobbies since I don't have any and tired of saying that I just do what strikes my fancy at the time.  Tired of seeing people better than me dying alone knowing if they had the opportunity they could have done so much more.  Tired of wondering how much longer I have to endure knowing there is no end in sight only knowing that I have to grit my teeth and keep trudging on because what else is there.

Sorry for the post not sure why I posted, I do have a therapist and I been pretty open with her and been in therapy for around 9 years.  I think in the end I was tired of hiding it from a public venue and this is at least public in its own right."

I’m a virgin (and I can’t see this changing anytime soon)ugly, broke can’t drive a university dropout just a genuine mess of a human being. I’ve been this way from being a child. I’ve never seriously self harmed but I remember being very young grabbing the knife from the kitchen and trying to plunge it into my stomach but it was too blunt to go through. Everyday is just the same as the least working my menial minimum wage job I’ve never felt love and don’t believe I ever will. I can’t ever see there being a light at the end of the tunnel and things changing for the better. Every night the only thoughts going through my head is who would actually care if I passed and there really isn’t anyone who would give a shit after a week tbh. I don’t think I’m suicidal but I genuinely just can’t see the point of existing"
179,How do I convince my tomorrow self to actualize my bright ideas when I'm drunk,"By bright ideas, which are actually normal for others and absolutely frustrating for me, I mean things like finding a new therapist, since I've moved to another city.
And fuck you if you tell me to stop drinking cause you clearly have no idea of what actual depression feels like. And fuck you even more if you think that you do know what actual depression feels like and you've been through it but still want to give me such an ignorant answer as to stop drinking or start going to the gym or it all starts with a small step or any of that shit.

I'm already used to changing my wallpaper to a big red text reminder of what I've got to do in the upcoming days. So it doesn't really work anymore.
I thought of a lot of things to remind me(or rather convince me to do the right thing). Like drawing a huge cross on my hand as a reminder, or even puting my whole hand in a bucket of paint for that matter, but then I would wake up the day after and think to myself I was drunk and uplifted for a little while, but in actuality I'm depressed and I can't go denying that, so it's okay for me to not do the things that I have to do. I realize that it's a toxic mentality, but that's me, as long as I can remember I've been like that. 
I doubt I'd get any answers that would satisfy my broken mind, but I would still greatly appreciate it as long as it doesn't have any of that over optimistic bullshit. But I'm mostly posting this as a deceleration that I need a psychologist's help so that it would lessen my excuses tomorrow for avoiding the subject. Still, would love to hear your thoughts on this..."
180,I'm stuck,"I'm only trying to not self destruct because of my mum. she has a lot going on even without me making it harder for her, so I try to avoid engaging in self destructive behaviours because I don't want to be more of a burden for her than I already am but I swear if it wasn't for her I'd probably be drinking myself to death or using. I'm so done. I have no clue what I'm doing with my life, I should be out of her house already (I'm 23), I'm not in uni and I'm not working (can't handle a job for more than two weeks lol), I'm only an economic burden, I have really few friends and it feels like I can't even talk to them because they already have their own issues to deal with, my OCD is out of hand and I can't even do basic tasks (shower etc). I wish I could just say 'fuck it' and act out on my impulses. I don't even want help, I just wish I could self sabotage but I can't if I don't want to hurt others. I'm stuck in the middle.

I’ve gotten help through hospitals and treatment. hospitals ultimately made things worse with my depression and definitely created trauma on top of trauma, but treatment facilities as in residential did help. 

I have a boyfriend now and i still am going strong with my best friend, so i can’t leave them again to go back to treatment. i’m scared i will lose them like i almost lost my best friend.

184,Immobilized By My Depression,"My depression and anxiety have always been a battle for me but I always have found a way to pull myself back up (sometimes faster than others) However, these past few weeks, months, years for that matter.. every time I get myself back on my feet I have a good stride of being me again then out of the blue life hits me with another bullet and I fall again. 

This time when I fell, I didn’t want to get back up. I am getting to a point where I feel like life has finally broken me. Why not just stay down so it doesn’t hurt so bad when it happens again?

Today has been the worst I have ever been depressed. I can barely think, move, talk. I just feel like a vessel of who I once was. And for the first time I’m scared that the person I was has finally wasted away. Now I just take up space and concern the people around me. I wish I was okay so they didn’t have to deal with it. I wish I could just hold this pain to myself but I do want to live my life like everyone else, I want to be excited for things. I honestly feel like I’m wasting away as life passes me by. I am only 28. I still have time but why don’t I look forward to it? And will I ever? If so how? I know it’s not an easy fix which just makes me feel more stuck and like a lost cause.."

190,Depression coming back with a vengeance after moving apartments,"For the past year I've been living with my sister in a huge apartment, which has been good because it was sooo spacious, but we fought a lot and I found myself becoming more and more depressed from the constant negativity that I was responsible for. For months I haven't read any books, made much art or done anything that made good use of the space. I réalised that it would be best if I moved out while still being close with her. 

But now I'm gone and I'm waking up crying, my eyelids are burning from the constant tears. I keep thinking of my room there, her pet rabbits, and even the awful dead animal smell from my neighbour that permeated the apartment and I just want to give up on everything. I haven't felt this bad for ages and everything feels hopeless. Yeah I wasn't doing much before but now I'm actively feeling awful. I look so dishevelled and have fully stopped taking care of myself because of the stress of moving. I saw a picture of myself from a week ago and I look so awful. 

I should have réalised that changing my environment does little but upset my sister and uproot her life. I feel this great sense of having betrayed her and I wish I could take it all back. My heart feels like its been broken into a million pieces and I don't know how to fix it. Only I could take a beautiful thing ( living with family and pets) and uproot it and turn it into crying on a bare mattress in my new room with all my stuff in boxes around me."
191,I'm new here,Hello. i wanna join to a group of ppl who experience the same situation as mine..
192,Update ,"Once again, I find myself lost. I try to better myself; play with my strengths, and let those strengths embody me as a person. 

I must be doing something wrong. I feel at peace with myself, yet the other half still feels lonely. Some side of me still wishes to be with someone and be with someone forever. 

I try to connect with countless people and open up to them. They end up opening up to me and see me as someone they can talk to, but I can't return the same feeling towards them.

As I speak to them, only lies come out of my mouth. Covering up my truths as I fear being judged no matter who I am speaking with. I know it's wrong, yet I simply can't stop... I truly can't 

I only smile and laugh as others talk to me. I try not to let my pain be seen. How long can I keep up with this persona?"
193,Navigating mental health as a student,"In the bustling hallways and the silent corners of the library, where the air is thick with the scent of books and caffeine, there's a story unfolding that often goes unnoticed. It's a story that many of us share but seldom speak about. Today, I want to break that silence and share my journey through the often turbulent waters of student life and mental health. My story is not unique, but it is mine, and it's about time it was told.  
I am a 21-year-old woman who, like many others, embarked on the exciting yet daunting journey of higher education with dreams in my eyes and hope in my heart. What I didn't expect, however, was for those dreams to be clouded by an uninvited guest: mental health struggles.  
As exams loomed and deadlines approached, what started as mere stress evolved into something far more insidious. Sleepless nights spent staring at the ceiling, pages of notes blurring before tear-filled eyes, and an overwhelming sense of isolation became my new normal. Anxiety and depression, two terms I had heard but never truly understood, became my constant companions.  
The university, a place I had thought would be a haven of support and understanding, seemed indifferent to my struggles. Resources were either scarce or stretched too thin, and the few times I mustered the courage to seek help, I was met with long waiting lists and generic advice. I felt lost, alone, and misunderstood.  
But in the darkest of times, I found a flicker of hope in the digital world. Online forums, mental health apps, and virtual therapy became my sanctuary. It was through these platforms that I found not only coping mechanisms but a community of individuals who shared my experiences. They offered not just empathy but practical advice and resources that I could access anytime, anywhere.  
This digital lifeline was a game-changer for me. Slowly, I began to find my footing again. I learned mindfulness techniques to manage my anxiety, found online study groups that helped alleviate the loneliness, and engaged in virtual counseling sessions that offered the support I so desperately needed.  
My journey through the maze of mental health and academia taught me valuable lessons, not just about resilience and self-care, but about the importance of accessible support for students. It's a cause I've now dedicated myself to, advocating for better mental health resources on campus and raising awareness about the digital tools that can make a difference.  
I share my story not for sympathy, but to shed light on an issue that affects countless students. It's a call to action for universities to prioritize mental health as much as academic achievement. It's also a message of hope to those who are struggling in silence—you are not alone, and there is help available.  
As I continue my journey, both as a student and an advocate for mental health, I am reminded of the power of sharing our stories. It's through these narratives that we can break down the stigma, build understanding, and foster a community where no one has to navigate their darkest moments alone.  
To anyone reading this who sees themselves in my story, know that your feelings are valid, your experiences are real, and there is a path to healing. Together, we can create a change, making mental health support not just an option but a fundamental part of the student experience.  
In sharing my story, I hope to inspire others to speak out, seek help, and support one another. Let's make mental health a priority, not just during exams, but throughout our entire educational journey."
194,Am i depressed again?,"i (14 f) have had experience with extreme clinical depression before (december - april? 2023) and i have also tried therapy because i had issues with my mom but i found that it was too expensive and it never actually helped how i felt it just was somewhere to say what i was feeling. i stopped therapy one day and never went back, i was also never prescribed any type of medication. i also have social anxiety (undiagnosed) but it has just always been apart of me its not really new. When i had depression before, i just fell straight into it and it was like walking right off a cliff one day i had no warning symptoms. I also had an addiction to SH and slowly became sober (1 year 1 month now.) i have been feeling so physically tired that i almost cant hold up my head anymore or even have the energy to say ""never mind"" when someone asks me to repeat myself. i was very happy about a couple weeks before this and i constantly kept my room clean. i am now procrastinating cleaning my room (something i used to enjoy very much) am too tired to do anything but sit in my bed, and as soon as i come home from school i sit down and scroll on instagram until i go to sleep. i have also been very very irritable and i cry over little things that dont matter. i have a subtle voice telling me that my friends think im rude/annoying/bitchy etc, and i dont know if im actually depressed or just feeling this way for one reason or another. i also am way too scared to ask my parents to see a doctor because my mom always brushes it off and says im being dramatic or she usually says she will get me an appointment and literally has never done that and will never. please give advice or lmk if you think i could have depression.

195,How to deal with a lot of things going wrong at once?,"So I just want to apologise in advance for what is essentially a rant into the ether. Especially considering I do already have a therapist I zoom once a week. 

During the second half of last year, my partner of multiple years decided to end the relationship. She is self-diagnosed autistic and is/was experiencing autistic burnout due to pressures and stressors outside of our relationship, and despite my best efforts, she didn’t allow me to be of support to her in these areas of her life. We were living together and for all intents and purposes planning a life together. It all felt quite abrupt as only weeks/months before she ended it, she was consistently telling me how happy she was to have found me and how she only ever dreamed of a love like we had. 

I did plead with her (I didn’t quite beg even though I wanted to) to seriously consider her decision and that ending our relationship didn’t have to be the only way, I was happy to give her space to breathe and think if she needed it.

She said she just felt so blank due to the burnout that she couldn’t see any other way but to end it. 

It was absolutely crushing to me. I moved out of our place, the lease ended not long after and obviously we didn’t renew it. I’m living in a studio that belongs to extended relatives (paying them rent), and am constantly applying to rentals but having no luck.

I’m a freelancer but since the break up I’ve struggled to keep up with work and have had to dip into my savings to keep up with bills, etc. 

I’ve lived here less than four months and my relatives initially said I was welcome here until I found the right place. However very recently they started to ask why/how I haven’t been approved for anywhere thus far. (They’re wealthy boomers who own multiple properties and haven’t rented since the ‘80s) I explained there’s a rental crisis, competition is quite insane and some places are signing applicants before they even advertise inspections. (For clarity, I’m applying for places my current salary would more than easily cover and I still have decent savings despite dipping into them, so I’m not an undesirable prospective tenant). 

To make things more difficult, my relationship with my mother who I was for the most part always quite close with, since about 2022 has just absolutely deteriorated. I’m not quite sure what’s caused it but it was like overnight she just snapped and is a shell of her former self. She gets irritable even during a five minute phone conversation, when I have barely spoken to her. She’ll become verbally abusive and when confronted with the language she’s used, will immediately deny it and gaslight me. 

I can’t work out if this due to menopause (she’s in her mid 50s), unresolved trauma or just a combination of a lot of things but losing my mother as a source of emotional support these last couple of years has been harrowing. 

I know I have a lot be grateful for but also living with mental illness (depression, anxiety, cptsd and eating disorder) I feel like I can’t keep up with it all. 

Constantly applying for properties and never hearing back is just beyond depressing, living in a property owned by people who deep down suspect I’m just not trying hard enough to leave is weighing on me. I’m still grieving a relationship that ended so suddenly and abruptly and mourning a future I will never now know, and having to distance myself from my own mother who in the past would have been a rock for me during a time like this. 

I feel like nothing but a failure and although I don’t feel actively s****dal, I can’t see any kind of future for myself or that I deserve one. 

I just feel like I’m absolutely not coping and many of the aspects of my life that would have served as pillars of support previously are no longer in place.

196,On my attempt,"On TV, they show that when the mind enters into a coma, it's like being concious and dreaming at the same time but what it really is like is different. You have a dream but when you wake up, you forget it immediately and it leaves just a darkness where memories are supposed to be. Simular to how sensitive documents have been marked to conceal certain information. It's a surreal feeling that I wish I could get rid of. It's the feeling of not being sure if you are still in one or not. You then have this constant urge to take a gamble to end it all to see if you are still in one but at the same time are afraid that if you aren't in one, you made a grave mistake. That urge gets bigger every moment i think about it. it's been on my mind alot. There's this feeling of indifference towards others feelings and it's getting hard to pretend that i care when i don't. Im tired. I'm so tired. Is this a side effect of almost dying? There's that urge again."
197,I don’t want to be alive anymore.,I hate myself too much to stay alive. I shouldn’t be alive anymore. I’m so pathetic I hope I die in my sleep tonight.
198,im not meant to be alive,"all i’ve ever done was be a bother to the people around me. I’ve been physically and mentally sick for years, people have thought i’ve gotten better but i still feel the same pain and turmoil. having to go to the hospital to get iv treatment is useless, i will never be the same. i had to drop out of college because im too weak to even go to school. ive lost all of my friends, im not social like i used to be and im awkward and mentally incompetent. sometimes i think that many people just aren’t meant to be on this earth, and im one of them. i think im going to kill myself tonight, theres not other way to get out of this. life is like hell, it never gets any better."

201,How bad is hitting myself in the head,"Ice cubes are not working for me anymore. I just used an open palm to hit myself on the top of the head twice, and that helped for a few minutes, but it gave me a headache.

203,How can i separate my feelings from studying ,I feel so depressed but i feel more when i can't focus or study what can I do 
204,I feel hopeless,"Buckle up this is a long post, but I’d appreciate the read and some feedback or even just some kind words. 

I’m 21, suffered from severe depression and anxiety since middle school, & I’ve dropped out of college twice. Almost as soon as I finally enrolled in esthetician school and had some hope for my life (I’ve wanted to be a makeup artist since I was a kid), my health starts acting up. I’ve had random health problems since I was a kid but they’ve always been pretty manageable, my mental health was always more debilitating. 
However, a month into my 6 month program, my health started taking a steady decline, I’ve missed so much school due to bad days and doc appointments and we’re still not sure what’s going on or found anything to help manage it. I’ve lost 10 pounds in a month (I’ve been the same weight since freshman year of high school), got diagnosed with central sleep apnea, which is just fantastic cause now I have another thing to be anxious about and there’s no way to help me being exhausted all the time rn, I think I have insomnia which doesn’t help at all, and now I’m about 2 months behind in school. 
I can’t just graduate anyways, I have to make up those hours so now I’m stuck here longer and dealing with everything. My class days are 9am-5:30pm every single day and I’m suffering. I’ve already taken a few weeks health break & being behind is making me anxious to go to class which is making me miss more and then the cycle repeats, & my grad date gets pushed farther back. 
I’ve talked with my school in depth and shown doctor notes and gotten only minimal accommodations, I don’t want to drop out but I’m at an all time low in my physical and mental health. I just don’t know what to do. Everything feels pointless bc I always get kicked back down once I’ve gained some hope for my life and happiness. On top of it, I moved to a new city for this school and have no friends and know no one but my sister, I’m an introvert but my mental health is getting in the way of even wanting to go out or attempt to meet people so even though I’m content by myself, I’m getting so lonely and becoming a miserable vegetable. 
I thought I had a rough freshman year of college, but this is 100x worse and I’m drowning. I hate everyday, and I’m just so so… sad. I can’t stand it. 
So yea that’s it, sorry if u made it this far, I just needed to tell someone because no one in my family or friends can understand what I’m going through. 
(Also if u read this & think u know who this is, no u don’t, ignore this please lmao)"
205,Trouble Waking Up,"It's getting harder and harder to get out of bed. My dreams before my alarm are so vivid. And I'm always surrounded by people. People that seem to like me. I hit snooze 2-3 times and between each is a new dream and a new set of friends or family members.

Then eventually I have to drag myself out of bed. Get ready to work, where I sit in a cubicle alone all day. I've lost half my motivation to work so now I'm anxious that I don't do enough. I try to put some work in, but in the end I'm a lazy pos. I make careless mistakes when I try, and I am pretty sure I am going to be disciplined on one today. I have no one to talk to or even message on the phone. 

Then I come home, where I'm still largely alone, as my SO is asleep. I take care of the animals and am beyond grateful to have them. But goodness I wish I had people like I do in my dreams. "
206,I hate night time,"I feel like I do okay all day, maybe even feel like I’m doing better. Then night comes and I’m laying in my bed wishing I was asleep but I can’t slow my thoughts for even a second. Every depressive impulse I’ve ever had comes right back as soon as I’m in bed for the night"
207,Tornado year.  Need to vent. ,"March 2023: found out I was pregnant with our “ours baby”. We have 4 other kids, combined. (Me two boys and him 2 girls) The youngest being 10 at the time. I waso verwhelmed by the idea of starting over. 

Over the next few weeks I had complications and after several doctor’s appointments and screenings I was told that I miscarried.

 I had terrible hemorrhaging that hid her heartbeat from view. At my last appointment they sent me to am the hospital for an ultrasound to decide if I needed a DNC. The tech found a heartbeat. I hadn’t miscarried  but they were not confident that it was a viable pregnancy. Nobody knew but me and my husband. 

April- my boy’s biological father was murdered by his wife’s affair. Shot in the back of the head when he came home from work early. 
We had just closed on a house and were in the middle of moving when this happened. My boys spent 12 weeks going to therapy. It was a difficult difficult time. 

We spent the summer going to therapy, drs appointments, and renovating the house. We had to wait nearly 4 months along to tell them about the baby because I couldn’t bear to let them lose someone else. 

I am a muralist and painted 9 of them in 2023. My biggest I had waited months to start because of payment delays with the city. 

The house we bought was a  flipper. We started showing in October. Balancing the turmoil, pregnancy, and real estate doing the holidays was very hard. We had family staying with us for several weeks during that time.  

We barely made it through Thanksgiving and I finally, at 8 months pregnant, was able to start the final and largest mural. I desperately needed to because we were having financial issues with everything going on. I painted for 2 days and went into early labor. 

My daughter was born at 36 weeks via emergency C-section; thankfully very healthy. 

Newborn life and Christmas. Everyone I worked with had pretty much ghosted me when I was unable to fulfill their needs during this time. Life went silent. 

I’m now 3 months postpartum and haven’t been able to get back to the mural and it’s bothering me so much that it sits unfinished. I homeschool everyone and my husband works full time. 

The kiddos are ask doing amazingly well … I just feel so overwhelmed, burnt out, and alone. I have maybe two friends other than my husband but we haven’t been close in years so I don’t feel like I can talk to them about this.

 I know this isn’t eloquently written… I just needed to vent. Thanks for reading. "
208,I feel so alone,"I'm (15m) surrounded by loving people, family and friends, I go to the gym, I'm the best I've ever been physically, I have a girlfriend who cares for me, I have everything I want currently.
But I can't help but feel empty, like there's a missing part in me, I always want more.
I don't know why, but I just break down crying some nights uncontrollably, I cant help it and I don't know how to cope.
Why do I feel like this, why do I feel so alone despite being surrounded by people."
209,Im cooked,"Today i see my crush with another boy. He kissed in her lips. Now im empty inside. I just wanna feel true love but this maybe imposible to me. My face ugly, my nose, eyes, voice, hair its ugly asf. No one knows that i have a big heart filled with love. And worst part is that no one GIVES A SHIT about your mental health or other problems. Every night im dream about me and her (that never happens anyway). When i see a happy couple it makes me think. Why i cant have this feeling?. (Sorry my english is shitty as well)"
210,I go to sleep every night with the last thought on my mind being that I hope I die in my sleep.,"I can't fucking take this anymore, but I'm too much of a pussy to actually end my life, so I just go to sleep hoping I won't wake up like the little bitch that I am. I can't fucking take it. I want out so bad, but I know I'll never be able to do anything about it."
211,How do you seek help?,"Just the title. 

I am a 36-year-old man with a great wife who has been struggling for a while. I don't know where to start. I have two degrees and I have no idea who I should contact to start the process of getting better. I feel like I should know what my next steps are. I have no insurance. My last job closed/is moving. I'm waiting until March 15 to start a new job in the same industry. It seems to me like I should be alright. Things aren't terrible.

Except for the complete lack of motivation and the loss of my interests. Sometimes I go on autopilot to ""enjoy"" a game for a while, but it only passes the time. I want to sleep almost always. Just woke up for the day? Time to sleep some more. Nothing you want to watch? Just a little nap. 

My wife doesn't seem to understand either. I don't think she has experienced something like this. I feel like my feelings don't matter most of the time. I will always choose what others want to do because my opinion is the least important. I've always felt unimportant. Not like I wanted to be important, but the absence of feeling like anyone cares what I think or want. I don't know if I have trauma, but the ACE questionnaire thinks I do. Where do I go? Who do I ask to talk to? The last 2 times I asked my primary doctor about therapists/psychiatrists I was sent to counselors. I didn't feel like they were equipped to do more than ask how I was feeling.

Help."
212,exhausting shit,"i feel like shit, its not like my life is terrible or anything, its just that these small things keep making me feel like i want to die, first of all being gay and having a homophobic family AND living in a homophobic country is doing wonders for my mentally ill self, and i dont know what i want to do with my future, it might sound dumb since im still young but i have no fucking idea, not even a sliver, and my sister got a cat and dumped all of the responsibilities on me, the cat is sick right now and my parents said they have no money which also is stressing me out since i need to neuter her and vaccinate her too, so how am i supposed to do that? for fucks sake, also i feel as if everyone around me is right and im wrong, i live in a religious enviorment and i act religious so i dont get punished (its illegal to convert to being a athiest or any other religion) and it feels like im lying to everybody every second, and also thats made be have trust issues, since i came out to my family and well, lets just say their reactions made me want to kill myself, and i bottle up all my emotions, who the hell in their right mind wouldnt report me to the police if i told them about how mentally ill i am and how im gay? i wish i could just die sometimes, ,when im stressed  i start scratching my wrist until it bleeds, i dont really want to be alive anymore, i want to escape my family and my country or even escape myself, i want to be alone forever no family no friends no nothing,  i want to feel that calmness i feel as if im in another world, away from everything and everyone, i just want a calm life, but perhaps its too much to ask for isnt it? ive wondered if i should kill myself right now or wait until im 18, so i can see if i can actually escape from my nightmarish life, and if i cant ill just die, if i could go back in time id tell my younger self to just go die, to stop being scared and just jump, im so tired."
213,Success with medication ,"Has anyone had success finding a medication that works well for them? And how do you know it’s ~what’s~ helping. I’ve tried so many and im currently on 150mg of lithium carbonate but I feel like I’ve just accepted that this is how I am (not that it’s good) but I would like things to be different. 
"
214,I’ve had constant cycles of depression for 6/7 years now ,"I’m 19 now and have had many times where I’ve felt dissociated from society and the people around me. Many moments where I feel almost numb but still have a blunt feeling in my chest. Constant thoughts and panics about the past or the future.

I feel it’s managed to become less and less frequent as I’ve moved out of my parents place to go to uni, but I had a bout of depression recently where I started to question whether my friends actually liked me, whether I’m good enough, etc, all the stuff to do with anxiety. That anxiety made me just complain about life and how shit it is when in reality it’s pretty neutral. I started to associate negative feelings with all the experiences in my life and that was actually causing a lot of harm. 

But since then, I’ve been trying to actively think about the present moment. Generally I’m in my head constantly thinking about the worst case scenarios and stuff but recently I’ve tried to just think like, “look at those trees, they’re actually really beautiful” and stuff like that. Just trying to put a positive spin on stuff.

It did help me feel happier in general but I still feel like it’s almost a piece of me to be depressed. Like, I’m out of my comfort zone and feel like I’m not me when I’m not depressed. "
215,Not able to cry,I used to cry easily before but for past few months I am not able to cry even when I want to...sometimes I need an external stimulant to cry..I watch a emotional movie scene to cry now. I don't understand what is happening.
216,I should be getting better,"I (21F) should be getting better. But this morning I’ve hit a low I haven’t hit in a long time. I feel like I have no where to turn. Usually I could go and cry to my partner and get it all out, but I don’t think I can anymore. Last time I did (I don’t do it often, maybe once every two months or so) he told me in a polite way to either fix the problems or stop coming to him and crying about it. And maybe I misunderstood, but that’s what I took it all. I feel like I’m on eggshells with him the last few days because he can clearly tell somethings wrong, but I refuse to talk with him about it. I’m tired of putting it on him all the time.
I’m tired of existing, I think. I haven’t felt this worthless and like an utter nuisance in a long time. I feel like others around me would be better off if I vanished. I’m not suicidal, but I’m wondering how better everyone would be if I wasn’t around. Like I just pooped one day. 
I don’t know. 
Just needed to spill my guts somewhere. 
Just need reinforcement I’m not alone in this feeling, maybe that will help me feel a little less invisible. "
217,Supporting my partner,"My partner of two years has been extremely depressed for his entire adult life, basically. 

He got on Zoloft last summer and that was great at first but he's going through a really bad spell right now. His therapist said it wasn't the time to increase the dosage, but this time of year has historical ly been awful for him. He knows he'll get through it but it's been several weeks of this now. He's been sleeping a ton and describes the feeling he's having as ""hollow."" 

I do my best to help support him - making sure he eats, laundry, being there for him with cuddles and an open door to talk, etc but he's not opening up to me and I'm feeling really distant from him and like I don't know what to do. It's heartbreaking to see him like this, does anyone have any advice?"
218,How to finally stick to a routine?,"So basically I need to get down my uni work or I will never be amount to anything but I can't keep my ass to a seat.

  
I want to do so much with my life but it's just so difficult. I know what I need to do but I can't bring myself to actually do it. I'm always stuck in a loop of procrastinating and hating myself and feeling guilty. Getting a weekly planner worked at first. I was almost excited for it, I got a pretty one that I could customize. It felt like it was the answer to everything! Then I realised that no matter how much I want to write down stuff, I simply don't have the mental capacity to actually do it. And it was a huge let down.

  
I feel like it's been going on for so long now. I'm always trying to start routines and failing. It's frustrating and disheartening. I want to feel like I'm in control of my own life, but it just feels like my body and mind are against me. I wish I could blame this on anything but myself, but it's all on me. It's all in my head and there is no explanation. I'm just a lazy idiot.

  
What can I do? What can I try that will really work and won't feel like a huge chore and won't leave me feeling miserable because I have to constantly put up with a reminder of my failure? I want to go back to being a functional human. I want to go back to living without self loathing. Why am I like this? Why is this so difficult?"

220,I'm not enjoying shit,"So recently my lover told me if we want to do anything my grades in uni should be good and so I tried really hard for this semester and I failed by 0.2 so she told me that I need to get my grade back up and I should wait till the next semester it's kind of a big deal cuz my only hope for finding a job is studies 
Now I'm hesitated cuz I can't have her while she is in front of my eyes and one more fail and I'm gonna be out of uni I don't know what to do and I have no motivation to continue"
221,my room is filthy but I don't care,"Im 18, and I have 2 rooms technically, because of divorce. My other room is a basement closet and I'm rarely there so it's not as bad. But my room I'm in right now is horrible.

It's filled with dead bugs/mice, I'm laying on a mattress on the floor with no sheets as I type this. I can't even see my floor because of all the dirty laundry, half eaten food, garbage, and used pads everywhere.

There's blood everywhere from cutting myself, holes in the walls from me punching them in anger, and maggots eating away at fast food I forgot to eat months ago. It smells so bad my mom gags when she walks past it.

Yet, I live here, day in, day out. This is where my life is. I can't clean it. Every time I lift my arms, they sag back down. And every time I DO try to clean it, I find more bugs, and I hate bugs so I give up and cry and kick and break things.

Why am I like this....? Why? I'm supposed to be the perfect Pretty clean girl.. if anyone found out I lived like this, they'd leave me. I just want to become one with the garbage and rot forever. "
222,Can't even cry anymore ,"Use to cry all the time when I felted lonely and shitty, then it was kinda just when it got really bad, then it was just bad all the time and I cried when I got overwhelmed.

I feel like I want to cry, it hurts so bad still everyday, I can't sleep again I'm tired of laying here for hours in the dark, but i can't cry.

It hurts so much I'm on the verge of that feeling like my ribs are caving in on my lungs and heart, and it hurt the more I hug my pillow, but I still can't fucking cry.

Why can't I just get murdered or ran over or die in a crash already?"
223,Intense Waves of Utter Despair-Can Anyone Help?,"Reaching out here because I am struggling with experiencing these intense waves of utter despair and feelings of complete hopelessness and darkness and could use any encouragement or advice or acknowledgement. Really, anything at this point. I will even take insults. I am feeling like a complete and total failure at everything in life and irredeemably worthless.

If you look at me on the outside, you will see someone who seems to have everything together. I am privileged to have a decent full-time remote job with decent benefits, a house, a spouse, and a kid who is doing well in school. But it is all a facade. An illusion. On the inside, I am a complete wreck and have been for a long time. I have 0 friends, literally 0. I am not close to anyone in my family and have no real support system other than myself. And I have had a series of events unfold in the last couple of months that have put me over the edge.

1) My spouse announced that she was unhappy in the marriage and has been for years and wants to separate and possibly divorce. She does not want to try any counseling. We have had some struggles over the past few years, but this shocked me to the core. I had no idea that she was so unhappy with me and had been for so long. It seems that I was completely oblivious to an entire layer and series of indirect communication about her unhappiness.

2) Up until now, my work has largely been tasks that I could do on my own with minimal social interaction beyond email, messaging, or the occasional off-camera virtual meeting. I had a routine that I followed every day. This worked very well for me, as I have always struggled with social interaction and chaotic work environments. Now, my job is evolving to require more on-camera virtual meetings that I will need to lead, more on-camera coordination and interaction with larger groups of people, more randomly scheduled sporadic (and pointless) virtual meetings, and fewer of the independent tasks that I prefer and enjoy doing.

3) Even though many of my colleagues scattered around the country (US) have worked successfully in full-time remote positions for years, my employer has joined the ""Return to Office"" bandwagon to improve ""collaboration"" and ""culture"" and is mandating that all employees come into the nearest office soon. Two-hour commute for me each way to a building in a notoriously bad and dangerous area with an open floorplan, exceedingly bright lights, and very poor noise abatement. All to ""collaborate"" with my colleagues (none in my location) via Zoom/Teams.

4) My whole life, I have had an intense interest in numbers. As a kid, I used to spend hours at the library poring over population statistics, sports statistics, any statistics I could get my hands on. Numbers make sense to me. They are unambiguous. They have clear rules. There are no hidden meanings or ""reading between the lines"" or emotional component. They do not require social interaction. The number is the number. 

I have also had an intense interest in technology, particularly computers. I remember spending hours on Usenet and using NCSA Mosaic (showing my age here) to explore the Internet. In high school and college, my free time was spent in computer labs. As I got older, I started to collect older computers and loved to spend time tinkering and repairing them and creating elaborate spreadsheets detailing all the technical specifications. And that became my passion and my escape and the one place where I could experience some degree of joy. I started buying older computers to work on. I had it in my head that I would eventually repair and resell some of them and hold on to some of the more vintage ones for a longer term and resell them for a profit. And then I bought more. And more. And I would dutifully record the technical specifications in my spreadsheet. And then rinse and repeat. It reached the point where I had the large part of a room filled with computers. They were all neatly organized and cataloged. But there were a lot. As I look it at now objectively, I realize that I went overboard and that I spent far too much money on it. 

The thing is is that I never really noticed the spending on computers. As the numbers guy, I have been the one to handle all the finances in our household since the beginning. But I did not track our spending at that level of detail. Every month, we were maxing out our retirement savings, paying our mortgage (including an extra principal payment to pay it off faster), paying all our bills, paying our credit card balances in full, and not incurring any new debt. We had money for travel and for emergencies. Our net worth kept increasing year to year. It looked like we were doing fine. But without the spending on computers, we would have been saving a lot more. 
I have been going through the transactions over the last few years and am recording all the spending on computers, and it has made me sick to my stomach. I do not have a final amount, but it will be a lot. And I feel like a complete idiot and total failure for all the spending that I did. And I know that once I have a final figure and share it with my spouse, she will likely be livid and the already remote chance of salvaging our seemingly doomed marriage will be obliterated.

So as I write this, I am feeling completely despondent, humiliated, and am in a really dark place. I have failed everyone and can't see anything to look forward to. I have even had fleeting thoughts of travelling all the way out to San Francisco to pay a visit to the Golden Gate Bridge, but now that they have implemented 2-Step verification (deterrent net), that option is less viable. Sorry, a feeble attempt at some gallows humor. I am safe.

Sorry that this is so long. Thank you for reading this, and I welcome anything anyone can offer. I could really use it right now. Thank you."
224,I'm thinking of offing myself because no one would really care if I was gone,"If I killed myself, I'm pretty sure no one would give a shit. I would be one of those ""we never saw the signs"" people even though I'm very open about my struggles no one gives a shit. 

When I was suicidal no one gave a shit because I went to therapy and ""got better"" even though I haven't. I'm just tired of being ignored and neglected by everyone. 

I just don't want to be here anymore."
225,Has anyone else experienced this?,"This is hard to explain... but basically I developed anxiety and depression for no reason when I was 11. And yes, seemingly no reason genuinely. Not a reason that's not good enough or repressed memories, ACTUALLY no reason. I used to be energetic, social, and happy before that. It literally came out of nowhere when nothing could have triggered; nothing changed. Besides that, I know it isn't a brilliant way to cope but sometimes I browse depression memes that give certain incentives like ""I had my pain behind a smile every day"" and ""I only live as to not hurt my friends or family""... which I don't relate to at all. But the main point of this post is this: I've been depressed for almost 9 years and I never tried to get better or fight it. People say they've tried coping, yet I never did and went to sewerslide. Even at the start of it, I just immediantly went to that. I didn't listen to therapy, meds didn't seem to help (okay that may not have been my fault but still). I didn't want an alternative solution, I had no aspirations besides death, and... well, yeah. I wish I understood what made me so utterly hopeless at such a young age and so adamant on it without any willingness to cope better. "

227, there anything I can do to help (Suicide risk),"Recently a girl I used to know in high school has been posting concerning content on her Instagram, talking in strange broken English about all the damage she has caused and how she’ll do what she must. A few people in the comments have expressed concern from her. I DM’d her asking if she needed someone to talk to, and pleading with her to reach out to someone if all is not well. She ended up deleting the post. This was on Saturday.

Just two hours ago she posted a blank picture with the caption “Soon I will do it. It’s been going on too long. Just in a facility right now where I am unable to but trying to get out so I can carry on the deed”. 

She hasn’t replied to my message (I didn’t expect her to, we have never known each other well). I don’t know what to do. I had doubts before but it’s pretty clear now what she’s talking about. I know she has a sister, and I just found her Instagram account. Should I reach out to her? We are in the Greater Toronto Area. Should I contact CAMH about a potential suicide risk? Or is this not my place? I just feel like something needs to be done. Thank you and sorry if this post I s against the rules."
228,lost in life,im 13 and have no future or purpose. i have absolutely no friends and nobody cares about me. i miss being groomed because it was the only time someone actually cared about me but my parent uses me being groomed against me and calls me a whore lol. while everyone my age is in school and thinking about their future im sleeping all day and have the IQ of a third grader. i was taken out of school in 3rd grade by my parent to do “ homeschool” but she took me out of homeschool after a month for no reason and hadn’t enrolled me in any type of school or socialized me at all until 6th grade where she put me back in public school and i was there for about a month and a half but i only went maybe a week because my social anxiety was so bad because i hadn’t been socialized and i was so behind they didn’t know what to do with me. i was taken out because they threatened to take my parent to court because i had missed basically a month of school and i haven’t done any school work since and she wont let me back in homeschool and doesn’t gaf about me at all. i sleep all day and i feel like i have nothing to do but kms. 
229,High and drunk to be happy ,"Started out the day fine, in college doing well and then I get home and bring the dog for a walk. Then it hailstones down and go to the local pub that let's dogs in for cover. Well I get hammered because I drink toouch, meet a friend and get stoned as well. Now out getting food whilst the parents are probably questioning what the fuck is wrong with me.

I just feel ultimately defeated whats the fucking point anymore."
230,My decent into self hatred and recognizing mental disorders: 'THE mask we wear.',"First off, I'm not suicidal*. 

I used to attempt suicide in many ways and after my 16th attempt (2020) I realized self preservation wants me to survive against my own will, possibly due to a unrealistic superego. Every attempt failed and honestly baffles me I'm physically unharmed after alcoholism, drugs, dithenhydramine abuse, but while it should be praised I beat every addiction cold turkey just further pisses me off.

My depression peaked  in 2021 when a family member was abusing his daughters, and when confronted,  blamed me. Thankfully that coward killed himself,  but made me realize with the fbi, distrust and that he abandoned his kids  , fled to Oklahoma and killed himself going 113mph into a building. Before that, I was constantly attacked, defamed and treated like a monster. I still don't know why they blamed me, but after the fact, the fbi contacted me, returned my belongings and instead of a apology,  was told because I didn't kill myself,  I wasn't the suspect? My reputation was ruined and caused discontent in my household.  

The fact the fbi treated me like a monster broke something in me mentally and basically left me comatose in bed for 2 years. Before all that, he was honestly really nice and inviting.  I'm more pissed no one defended me and no one denied the possibility,  the family moved away after his death but refuses to contact me or apologize. 

Now, add everything else, being a army vet with ptsd and jobless for 10 years. This caused another issue. My self confidence was destroyed.  I basically became a inactive and unmotivated shell and honestly I blame myself for not being more confident and fearing the worst; so don't see a incentive to try. I chalked it down as me being weak and not seeing the point in self happiness. 

Back in 2023, I realized my behavior changed and noticed manic episodes I saw as me being excited and happy to engage with others, to being extremely depressed and basically becoming a jackass to myself, stating I don't deserve to be happy as no one gives a crap about personal struggles. I realized I was showing textbook examples of manic depression and ptsd from the 2 years I was locked in my room. 

I learned how my brain works by having people point out my maniac episodes.  The first major depression episode was staying up for 7 days and I didn't think I deserved to rest.  The 2nd episodes resulted in me going on crusades and mass reporting pedophiles to the point my friends begged me to stop; I assume due to my experience with those cockroaches, I felt personally attacked and went on what my friends call 'doing a batman.' My family had to basically get rid of my internet and was told by people I was doing nothing if not destroying myself in a fruitless crusade.  When I finally stopped, I was so defeated I planned to run away and never return. Thankfully my friends noticed the essessive anger i felt and told me to stop for my sanity.

Last manic episodes started appearing in 4-72 hours bursts of confidence,  only to utterly destroy me mentally and emotionally.   They seem to be getting worse and I started showing OCD with grooming,  hair plucking and staring into space for hours at a time.  It honestly scares me when I go manic as I have no short-term memories and started having worrying  symptoms of dementia and memory of things 5-30 seconds before slipping my mind or basically going autopilot with my actions.  I greatly blame my abuse of antihistamines,  as dith basically disables parts of your brain in massive dosages. (Went from 200mgs for sleep to 900mgs in a week.) I noticed the issues and believe it's drug induced psychosis.  I can quit, but since the army and 2020 It became my way to 'turning off' my brain so I didn't go full manic and get rest. It's a issue but making efforts to quit( the recreational use isn't the goal, I just want to be out cold so I can stop thinking for once


My main desire is to find a job, but with no work experience,  my manic episodes being very obvious,  and lack of confidence and self respect,  I never even get a callback interview. The other is more existenalism and my inner monolog being able to make me unaware of who I am anymore.  A job I was interviewed for a week ago basically told me I lacked confidence in general and didn't seem to have a drive to be happy.  All I could do was agree and left; breaking down in my car until I went home. 

I am an veteran,  but don't have the confidence in it actually helping as when I went to a VA therapist in the military (Osan AFB) I realized they were not wanting to help me, but told me I was a threat to others, highly intelligent (I'm not.) And I'd never change due to not having trust in the people I work for.( it was hell as almost everyone was sociopathic or grew numb and callus. ) I also had a alcohol problem that basically resulted in me being kicked out for alcoholism and depression.  My alcoholism was soo bad, I would carry soju (60%) in my canteen. Not proud, but honestly would be dead without it att. The last thing I asked my platoon sgt when I got on my plane was,
""Was I at least a good soldier?"" Followed by him commanding me to get on and don't look back. That always hurt me as I was a star soldier and battle buddy to everyone. I was blindsided by the discontent he showed,  as if anger.

Sorry, probably manic atm.

My issue is I honestly Hate myself,  don't know who I am anymore (as a person), and realized I never had friends,  but people who used me and my family,  using me as a scapegoat.  I have hobbies and even a indie game developer (self taught) but only did it so I could have a mark left on the world before I killed myself *(past tense).
I ended up getting a sizable community,  but the pressure for perfection and it going unrewarded or recognized outside it being a passion project it was not beneficial to me who is basically homeless and has no income. I feel like I can't do anything worth a job,  have stills that don't translate to civilian work and basically treated like I don't  even want a job or some work comp scammer.

I have no self respect and noticed my mental issues are gradually getting worse. I have a supportive mom, but my father,  my siblings and inlaws basically treat me like I'm sociopathic, makes excuses and use my parents for free boarding. It sucks being 33yo without a job. It really,  really sucks and honestly makes me shut down mentally while I just 'go thru the motions of existing. '

I don't have insurance,  money,  support or a therapist as no job = no money. My father treats me like a disappointment,  never let's me talk and actively makes it obvious he doesn't want his son around ( he thinks I purposely got out-of the military,  and doesn't believe anything I tell him. )

I just wanted to vent, I'm tired of my manic depression and with the dementia symptoms I basically have a identity crisis and basically blame myself for not being a normal adult with a life.

Thanks for letting me vent. Hope you guys feel better,  as you still can make a change.

231,Am I making a mistake or is it just a phase?,"In 4 days I will move to a new place for my studies. I am gonna be in a completely new environment.  New people, new everything. This is not something that I haven't done before. I have. But something or someone inside keeps telling me I am making a huge mistake and I will be miserable there. Desperate to be clear.

I have OCD—a mild one. I have taken meds for neurological issues before. I have to repeat the treatment once in a year. Death is always on my mind. The only reason death is just a thought, not an appealing action to be taken because of my sister. We have already lost our mother tragically and I don't want her to suffer more. I don't. Are these issues the reason for my current mental state? idk.

She is really supportive of this decision. She has friends, a boyfriend and a career. I have almost nothing. All of my friends are elsewhere. I have been living abroad since I was 17. Normally, I should be feeling normal. But I don't. I don't know what's wrong with me. Starting over is never easy, I know that but I also should feel okay about it. 

Am I a drama queen? Or a bad person who is not grateful or my inner voice is telling me the most important advice of my life? 

All of your criticism, comments, and thoughts are welcome.

Thank you for reading this."
232,Need help,I'm feeling suicidal. I really need help getting through this. I feel very alone. Can someone please talk to me? 
233,maintaining friendships is so hard,"someone recently told me that i am ungrateful and entitled to the kindness people give to me. and they werent wrong, i hate that the most about myself. they said i always focus on the negative and that i cant step back to appreciate the good that people bring into my life.

and i know their criticisms are fair. it fucking sucks being friends with someone who seems to always be in their head and always looking on the downside of things. and it just sucks bc i cant help it. at all. im sure a normal person would be able to appreciate the good things in their life and to take the time to give back to those who give to you, but im not normal. i get stuck on my past and i talk myself down. i cant thank bc it just comes out as guilt bc i dont deserve it at all. 

but how do u even explain that without it just sounding like some excuse to dismiss my own behavior. like trust me.. i know how horrible of a person i am. i am the person who hates myself the most after all. 

idk its just hard having to navigate the negativity that i innately live in while still trying to appreciate ~the little things~ in life. i know being friends with someone who is just chronically sad isnt easy. and i cant expect people to understand me bc its very irrational. but … for things that come easy to people, its just such an obstacle for me. "
234,wanting to stop the meds,"I really don't like how they make me feel, I know that beneath all the layers and bones I am still shattered and all these pills do is numb everything to the point that it feels as if it has been forced upon me.. I am not happy and I don't want my body to fabricate the illusion that I feel normal. I can barely cry and it's not the same, none of this feels like how it did when I wasn't taking anything. I know that inside I'm still in pain, I feel sad but I cannot feel sad in the same ways I could before. The dejected, miserable feeling of heartbreak that you can feel as if someone struck you in the chest.. I guess it was all I had and now what is there? I want to break down and feel real tears streaming down my face but they will not come. What's the point of getting better if it means trading everything that made me feel alive for some idealized sense of numbness. I just want to fucking cry, I want to hurt, I don't want to feel good if this is what that means."
235,i don’t know what happiness is anymore,i’m not sure if it’s even real. it feels like i’m just patiently waiting for my destined demise
236,Why does life suck so bad,"I am going through a lot but also nothing. I had a pretty bad expierence with a roomate that led to her and her friends harrasing me and even led to them vandalizing my door. I have moved buildings but I am still in pieces. Everytime I hear a door open I thinking someone is coming into my room to hurt me. I should be ok by now but its so hard everything is ahrd. I feel like I am not even upset about the situation anymore  but I cant get back to normal. I had to drop a class and I have no motivation to do anything. I am doing everything you are suppose to do, I go to counseling, drink water, take my meds, go on walks but nothing help. I have reached out to people but no one understands the severity of it. I have never had panic attack in my life and have now started having them frequently. I feel like there is no light at the end of the tunnel. If oyu have been in this situation how did you get through it?"
237,no one ,I was trying to talk about my sadness and other things to one of my siblings and they completely shut me out. Basically told me that I wasn’t their therapist. I understand it maybe it’s hard to hear but I just needed someone to talk too. I usually talk to myself to make myself feel better. But I wish I had someone to talk about it
238,How to beat depression fatigue and brain fog,"Hello all !

I've had depression for a while now (officially diagnosed) and i take meds for it. It really helped with unwanted thoughts and spiraling but there's one thing it didn't help with and it's kinda hard to live with that : fatigue and brain fog. Even tho i'm often in a neutral or good mood, I'm constantly SO exhausted, i often have to fight to stay awake at work and when i'm on a day off i can have a full 8h night, take two 3 or 4h nap in the day then have a full 8h night again. Sleeping is actually almost my only activity on the weekends and it's really depressing cause i wanna do stuff but im just so tired. With that there is big brain fog most of the time.
I was wondering if any of y'all had any advice on that ? We ruled out physical causes with my GP (blood tests, IRM, scanner... we did all lmao).
How do you deal with being tired, i just don't want to be sleepy all the time anymore. Energy drinks help a bit but it's so bad for health i don't want to rely on that. 
Thanks for your help ❤️

239,Why does a series of bad events whenever I’m trying so hard to get ahead in life? Feeling so down,"So it all started when I wanted to upgrade my house last year. We live in a very small house with mold issues. Honestly I have been sad and embarrassed about the condition of our house. Spoke to my husband about potentially selling to upgrade to a bigger house. He told me we won’t be able to afford it with 1 income (his) and my part time job. So determined to achieve this goal, I went to look for full time work. After 2 months, I landed a full time job. 2 weeks in I founded the job extremely hard. Commute 2-3 hours daily really took a toll on me. Not long after getting the job, I had to bring my son a long to work and on my way to work a seat belt camera took a photo of my son not wearing his seatbelt properly. 4 demerit points and $1161. Still determined to not give up, kept going and ended up finding a house we like. After losing out on the offer, agent called to say the other pulled out and it’s ours. During the build and inspection we found out that original buyer pullled out because the house has so many things wrong with it. This prompted us to pulled out. So disappointed, we kept looking and losing out on another house. Decided we are just going to knock down rebuild now. After months of being excited and 1 week before signing contract, just found out today that my husband lost his job. Is this the universe trying to prevent me to get a house? Why is it when I try so hard to better myself, a million things go wrong? It’s making me so depressed. I just wanted to vent and if anyone has any similar story that has a valuable lesson. "
240,I’m 13 and I hate living,"I’m so angry. I get angry at people I love and people who don’t even try to piss me off, irritate me so much. I’m so mad at god or the universe or whoever is up there. I just don’t get why I had to be born ugly, lonely, insecure, unlikeable, depressed etc. like I’m not good at ANYTHING. I get average grades, I’m not good at sports, I used to be really good at art and now I can’t even do that anymore. I used to think I was so pretty, because that’s what my parents told me. And now I spend so many hours overthinking my appearance and begging to be pretty. I feel like I look like a man without makeup and it makes me feel so detached from myself. I feel like I’ll never be able to enjoy myself or have fun again again because I’m so worried about how I look. It’s not fair. And my sister is so naturally pretty, so confident and what am I? What do I get? I have friends but 90% probably wouldn’t even be upset if they never saw me again. I’m no one’s go to. I used to work so hard to look like I’m fine and that idc but tbh I’m done. Idc it’s not like my friends will try to help me. There’s this girl in my friend group who seems kinda sad and she stopped talking as much and everyone tries to talk to her, ask if she’s ok.. but me? No. Have they ever wondered if I’m ok? It’s like I don’t count as a person. Honestly I wanna die. There are a few people who care though. My friend I’ve known since birth, my family. I might kms if i didn’t want to make them upset. I’m just so lost. I feel like I’m wasting my life."
241,Am i the problem?,"i have had a rough life, ever since i was a child. I got groomed alot and molested. i was clueless but i understood everything growing up. I had 7 exes which might seem alot and make me look like a whore. but trust me they were all shitty towards me. some ended up cheating, some ended up getting bored of me. Now I have a boyfriend, he was sweet and funny at first but now i quite of lost interest ever since he started to get mad at me and call me names like bitch and whatever you could think of. that is not the main point. I have some severe attachment issues and i start to self harm whenever i have horrible thoughts. My parents knew about it before and blamed me for getting 'influenced' by my friends who were with me and helped me more than them. i cant leave him because he always says hes gonna kill himself if i ever do, and he is mentally ill and i dont wanna be some fucking freak who is a cause of his death. Now ive been trying to figure out what to do with my life since all i wanna do is get the childhood i never had BUT im an adult now.  thank you for ruining my life."
242,Psychiatrist refused to see me,I moved to a different state. The new psychiatrist I was setup with wanted me to fill out 9 page questionnaire. I wasn't able to. Told the receptionist it was simply just too much. Then she checked with the psychiatrist. Because I wasn't able to fill out the paperwork the doctor refused to see me. What are my options from here? 
243,My Mom thinks Anti-Depresants make me a Lab Rat,"1. Hi 19m here diagnosed with Mayjor Depressive Disorder(severe), Anxiety(moderate), and ADD/ADHD. I recently started taking Wellbutrin an SNRI to help with both ADHD and depression, but faced some side effects (trouble to sleep), and my mom went on an massive tirade yelling at my psychiatrist saying things like how meds make me a lab rat because they aren't guaranteed to work, and how ""if i'm lazy, or don't get up and do something that's not something a pill can fix, and it needs to come from inside.""Personally Wellbutrin has helped me out a ton, but my mom is threating to not cover the meds from her insurance, and my current pyschatrist probably does not want to see me anymore after getting cussed out for 15 minutes straight. What do i do reddit?

TLDR: My old fashioned mom thinks ""the depression is just in my head"", and I need to ""be more motivated"" to overcome my adhd and depression :)"
244,Everybody loves me but nobody loves me.,"I don’t feel like anybody truly likes me, i feel so replaceable, I don’t think if i was gone much would change, I don’t think I’m special. It’s so easy for somebody to say “oh I love that person and this person” without truly meaning it. The lady in my life always told me how much she loved this person and that person, but never me, I genuinely never felt like I mattered and i haven’t for a long time, she left me for some guy in another city, basically ghosted me, and acts like nothing happened when we talk in person, she acts like she never knew me.

I have genuinely never felt so lost and empty in my life than I have in the past few months, I feel as if nobody really loves me and I am incredibly replaceable.  I haven’t quite figured out why I feel like this, which has led to some incredible guilt, i guess a multitude of reasons have me like this but I’m not sure. Everyday I try, I try my best to make people laugh, i always try to put on a smile even though I’m miserable inside.

246,Mental health days?,"So I’m a full time college student and I wanted to get an outside opinion on this. 

Is it ok for me to skip classes and take like one day off every week or two to have a mental health day? I’m pretty good and on top of all my class work and I’ve only done this like twice. Is it ok for me to skip classes every now and then so I can just catch my breath from being so overwhelmed by the world?

247,No reason to exist...,"I feel like I've become a parasite on earth. I don't do anything except waking up, eating, watching tv, going to sleep. 
I am 34M and can count on my hands how many times I had sex. My last ""relationship"" ended 14 years ago. I was with her (33F now) for 3 years and we were both virgins. We broke up because we realized that we were just friends and none of us actually had romantic feelings for the other one. 
We remained best friends till today and we had ""buddy sex"" a couple of times 9 or 10 years ago. 
She and her sister are my only friends.
I work from home, so I don't have where to meet new people, so I just go at her place and chill when we have free time. In the past couple of years, I started to have feelings for her sister (25F now). We have perfect chemistry, she told me that she never felt so attracted, comfortable and so connected with any guy before. But, (there is always a but...) she can't be with me because I was with her sister... And, I have no idea how to arouse a woman or make her want me sexually anymore...

Every time I have something great happening in my life, it just crumbles and makes me feel worse than before. 

My mom moved back the last 2 years, so I live in an apartment with my mom... 
I never left my town and never left my parents house...
I feel that I am just an NPC in everyones life and I don't have my own life.

I'm 34 and still feel exactly as I did when I was 20, so I just wasted 14 years of my life and now I feel it's too late for me do do anything. 
Thought about moving out and starting a new life, but I don't have the courage and I get panic attacks just thinking of moving. I don't want to make my mom or my two friends sad about me leaving away from their life.


I wish I could split myself, or just stop existing...

I am sorry if this doesn't belong here, had grammar errors, or if I bored you. I had to vent. 
Thank you.

248,What should I do?,"I'm a 15 year old boy, and I'm not sure what to do. I've been diagnosed with severe depression and nobody gives a shit enough to help me. Not my parents, not my friends, not my siblings, not doctors or psychologists and I'm starting to think that either taking antidepressants or ending it all is what's gonna help me. My parent's don't care and don't understand and ignore me and my problems, and all the doctors just refer me to a psychologist and nothing ever helps me. Every day I feel insanely tired, low energy and fatigued (I've done many blood tests to confirm it's not anything else) and it's getting worse and worse, going to school every day, tired as fuck with no motivation in life. Anybody willing to share their experiences with lexapro or perhaps recommend something that I should try?

EDIT: Thought I'd include my lifestyle before and after depression: I used to go to the gym and have a good life, but day by day just got worse and my tiredness/fatigue and loneliness/hopelessness just got worse, and I haven't been to the gym for about 6 months now, my life has just went downhill, and I've tried to go again, but it's just no use.

I also still have a healthy lifestyle, I go to school and play outside with friends but still feel depressed and tired asf all the time, especially when I get back home. I'm pretty sure that my problem is genetic and will require some medication to treat it.  


I also get plenty of sleep, 9+ hours every day, sometimes even over 11"
249,My struggle as a teenager.,"Hello, dear reader. My name is Dominic and I'm 14. As of recently, I have gone through 2 traumatic things. I have lost my mom due to an accident in the hospital, and I have just experienced a near death situation with being in a car crash last Friday. Before any of this happened, I was dealing with family issues.

I started smoking vapes at the age of 12. It then evolved into smoking cigarettes. After, I have smoked cigarettes for a total of 1 yr. Then, I started smoking weed and I still am, whenever I can get my hands on it. I am at a stand still as to what do I do with my life as of right now. I thought about suicide a couple of times but never considered it.

I don't know what to do right now, and it hurts me. I am tired of living and I just started. I failed school twice because of my grades and behavior. I feel as though that I have failed my parents, and that there is nothing I can do to correct myself. Every day, I feel drowsy and yet, I want to run away from it all.
I don't know what to do. I need guidance or I might become lost. Thank you."
250,I'm tired of this,Depression is just so fucking tiresome. I'm tired of always feeling like crap. I'm tired of trying different things to fix it. I'm tired of being disappointed in myself when they don't work. I'm tired of not being able to fix myself. I'm tired of feeling broken. I'm tired thinking I'm in an okay spot just for it to get bad again. I'm tired of being lazy and useless. I'm just so tired of being depressed. How many meds do I have to try before one works??? How long before I can take care of myself and my surroundings???? How many years will I have to waste before I'm normal????

I didn’t even see a doctor until two weeks after it happened. when i did i was diagnosed with pcs, and reading everything on here is stressful because the timeline for full recovery from pcs seems so long and i am starting college this fall.

I have been spending hours upon hours on my phone and i just feel so depressed and hopeless even when i do get out of the house. the worst part about this i’ve been experiencing vision problems now. it’s almost like visual snow, everything shakes when i focus on it to hard and i get flashes of light every now and then. the vision problems have been getting slightly better but i have anxiety that my vision is going to be fucked up forever. i also just don’t nt feel like myself at all really. In addition to this, i have been experiencing neck stiffness and I’m wondering if i sprained my neck and if that could be causing the vision problems.

254,I'm feeling a little down today,"Idk why it happens. It happens often. I start getting very nostalgic about the past and it just triggers my emotions and I burst out into tears. Maybe it's cause I feel safe in my childhood memories. I don't know what my purpose in life is. Don't have a girlfriend, don't have a job, don't have friends. I have my family but I feel so lonely inside and the only thing that makes me remarkably happy is remembering my childhood memories."
255,Kinda wanna just end it all,"Maybe I’m just seeking stupid but I’ve been having really heavy episodes of depression. Especially with relationships and friendships. Like friends have made it aren’t I might be the only one considering them actual friends. I’m always the one reaching out, sending videos, making conversation. If I don’t text, they don’t text me. The conversations I have to almost fight to make them work. And it’s been hitting me really hard so usually I have to hold on to things to hope on, like my favorite food, a new tv show, and such.
Like yesterday, I don’t usually get money (I can’t find a job for the life of me) so when my friend was going to finally pay me back $12 I was glad because I could finally get myself a treat or something and they accidentally sent it to the wrong person and wasn’t able to get it back. It kind of felt like a snapping point, like being on a tightrope and it just snaps and I feel back into this huge wave of depression. I’m tired of feeling like this. I’m sorry this is very long but it feels like nothing is going right. It’s been a countless loop. I want to stop the loop but don’t know how.

256,I hadn’t heard from my BF in 4 days and his location went dark. Is my BF depressed or is he trying to walk away?,"Some background. One year relationship (M 22) hadn’t heard from my bf (M 26) in almost 4 days and his location turned off 2 days into that.
It shut off right after he got home from work, that was the last ping it sent. We mainly just keep location on for emergencies (I have bad luck with car problems) and they've stayed on in the background for a year now.
Our last contact was over the weekend, and he did seem a tad distant. I had brought up how lately its felt like he doesn't really want or reciprocated my affection attempts over text. The last thing I heard from him before the radio silence was ""I'm sorry you feel that way I wish I could be better for you.""

On day 4 I was advised to reach out and check in on his safety, I sent a message and called a few times. Finally I got this text response: ""Sorry I have been rethinking my life lately and just been really depressed hence the withdrawal from everyone.""

I have seen him struggle with PTSD and thoughts of suicide in the past, and I’m just having a hard time gauging what to do in this situation and following that message. 

People who have experience with depression or have dated someone with depression, what are your thoughts? Has a partner ever said anything similar and what did you do?

258,ashamed for fatigue,"i was officially diagnosed 3 months ago with depression and i am struggling the most with fatigue.

i never knew i could be so easily tired this early in the day. i constantly feel like giving up on daily tasks and mentally abandoning things halfway because i struggle with sustaining attention and coming up with responses as well.

im unable to stay up past 10pm. i cant really go out with friends in the evening. I cant sleep over at my partner's place. i never even tried nightlife, and now i will never know what that is.

as a man, i am so ashamed and defeated that i am mentally and physically weak. and to be honest, i am a trans man. i have enough people doubting and refusing to acknowledge and affirm me, and now this is just more reasons for me to justify why i deserve how people treat me.

i know i am not alone, but oh, this is such a overwhelming sense of sadness, inferiority and defeat. I feel powerless.

i am currently on a 1.5h commute home at 10pm. reaching home would be such an achievement, but i wont feel any sense of accomplishment.

i will try again tomorrow. I hope you all too."
259,I (25F) have lived with depression and trauma my whole life. Can I get better?,"Hi, I'm looking for advice/success stories/whatever help you can provide to someone in my situation.

For as long as I can remember, I have lived with severe mental health issues. There is a lot of childhood trauma (diagnosed as C-PTSD), I'm autistic and have been going through periods of depression since my early teens. I probably have undiagnosed ADHD but with the waiting lists where I live at, that's going to be undiagnosed for a long time.

I struggle with: Having no friends, no romantic relationships, no positive relationships with my family, my flat being messy, feeling worthless, poor physical health, looking average on my best days, little success at work, going back to uni at 23 and not finishing my degree before the age of 27 (if I even manage to finish it), living from paycheck to paycheck. There isn't much going well for me but there are some things: I have an affordable flat, I am somehow employable and able to work at least part-time, I am unable to deal with ""normal"" social situations but do have strategies to manage the usual workplace interactions.

The main issue I have is: I've never experienced anything different. I don't know what living without depression and other mental health issues feels like. For me personally, I don't feel like I'm living \*with\* a mental health problem. The mental health problem feels like a part of me, like a personality trait or something. But I don't want to - I can't - spend another 60 or something years like this.  
The last two years, I actively looked for professional help, so far with little success. I can't afford therapy for more than two sessions a month and all of the anti-depressants I've tried (now five in total) have either made my depression worse or they had severe side effects. I'm open to trying new medications and strategies but there is little specialised psychiatric care for neurodivergent people especially when I can't afford private care. So maybe this won't be a hit.

I'm since a few months at a place in my life where I feel completely hopeless and as if there is no chance for me to live a fulfilling life. I see two options now: Kill myself or somehow find a way to heal/find meaning/reduce pain. I'm not expecting to become a happy person or some kind of a high achiever. But I'd like my quality of life to become better. As I'm in my mid-twenties this feels kind of impossible, I often read about my brain now being made of cement by now but I want to try whatever before giving up because a part of me still wants to get better."
260,I'm overwhelmed and sad,Feeling stuck and easily getting smashed by the force of the situation in all direction and money is the biggest culprit. I'm just trying to be happy for the sake of everyone else around me that knows my personality bcos I know it would disturbed them if I change a slight bit in my persona. I don't know maybe I maybe a people pleaser and also very ambitious but the thing is I'm only human and I can't do it all I'm still learning and right now I feel very stuck. I also feel like when theres a problem I'm the blame since Im really really ambitious and very naive as well consequently I feel like I have the burden of keepingeveryone around me happy and put the world in my shoulder. Also I'm very emotional which adds to all the problems I already have bcos I make the problem worse instead of doing anything I dread doing anything which altogether isn't  good combinations. Right now I just finished crying becos my sister brought in a stray cat they were maybe less than a month old and they make me leave it elsewhere after just a day the kittens are with us.  And I ponder about this and thought if my sister didn't pick it up and bring home there could be a much better home for them. A home where they weren't thrown out just again and in the cold breeze of the night. I brought the cats near a basketball court nearby the house where there would be cats meandering in the morning and lots of people. I cried a lot but didn't show it when I go back home and didn't say a word to anyone. So that what prompted me again to search for someone to connect with. 
261,Question,"I’ve been in a mental situation recently where I have basically given up on trying in school, but I’m not unable to get out of bed or anything like that, just for school
I was wondering if this is a depression thing? Or am I just lazy? Or what do I do? 
My working theory is that it’s basically giving up on trying and letting my world burn in the process of avoiding any effort."
262,"I cant push myself anymore, please someone talk sense to me","Please someone read my post. This is my last way to get help.  
  
I have severe untreated depression and attempted suicide twice 2 weeks ago. My mother beat my ass and threw me across the living room after witnessing my second attempt not too long ago. She told me that the suicide, if it was successful, would have benefitted her and my dad. And insulted me with the most hurtful words you can imagine and make fun of my depression.  
  
My parents are abusive( mostly psychologically abusive but my mom gets physical with me even if i havent done anything wrong) narcissistic, over controlling, give me academic pressure, unloving, incredibly sexist and hyper religious to the point i cant do anything fun and even drive as i turned an adult last year, dress like i want or go outside my house. They gave me trauma twice along with religious trauma, with a really horrible incident that has scar me for life, that led me to attempt suicide thrice(counting last year)  
  
I have no one else to support me, no adult, teacher, school counselor or relative i can trust. I have no friends. I begged my mother to get some psychiatric help but she refused and threatened me to go a religious school( not comfortable on revealing my religion) as she thinks faith is the answer to my problems. Screw that, if it was helpful, how comes i didnt get better from it.  
  
The only way to get therapy is to wait till i get independent from my family which is incredibly hard even if i graduate a levels next year, my mother will stick with me while im in uni.  
  
My depression is getting worse and worse and i havent touched a book for the past 2 months and i have a huge exam. Please, encourage me to study. I cant go to a hospital in any way as im even more restricted to go outside after my attempts.  
  
I need words of encouragement. I cant get help in this situation with my parents like this. I cant mess up my a levels again, if i fail, life is over with me as i will be married off( which i dont want) Im pushing myself but i just laze around, cry and self harm."
263,A reason to live: I guess I have figured it out,"I made a post few days ago, https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/s/Q97t3wJxJS

In that post I WANTED to figure out why the artist WANTED to be immortal ( I wish he really becomes immortal). I thought about it and a word stood out for me, ""WANT""! 

I guess the artist just wanted to live a long life. I do not think he has any reason more special than other people. I also want to live and live happily. So, now I am determined to not bother with reason(s) to live. I am just gonna keep pushing through since I want to live a happy life. I think I just needed to want something. Now that I have acknowledged that I do want something I can cook up a thousand reasons to be.

My head is pretty clear now, not as cloudy as it was few days ago. I just wanted to share my thoughts so I am making this post. I hope we can all live a happier life. I am gonna give it a try, I hope all of you stay strong too."
264,My mom never has time for me and it makes me depressed,"so i’m fifteen almost sixteen, and i litterally have no one. i’m ugly so i don’t really have any friends, 2 friends i got but don’t live in the same country as me. I tried getting more friends but i’m too ugly but really thats okay

however my mom never has time for me and is always busy with work, to the point that she is still working at home at 1 am

I do get that she has to work in order to get money of course, but she litterally never spends time with me. and if she does its only for an hour, and instead of being happy with me she only gets mad at me even tho i don’t do anything. some days she tells me that she’ll come home earlier, but she’s always late 
and never updates me during the day about it. 

Whenever i tell my mom that i don’t like how shes always busy with her work she always switches the conversation topic and/or gets mad at me even tho she knows i’m right.

How do i solve this problem because i can’t do this anymore and it’s been going on for so long? i’m so tired of this, just thinking about my mom makes me cry. 

Thank you so much for reading all of this ❤️"
265,I have lost the will to continue,"I don’t want to bring up my whole story here as it’s way too much. The main reason for my depression is that I became disabled a few years ago. It’s not the only reason though. The last years consisted of a lot brutal stuff and it was always the same routine: I experienced something deeply hurtful, fell into a hole and pulled myself out of it one or two days later and continued.

After I invested great hope in something important and got disappointed for the millionth time, something changed within my mind. It was like four days ago. Since these four days I’ll only leave my bed for going to the bathroom. I barely ate. I can’t pull myself out of this hole this time. It’s like I‘m emotionally completely numb while there is this feeling of pure hopelessness and my conviction that it’s never getting better. That it would be the best if I‘m dead. I never had that before. The pure thought of having to continue with my shite life is just unbearable.

Is this something that might resolve on its own? I definitely don’t want to go to some kind of mental hospital or talk to a psychiatrist. "
266,I sometimes understand why people become extremists or dictators,"I know they were angel at a baby and a normal child, but some traumatic events like abuse and bullying had turned them into monster. Maybe because of that, they developed hatred towards this sick world and are just doing some favor and payback to those ignorant people. I don’t praise them, but I feel like they are being evil to fight the true evil. It’s my opinion, so don’t take it too seriously"
267,I occasionally think of doing something dangerous,"These days, I feel like everyone in this world is intentionally avoiding me or mocking me secretly. For example, today some two girls sitting behind bus seat were talking something and it seemed to apply to me. Also, in the lecture hall some boys were calling things such as nerd and it seemed to apply to me. I’m just tired of having to live through this world that is hostile and weird to me and the fact that I lack social skills and got bullied when I was in elementary and middle school. I hate the fact that I can’t live normally like others and I’m always alone without someone except family. So today I carried the knife with me and put it in the bag so I can ‘wield and protect’ myself just in case something bad happens. I just want to end all of this no matter what I do. Sorry for the bad writing and horrible saying, but I can’t live normally with these thoughts going on my mind so I wrote this down."
268,I dont know if im depressed,"I dont realy feel sad or happy, I dont care about anything, nor do I have a goal. I have been thinking about ending it all sence high school (but I cant cause I have a family that cares and put too much resources in me) when I realized that everything is so meh or a means to an end. To be honest I think I had many friends but keeping up with them was impossiable, so I stopped (It could also be because talking to people even my family is exhausting) . I do laugh at random stuff on youtube shorts. Also, another wierd thing, when im crying or angry, its as if my body is a instagram filter and my mind or me is still rational (for example if I was crying, I would think/talk to my self on why am I crying then deduce that its because of a seen in a movie or something). TLDR My day to day is not sad, just perpetually meh (some days it feels like shit). Can the people reading tell me about their symptoms?"
269,Do orgasms become normal again when quiting SSRI'S?,"Yeah ever since i started taking SSRI'S (sertraline) my orgasms are just meh, like the the orgasm feels like its 10 times less powerfull as it was before, does this return to normal after quiting SSRI'S"
270,Heading back to how I felt before coming off ssri.,"little introduction to myself I'm 34 m from Ireland. so two years ago started my journey on ssris. started on sertraline it was giving me too much energy and I was loosing so much sleep. I had insomnia before taking sertraline and the anxiety and depression was making it worse. After 6 or so months I moved to mirtazipine for a year and a half. I had alot of unresolved issues from my teens and adulthood plus with my mum dying 5 years ago I fell into a deep depression and anxiety that I just buried. decided to get some help cause I was fed up feeling like crap 24/7. did some CBT therapy but I never found it helpful if anything it made me feel worse. came off my ssri before Christmas after titrating down cause it muted everything and if anything I was getting more depressed. drs didn't know I was getting more depressed but I didn't feel the meds I was taking were the answer after taking them for so long. anyways after coming off them I felt great up until about 2 weeks ago. bam I wake up one morning and something switched in my head and I now feel hopeless and lost and feel like I'm in a massive hole I can't get out of, haven't slept in about 3/4 days and sleep in general has been poor when I do sleep. nothing has happened to me personally since coming off the ssri to make me feel this way so I don't understand why I'm feeling like this. it's a feeling I can't shake no matter what I'm trying to do. I keep fit go to the gym regularly and play sports, don't drink often (only at Christmas, family events and my birthday). even then it's never more than a few pints. I don't take drugs either. anyways that's my story. if I contact my local Dr how likely do you think it is they will put me on ssri again and make me see CBT guy? the thought is making me more anxious.

271,Struggling HARD,"I just sent a long email to my therapist but in a nutshell my employment has gotten increasingly stressful. Feels like I walk on eggshells. Suffering from MDD, anxiety, panic attacks when things get this bad, might have ADD but not diagnosed yet.

I am terrified I will lose my job any minute. I got written up recently and told next time is a final warning or termination. I made a mistake this week and have a meeting with my managers tomorrow. I have been panicking all week. Can’t eat. Basically folding into myself.

I try hard to do a good job but I do get distracted easily and I get bored easily. My mind never shuts off. 

I make a decent lower middle class salary for my area and the job is only a few minutes from me. So I’m comfortable in my setting. I’m also in a somewhat rural area so there isn’t much else job wise unless I go into the cities.

I basically send my therapist a plea for help as I don’t know what to do. Just the thought of being let go and having to start all over (after 6 years) terrifies me. My jaw clenches shut and I start freezing.

It’s very hard for me to express verbally how I feel either I can’t get it out or I just completely break down.

Idk why things for people like me just can be easy. It’s harder.

I wish I knew someone who I could go work for without losing much in regards to salary and d benefits.

I wish I could maybe go on disability and just enjoy the rest of my life , I’m 41 next week. But I think it pays horribly and my wife doesn’t make enough to keep us afloat.

I do think about suicide. I can’t do it. It’s a fear I have of death since I was a child. I think I have trauma. I know I have sexual abuse trauma for sure which hasn’t helped me in life.

So I feel stuck and helpless. "

Just how?"
274,It's so hard to live,I'm feeling suicidal again. I know I won't kill myself because it'd against my religion but I feel so terrible and I don't wanna be alive anymore. I can't stand living anymore. I didn't think depression would take over my entire teenage years and ruin a quarter of my life. Plus finding out that I'm autistic is just making me feel terrible. I've tried anti-depressents and I'm on my fourth therapist and nothings really helped. I'm so tired. If it wasn't for my religion I would probably kill myself soon. I just wanna slit my wrists and bleed to death or maybe overdose like I've already done before. But I guess I have to stay alive

276,I don't know how to Do it,"I don't know how I'm supposed to live this life. I have not felt depressed for the first time in my life last year when I moved countries and met my boyfriend. Not my first but the first and only I really cared about (I'm almost 30). Everything with him felt new and exciting so I guess the hormones associated with what people call love (which I didn't believe in) made me happy for the first time in my life. It's not like I was stupid enough to think that my depression was magically cured, but deep down I wished for it. At the same time I dreaded it coming back full force every day and that's what happened last week. I tried to deal with it on my own like I always did, the sleepness nights, the existential dread and panic attacks at night and the compulsive thoughts to jump from every bridge and in front of every car. But yesterday, on his birthday, I couldn't contain it. I suddenly got scared looking at him. Of the inavoidable future and the burden I would be on him. And I showed it by being an asshole and at the end of our fight just running home where I sent him an accusatory message about breaking up. I hate myself, I ruined not only his birthday but also the celebration of him finding a new job. He was my last chance. That's what I told myself at the beginnend of our relationship. I can't do this anymore and I can't do this to anymore anymore. I feel incredibly manipulative for basically forcing him to have a talk this weekend by just appearing at his doorstep in teams. But at the same time I break down every time I think about him not being in my life. But it is not fair of me to make him stay in a relationship with me. It's just so hard. Nobody, not even my family, has ever even liked me and I don't care for anyone but him. If I lose him, I don't think I can recover from it. For the first time I had something to look forward to but I ruined it by questioning his feelings for me and projecting that fear on him. Now I'm lying here wondering how I'm supposed to endure this pain. It's even worse than before meeting him or at least it feels like it because I haven't felt it in a while. I don't really know what I expect from this Post but at least I stopped shaking and hyperventilating while typing it."
277,Mood monitoring,"I have a quick question for you. If you're dealing with depression, what is the easiest way to monitor your mood?

Please let me know, I want to help! <3"
278,I can’t even stand looking at a piano.,"I’ve been playing piano since 6. It was a pretty early start and I’ve gained recognition for my fast progress. I’ve been to some contests and got awards, and tried to pass levels. Even though I never took piano seriously, and only practiced an average of 30-40 minutes a day, I was still learning something new everyday. It was still something I was good at, something I was partially proud of. Later after I was introduced to RCM, I started taking a different path, some of my progress before was lost, and I realized there is so much areas I needed improving on. I went to lessons regularly, although progress wasn’t as fast, I was still practicing regularly and I was able to play pieces I liked. When I was around 11. I passed my RCM level 8 practical and theory exam. Preparing for the exams had been most efficient in improving my skills. Later I was learning level 9, and I had switched my teacher. This new teacher made me nervous for every lesson, and I was dreading it every two days before class. However my skills were improving greatly so I guess there is nothing to complain about. But things escalated and I started getting anxiety before every class and it made my stomach sick. It was then I decided to switch back to my old teacher and continue on with where I left off. My progress slowed once again and I didn’t do any exams at the time. When I was 12 I started level 9 history, and I was one hell of a procrastinator. I spent a whole year but only studied effectively in the last month before the deadline, even though I got a pretty good mark, it definitely took too long to complete, and I was not proud at all. That was what made me realize how much faster others have finished theirs and moving on, while I wasted a whole year? Soon after I started harmony 9, I know I shouldn’t even be complaining because how easy it was for the people that studied along with me. Yes, I joined an online group taught by a different teacher. That was the absolute worst part about learning music. When everyone else seems to get everything while your own brain is completely fried. When the teacher finished most of the lessons she said I needed extra help. Which just makes me feel like an outcast. I was in the middle of doing those catch-up lessons when I, out of nothing in this world, told my parents I didn’t want to continue learning piano anymore. And if you have read to the very end I want to thank you for taking the time to do so, and I want to share the fact that, things went downhill so quick after I decided to give up. I never finished harmony 9, and it makes me feel like a failure. I did started to play level 10 before, but never took the exam. Now I’m 14 and I feel like I was worse than I was 2 years ago, because I’m cowardly enough, that I can’t even look at a piano anymore. So I never proved myself to be worthy of having lessons again. And every night I just think about the fact that I wasted so much time and money, but all I did was give up? I tried and tried to play my favourite pieces, but I would get so frustrated because of my declining skills and feel absolutely worthless. I feel like everyone else is moving on, passing exams after exams, while I keep retreating, back to the place where I started."

So I have been feeling depressed because of an incident in 2022 dec. I am in college rn and I have to talk to people and I want to make friends. But when I do I am just not like how I was before. I just cannot be as funny or in the present moment as I was before. Anyone else? "
280,I can’t handle this pressure,"I do not know what to do with my life. I have been working hard to make this representative sports team for my region and I have actually made it. I am one step away but now that I’m actually here I’m too nervous. I feel like I don’t belong here, there are guys here that I am competing against that don’t even take it seriously as if they are already confident that they will be selected. I feel like I’m useless, it was stuck in my mind the whole training and I believe I performed bad. There is one more selection before the final squad and I am considering suicide if I don’t make the final cut.

I don’t have anything after this besides work, I don’t have any friends, no relationships and playing video games is boring now I’m just thinking about what I should do with my life. I’m just a quiet guy who keeps to himself and puts in the work but I believe I am outclassed at training and am clueless about what’s going on. I am so mad at myself that I finally got to where I wanted to be and now just want to kill myself for performing bad. I have been thinking about this for a while but I feel like it has full caught onto me and I can’t escape."
281,I hate myself for the way I'm nowadays.,"29 (Male)

Struggling with severe Depression for almost a decade. It pretty much ruined my Life. 

I have no friends left. No romantic experience. I became unable to hold conversations with Strangers (in IRL).

Even during Work or labour School, there is this painfull realisation , that nobody cares about me. Not really at least. 

My Parents of course would like to claim otherwise, but that ain't true.

Having No one that can understand your suffering and instead getting labaled as just weird or just boring Hurts a lot and makes social Interactions tiresome.

Sometimes i Just think about ending all of it. I mean, whats the point ? 

I don't see myself in the future, being happy and content with a Woman at my side and children. Being alone hurts. More then any physical paine that I ever witnessed at least.

Don't know how longer i can cope with it.

282,Depression,"I (26F) have been struggling with my mental health since 2017. I was diagnosed with depression in the military and was discharged in 2018 for it.  I live on my own and I get really lonely sometimes. But I don’t feel like being around anyone anymore. I’ve stopped hanging out with anyone outside my boyfriend and rarely see my family anymore. I do miss them but I can’t bring myself to come around anymore. I go through bouts where I’m doing really well but it never lasts long. It’s like a cycle and I end up quitting jobs, school, or whatever I’m doing because of my mental health. Nothing brings me pleasure anymore. I’ve tried more medications than I can count. I was doing therapy but recently I just stopped caring and ended up canceling my last 3 appointments. I feel like even my therapist gave up on me. Therapy didn’t even make me feel better, but it gave me an outlet and someone to talk to about my feelings. 
I lay in bed all day on my phone scrolling through tik tok. Right now everything feels like a chore, even showering and basic things to take care of myself. Nobody reaches out to me to check on me or ask if I’m okay, not even my boyfriend. I just don’t understand how nobody notices I’m suffering. I just feel like depression is a never ending battle for me and that it will never get better. I feel like my mental health has only gotten worse the older I get. I just don’t know what to do anymore because I can’t keep living this way. My 20’s have been the absolute worst time of my life."
283,Cant feel anything ,"M(27) Going to give a tldr but i’ve gone through my childhood pretty much alone , with only my dad being my friend but he died when i was 16. Pretty much every life lesson i had to learn the hard way without any advice, the only advice i got from my mom were religious advice and i’m not religious so i never took her advice.

After going through some really really major shit relationship wise, being cheated on, financially broke, betrayed by friends, constantly being told i’m  not the perfect man. I finally bounced back in life, created an okay self business, had a daughter with my new partner. 

I feel like everything up to this point i cant feel emotion quite literally. Anything sad i just brush it off, anything happy it lasts maybe 2-3 seconds. Even having a hard time trying to connect with my 4 month old daughter. My partner being a very over emotional person and takes everything to heart and i cant feel the same way so we have major arguments alot, but to me it was never a problem.

Am i lacking emotional intelligence or am i just numb to everything? "

im thinking about overdosing on 875 mg of buspirone but that wont kill me.just will make everutjing worse.

please help. please. i dont want to  feel. tired anymore"
286,Failed attempt ,"Im really not sure how to feel about all this. 2 days ago i woke up at 7 am and was studying for my class at 11:30, i have depression, PTSD, BPD and anxiety, so the suicidal thoughts are always there but i did not have any specific suicidal ideations/plans at least for the night before or that morning. The only thing to highlight would the convo before i sleep with my boyfriend [together 5y and half, lived together 5y] - on subject of intrusive thoughts, to which i said suicide and he responded strangling me or my eldest cat [i am aware how this sounds _in the past 5 years he has never harmed me or any of our cats, as he says it himself they are his thoughts that he doesn’t really want to share with anyone]


 In about 10 mins just wrote a paragraph on my notes telling my boyfriend that im sorry and to please take our 3 cats to PetSmart or SPCA [animal shelter] if he cant keep them. Then took the sharpest knife i could find, went to the room to grab my strongest pill [Quetiapine 50mg/ took the whole bottle, i think about 35-40 in it].

The sound of grabbing the pill from my drawer woke him up, and ruined my initial plan of overdose and cut in the bathroom with locked doors. He got up went to rhe bathroom and took a shower [usually takes him 30-40 mins, the time i needed for everything to work but he came out sooner somehow], i then went to the room, took my cats out and closed the door, took the whole bottle of Quetiapine and started cutting, as much as i could, my wrist, my arm, my neck, stomach, thigh but it wasn’t enough. He came in and and as soon as he saw me just said “you are so fucked” , came in and asked what i took, slapped me in the face [ i guess to see if im conscious?] and then called 911. I just vaguely remember they came in and thats it. 
I was just released from the psychiatrist emerg this morning. Last night, [not in person, he left to go to the gym to cool down, came back at 9 but was not allowed in since visitor time was up] he sent me a message asking if its ok for him to move out since he needs his own space.  

I don’t know how to feel, i feel empty, numb, disgusted of myself [my boyfriend told both his parents everything a-z on the same day] but also angry that it failed, i hate myself, hqte being here, my body, my skin - everything is just too much. The cuts are everywhere and i cant just scape it , no matter how big a bandage, its still here. Its 5:13 am now, i cant sleep and all i can think about is the fact that im such a shit person to leave my 3 cats and my boyfriend and be so selfish to just end it and the fact rhat he could so easily decide on leaving. 

I understand he needs to care about himself first, that he should prioritize his own health and mental well-being over a piece of shit like me but i guess i just didnt expect this from him so soon, idk. I dont even know why im writing all this or what i hope to achieve. 

How do you guys deal with yourself post failure?"
287,Are people with severe depression responsible for their behavior/action?,"Everyone has their own unique set of beliefs. I understand that this forum will get a lot of dislikes due to the controversy. For me personally, I always felt like my MDD was controlling me as if I was a puppet rather than me controlling myself. The small percent of control I had was to seek help (belittled by therapist and denied proper diagnosis). I wasn't diagnosed until I ended up in the hospital. This doesn't mean I'm answering my own question on whether I'm responsible or not. I just want insight on other people's opinions to create my own conclusions.  
Obviously, the people hurt by poor behavior don't deserve that treatment. Some people may challenge this belief by saying that it's okay if they hurt you, but ""revenge is never the answer.""

I had a father with severe anxiety so bad he went to the hospital several times a year. After half a life span of battling anxiety, he had finally found his way of coping. Seeing the drastic change, I really questioned myself. I have forgiven him whole heartedly despite all the pain, but he still caused me all that trauma. Yet, I don't blame him for it. I don't hold him accountable either. Everyone is entitled to their own opinions, beliefs, etc. My experience most likely isn't the same for everyone."
288,Am I being depressed again or just lonely?,"Hi. Im 26F. Working in a financial company. Only child. Broken family. Working to support my mom and dogs. Diagnosed with depression last 2020.

I was prescribed with escitalopram. I took them for a month then due to the pandemic, I stopped and haven’t been able to go back to my psychiatrist.

Since then, ive been good, i think. I cried. I laugh. There were good moments and bad ones.

There were also moments that I think about just ending it. But ive managed to brush those thoughts away, so far.

But now, i feel so numb. I cant sleep again. Yeah, i laugh with my friends. But my mood will suddenly shift.

I tried exercising. I tried listening to self-help podcasts. I tried focusing at work. I tried gaming. But i still end up here, feeling numb. Feeling tired of life. "
289,Why do I feel so lonely?," I have everybody I need my mom my family but somehow I still feel lonely. As if this Loneliness will never come to and end. I’ve always felt lonely my whole life especially when my grandma died. I never showed emotion tho I’ve never understood what’s wrong with me why can’t I feel? My grandma just died I should be crying and grieving. I never understood why I could never feel or show emotion I hated my life I hated everything about it. I felt as if there was no purpose in life for me now that my grandma left. This house is not the same with out her nothing is nothing will never feel
Normal without her in my life. I felt as if everyday there was new lesson on why shouldn’t be here. When she passed away I grew up. I started hating life even more I hated my body, my face, my brain everything that exist about me. Life wasn’t enjoyable no more, because when you hate your body it’s hard to enjoy the rest. Although I was felt lonely now I feel even more lonely it’s a feeling of emptiness a feeling that you can never escape a feeling where you rethink life and its meaning. I want to live for my grandma but without her nothing feels possible."
290,Social Media and mental health.,"A few months ago. I gave up social media for the most part, the exception being fb marketplace. It has really been positive for mental health. I had no idea how much toxicity was there."
291,My first thought waking up for the past year is how much I don't want to be in this world. ,"I'm tired of it all, and I don't even know if I want treatment anymore. I can't handle the process myself, I'd rather just die "
292,I think i’m stuck like this forever ,"im 21yo and have been struggling with depression for as long as i can remember but i’m starting to feel like i am getting too old for this and i can no longer see the light at the end of the tunnel. 
the way i function now is no better if not worse than how i was at 15. 

i work part time(i don’t bother working any extra shifts) , i am only capable of taking 2 classes at a time at my community college(me transferring to university is nowhere in sight), i don’t have my license or permit(i live in socal), i don’t pay bills, i’m in credit card debt, i go along with anything that my friends want to do even if i hate it. this is just the tip of the iceberg 

i have tried therapy on and off last year and i just ghosted my most recent therapist because i was always late to appointments or would just forget about it so i got too embarrassed to keep seeing her, i told myself i’d work harder at trying to get better this year but i feel incapable but i still haven’t tried looking for another therapist— i also have been prescribed medication but i am bad at taking them as well so idk if it’s just not working or i haven’t been consistent enough with it.  

I need to start my adult life but right now i cant do anything other than absolutely nothing. but the longer i feel like this the more im ashamed and just think that im never going to reach a place of normalcy (i also feel very immature that i can’t do basic daily things for myself)"
293,"No longer looking for ""better""... I will just exist until I can erase myself completely. I'm disappearing in every way I know how. ","I'm so exhausted of enduring and having to be positive in the face of it all to essentially ease the discomfort of others. So I have decided to do the bare minimum to get by, to survive without expectations or hopes. I will embrace the Numb. If I'm not allowed to kill myself (the recent attempt failed and traumatized my family and friends), and I'll never escape this cycle of poverty, I'll just exist as little as possible. Maybe then it won't hurt so much. Living that is. I'll work three jobs again if needed, go home, sleep, and repeat every day until I am granted the grace to die.

I want to start fresh though. Move to a new state, change my name and number, delete my socials, and be as nonexistent as possible. I don't want to be known anymore, not in this version of me. I want to be erased. I don't care about making new friends or dating. I won't even worry about getting a job with health insurance. Let nature take its course, because what's the point of trying to keep this body barely alive. Even if I lose the ability to walk because of my condition. I'll crawl to my grave if I have to. 

I'm beyond broke and struggling to find jobs. But if I can get one soon, I'll spend the next three months saving to move. I don't care what state, just something affordable. I considered a storage unit since I may only be able to afford to live in a car or motel, or I can just sell everything I own because what's the point of keeping it. 

Today I applied for the name change, which I'll keep a secret. When I leave, I won't tell anyone, just pack and go. No more drowning and pretending I'm okay because of my love for others. No more daydreaming about the future or imagining that things will change. I'm 30; I know better. I don't know why it took me so long to accept my reality, but maybe now the pain won't be so deep. "
294,Overwhelming grief and sadness,"This has been such an excruciating month. Everything good goes or unravels. I just feel like one of those people lately where it’s just one bad thing after another. Like I’m the friend who always is going through some shit. It feels like no matter what I do, where I go I’ll never be happy. Cause wherever you go there you are and I hate my brain. I feel a lot of… self hatred and disappointment over every aspect of my life and the world. It’s just a lot. It’s just an endless loop. There’s so much beauty out in the world and I know it, but it feels so fleeting and it doesn’t measure up to all the grief and sadness I have. It doesn’t matter where I am, who I am with, what I buy, what I take, it’s always there waiting for me and sometimes that feels unbearable."
295,Chapter 1 my life,"I moved from Virginia when I was 6 to California. The kids didn’t like me from the start. The only kid I connected with was in 3rd grade, named Mo. This friendship lasted until the summer, going into 6th grade. Where it all started, me and Mo started talking. We had the same taste in music, and we thought we were so mature. The first time I did something illegal was when we went around our school after hours and searched the trash cans for liquor. We found some, put it in a bottle, and drank it. It was disgusting. Right after that, well, it only got worse. The first time I got my hands on a vape was when I stole it from my friend's mom (who later found out).
And we and Mo burned that shit out in two days flat. Remember, I was in 5th grade. We looked through his dad's part of the house and found a lighter and a box of cigarettes. We smoked them, laughed, and rapped some songs I came up with. Man, I was a dumbass kid. We smoked every day on anything we could get ahold of, and Mo even got a girl friend. We did this until he bought two vapes off of a kid at our school one week before his birthday and birthday plans. 3 days before his birthday, his mom finds them, and he’s grounded for 3 months. One month after he was ungrounded, he found out that he was moving five hours away. We hung out one last time, and he’s texted all of my friends and his ex-girlfriend but not me. Not one goddamn text call or email. Not shit. It makes you want to die inside. I still think about him and how he is doing till this day"
296,Feeling pretty hopeless (22F),"I try everyday to get by and do my work but more and more I've just been feeling stuck, like everything is pointless and that nothing matters. I've always felt like the black sheep of my family and even more so since out of my cousins I'm the only one who isn't college bound..  I didn't have the money to go and frankly my mental is not good for the responsibility of both full-time work and school, it's hard dragging myself out of bed now. I try to be there for my friends and family with their mental struggles but it feels like they don't reciprocate.

I know people will suggest therapy but I don't have the time or resources for it to be consistent. I need a better job with better healthcare but it's hard to do with limited skills and time. But even with those things I can't help but feel that I'll have this loneliness and emptiness inside, that I don't belong anywhere. And even if I achieve those things I probably won't be happy. It feels like there is no hope

I lied about so many things.. big or small. There were so many little things that I have lied about for absolutely no reason. Just the smallest, stupidest things. Things that I had absolutely no reason to lie about and things that do not even matter. I just lied all the time for no reason.

All the lies I’ve told.. some being big.. some being small.. some being tiny & pointless.. I don’t know why I did it. I really don’t. It eats me alive inside. I am a different person now and I am an honest person. I have worked on myself and made myself better. But I dwell on my past 24/7 and even being a better person now.. I cannot enjoy myself or my life whatsoever because I am so ashamed, embarrassed, and humiliated of my past and my past mistakes. I just want to forgive myself and move on. I don’t know why I did it.. and I think maybe I will never know.. but right now.. all I want is to forgive myself and enjoy my life and not dwell on my past 24/7 to the point where it’s making me physically ill.

This feeling, wanting, does not go away. The people around don't seem to get that. From the very core of my being I want to die. The most fucked up part is if I do my sister will come with me. She's not one who makes promises like that. So I can't even have the thing I want the most. Who ever said it gets better in time is a fuckin liar lmao maybe for some people it does help but I guess I fall into the other ""some"". Anyway, I'm tired maybe tomorrow I will feel mentally and emotionally okay. Too bad it doesn't work like that lol "
304,I neglect myself so much,"Im a 22 year old male, i don't work nor am i in any kind of education. i shower like 3 times/ week, brush my teeth like once per week. i hate feeling dirty but i just can't be bothered, it feels too taxing to do anything productive. i eat once per day, i never feel hungry, i sleep at least 15 hours every day. It feels like im slowly letting myself rot, i don't really care, just waiting to have the courage to end it i guess"
305,Why nothing tastes good recently,"I recently fell into the physically crushing cannot move depression, which I haven't experienced in several years. I know what put me into it, that's beside the point, my friends and support system were really good about letting me sit through it and then making me go out, but I have not felt the same in a weirdly recent way, and my partner who is incredibly intelligent, made the observation that as Americans and some of our friends were Brits, There is this Insane unequivocal weight, since October 7, That we feel through our human species, That the millions of people seeing their homes and civilization destroyed, the tens of thousands Killed and dying and wasting in hospitals, the screams of countless Children and their parents wailing with no one to console them, this horrendous Slaughter Is happening right now, and we can't do anything to stop it, and it's our money, tax dollars that we Really like to pay into our society, are being spent to cause these screams and this sorrow, and It doesn't matter how much good music we listen to and how much we make each other laugh, that weight Is on Bodies and our souls... and my partner was right, and I think it's important to mention because as a planet we're in a Hole right now. I am old enough to have gone through when nothing tasted good because it felt Empty and hopeless, multiple times, But I guess I'm just saying, If you're feeling this weight as a part of Humanity, And things don't taste right, it's not just you. You're not broken it is the most normal human thing to feel this."
306,Depression made me stuck in life,"Becuase of depression I haven't had intrest in things I used to so now I have zero idea what to do as my future career and degree. I was beginning high school when first diagnosed and I thought my career choice could be something I deal with later. Now I have to choose my degree by next semester (I'm almost halfway through my university degree) and decide my future, but nothing intrests me anymore. I genuinely don't know what to do at all. I might have to drop out for a bit to decide."
307,Was doing good this seasonal episode until I had time to think ,"Last winter was shitty, the one before was the worst in my life, but this time I managed well.          

I've got a job, I was doing ok in uni and socializing a bit there, I was working out, I was practicing piano.  
Now I sprained a wrist, nothing serious, but at least for a week I'm on a medical leave, so no job, no piano, no working out. Ignoring uni as well - coming with bandage felt humiliating.   

So now I can look back at all I do, and I just feel like a wound down machine.  
I'll never afford all plastic surgery I need, I've got nothing going on that warrants moving away, so what's the point of working? Impulsive spending, drinking, other pointless shit.        
I don't have any talent, so what's the point of piano, or any other activity? Just to do something with my hands, it's mechanical, you can train even a monkey.    
I'm not intelligent enough to stand out in my supposed oversaturated career field, so what's the point of studying? Biding my time before I'm definitively stuck at the dead end job.    
What the point of working out with shit genetics? ""Stiff upper lip"", the stupid idea that working for things others get for free isn't pathetic.   
I'm not pretty enough to be loved, or even to justify putting any effort into getting to know me, so what's the point of socializing?     Getting to perform my fabricated personally. 

It's all completely pointless, there's nothing waiting for me. 
"
308,fuck,"And again alcool and weed and again people talking shit, family feeling like stranger ... I've trying beeing ""normal"" and I quit, I want to blow off I want to be takedown but no I just getting hurt by those fuckers and they never deliver. They never finish the job I swear they're lucky yesterday I could have rolled over them in my car but then they get the easy leave they didn't allow me.. . So I'll do it myself, I'll burn my selfout, let me with my addiction leave me alone, I don't need any human interaction I don't need any love, I need to be gone."
309,I really fucked up,"I have been getting stalked and harassed to the point of something you'd see in a movie, I want to hold it all in so people think I'm normal, but I never do, and now everyone just thinks I'm paranoid, which was easy to shake at first, bus after about 5 months I'm just depressed. Pushing 40 at my mother's house was not the plan. My ex rightfully wants nothing to do with me, as I broke up with her right before it all started. If my mom was not alive I'd be out of the country or not alive. And I've been here before, this the fourth time I've moved back on to my parents house as an adult. I try everything and everything just fails. It won't be this way forever, but for now just looking to ride out the depression wave"
310,I don’t care about myself. At all.,"So, I have been perpetually depressed for over 2 years now. I believe I know what snowballed it. The summer after I graduated high school, I was very happy. I had a lot of friends, I went outside, I ran and lifted weights, etc. 

I knew this was gonna end, however. I had to move, and everyone’s off to college now. I was still around (kinda), but I didn’t have my own car at the time, so I didn’t really have the freedom of going wherever I wanted. Eventually, I’m not hanging out with people as much, and not making any new friends. It was my first winter break where it hit me: I realized, “wait, I don’t actually think I’m truly enjoying anything”

Fast forward to my sophomore year of college. I had no clue what I wanted to major in, skipped classes all the time, no friends, no consistent habits, etc. I’d have phases of going to the gym regularly, eating well, even looking better and more in-shape, but I never ended up keeping up those habits. Because I never ended up CARING. About ANYTHING.

So, here’s the present: To run things down, I’m unfortunately smart enough where most of the time, I don’t try in my classes, but I get away with passing them. I have made zero friends in the past 3 years, I am not much bigger or stronger than I was that summer after high school, and I still don’t care about anything (obviously).

This semester, I actually have gotten better with keeping up with homework and such. Except for one class. I have a midterm tomorrow (well technically today), and I have had ALL DAY to prepare for it. But I end up doing NOTHING. I have shot myself in the fucking foot. Do I care? Do I not care? Am I fucking bipolar? WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME?????? I’m gonna lose my mind. One day everything’s fine and the next I self destruct and potentially set myself up for failing a class.

I definitely need help holy shit"
311,Why clinical sessions would work,"I am a 20-year-old female Muslim third-year medical student, I've recently been diagnosed with depression by three different doctors. Despite having a very supportive family and a seemingly perfect life, I've experienced occasional strong symptoms of depression since childhood. While I've learned to cope with these symptoms over the years, my recent inability to attend some tests prompted my sister to insist that I seek help.

I must admit, I am generally low in negative emotions, and my life is quite good, if not perfect. However, I remain skeptical about how speaking to a doctor could help alleviate my occasional symptoms. Nevertheless, I am open to exploring potential solutions. 

"
312,Feeling directionless tonight,"I feel like I'm just floating through life right now. I had all these hopes and expectations of what my life would be like by now and none of it has happened. I just feel like a waste of a life and I just want a redo. I see others around me achieve what they want or things I wanted for myself but I'm stuck being the cautionary tale of a failure and left envious of their success. I can literally see the pity when they ask what I'm doing in my life or my future plans and I have nothing good to tell them. I'm not even a main character in my own life atp. I have all these ambitions but I can't seem to get myself to make any progress and I feel like I'll never get close to where I need to be to even find a job in my degree field, that took me 7 years to even finish, and finally move far away from here.

I said I'd give myself this year to find a job but with the way things are looking I might as well just end it now. I just don't think I can do another year of struggling until I can find something to support myself with."
313,Sadness is a very agonizing feeling,I feel pretty sad right now and what bums me out the most is that I know that I’m powerless because there is nothing I can do to feel better. I’ve come to learn that time heals all wounds but it gets to a point where it is very agonizing to just have to power through this feeling. Any tips? I usually don’t rant on Resdit because of terrible past experiences but at this point I’m open for whatever suggestions.
314,On suicide,"Just something ive been thinking about (not fleshed out yet) is we should hold on for life itself not bc of its specific meaning but bc its precious in and of itself. 

This is in context of the genocide in gaza. If i were there i couldnt imagine being able to bear the tiniest amount of that level of trauma and loss. Id lose it. But theyre holding on and i cant imagine why but they are. Their very existence is meaningful not at all what they do. I also have never been religious or spiritual but their conviction is making me lean towards that way. If they can still affirm life, faith, love then i could too.

So even if i dont want my life or cant beat it or literally cannot move to do anything i should still exist and be of service to others. If i give away my life then at least its for someone and something. I realize im not writing this at my worst and im in a relatively ok headspace so idk if i can commit to thinking this way when the depression kills me slowly (and ofc i do realize its an illness i take meds and did ect and tms so not minimizing at all i know its debilitating). So maybe whenever we think of suicide we affirm life instead and thats what keeps us going. (Just reflecting on how can someone still have the will to resist given the circumstances).


"
315,Dying Is better than Loneliness ,"Have been sick for the past couple of days.  Just in my house with no one. No one of my friends have asked about me since two weeks and the idea of killing my self stated to gather being more and more. 
Why everyone hate me why im the falt for everyone. Why should i be alive if no one wants to talk or have fun and go somewhere. 
I just want to die. 
And in this community all the men are looking for girls for some reason. Guys we are all lonely here. Therefore you have to help others people there. "
316,Am I make the right decision?,Tried to quit a job and they say everything to convince me to stay. It was a tough decisions to make. Being here make me commit suicide 3 times so I quit before the 4th one happen and look forward to freelance. Am I make the right decision? Or should I have patience and continue to work this job? It's work pressure that make me want to die. I hate that I have to communicate with more than one person like a chain. I'm not good at talking.
317,lowering my meds?,"i have been on antidepressants for about 2 years now, turning 25 this year. i had an appointment today with my psychiatrist, who had the feeling that now that i am studying - things should be getting better. thus suggested to slowly get off my meds. i didnt really know what to say. of course i want to be off them eventually. and i did tell him that i still struggled with bad thoughts and anxiety but didnt specify, thus he suggested slowly lowering.

i just cant open up to anyone about how much i am in a struggle with myself. i hate myself so much and am just burnt out at this point by just being in my own skin. when im with my family, im trying to keep up, but i barely feel anything. when im out with friends, i barely feel anything. i feel awful and drained and just want to rot

in my depressive episodes theres not a day in which i just constantly think about not wanting to be alive, so i dont really know where lowering my meds will lead me to

in case you read this far, thank you.
anyone got personal experience to share with lowering/ stopping your medication even with ongoing depression? 
"
318,I feel like I'm too far gone.,"Sounds dramatic, I know. We've probably all been thinking it at some point.

But it won't let me rest. I'm sure other's have it worse, more traumatic things. More illnesses. Less support. I know, I know. And I know I'm young and there's still ""so much life ahead"".

But I just can't see it. I'm doing everything I can. I'm taking meds. I see a psychiatrist. I'm seeing a therapist. In fact, I've been in psychiatric care since I've turned 10. I'm in a 'care facility' (I have caretakers that see me every day, weekends if i want, who help me with everything). I'm not working. I've dropped out of school because of my mental illnesses. I've been to a day clinic. I've been hospitalised. 
I've cut myself, hit myself, I've gotten excessively drunk, I've starved myself, I've overeaten myself. I've slept away months and forced myself to stay awake for days on end. All trying to cope.

I have no idea where this supposed to go. How many more years am I supposed to waste away like this? I've had no childhood, my father wasn't there often enough and my mother had nothing in her mind other than herself. My teenage years are full of above mentioned coping, in combination with ruthless bullying and a family falling apart. I've been assaulted several times. I always end up with the same people. I've got no one around me anymore. I have given away everything I had hoping what I was giving it away for was getting better. But it never did.

I don't see how I'm supposed to ever live. I have never learned what security is. I've never learned what true love is. I've never learned what stability is. All I know is that no one is there for me. That everyone hates me. My entire life was just me trying to survive. And I hate that i survived. I have no more patience, no more hope. I cannot see how I'm supposed to learn to feel emotions that aren't anger, frustration or sadness. How I'm supposed to not be afraid of everything and everyone. How to not hate myself for every single thing. How to not feel watched by everyone, ready to criticise and make fun of me.

How could you possibly rewire my entire brain.
How could you possibly strip me of my entire personality, my entire experience, my entire life."
319,lost my empathy,"ever since i was younger, i’ve always been a very empathetic person. i loved helping people, i loved supporting them, i loved helping them stop feeling like shit and the like. but now ever since i started to feel “depressed” (which was about 9 months ago), i stopped caring about everything, including people. my whole life i’ve genuinely wanted to help people (but not in like an over responsible or feeling obligated kind of way). now i cant even extend my empathy. i cant be bothered after my sweet, loving friend told me that shes suicidal (and even attempted once) and so on. i feel like i should do something but i dont know what that is, it came to me so much easier before, you know making people feel better but right now i dont even know what to do. i dont know the right words to say. even if i do something right now its not enough its not genuine. i cant believe i didnt notice, it was painfully obvious now that i think about it. i do not like this, at all. i do not wish to live like this. hence why i wanted to ask if any of you were or are in a similar situation, how did you get over it, how long did it take you to do so, and if you can really recover from depression, you know go back to your “normal self”. hoping for your insights :> thank you!!"
320,I don't know what to do can anyone help me,"Hello everyone, I guess I'll try to write what I'm feeling right now here, cause nobody knows me and nobody will judge me, even though there's anybody who judges me I don't care cause I don't know you.

So long story short I'm 20 right now, all of this went downhill after I lost my mother back in 2015, I didn't even cried not even a day after my mother died I was just 12 back then, so after she died I have to move to a new city and do junior high school there living with my grandfather and grandmother. I got bullied for at least 2 years in my junior high school but then, I'm still able to live and not even feeling sad not even a single day, my father is not a friendly type but I understand after he lost my mother we only talk once in a month when I ask to pay for my school tuition every month. I can still live even with all those suffering I have to take care my little bro, he was just 8 years old back then."
321,"I hate everything and everyone, but for some reason I can't find the courage to just leave?","Honestly I don't know what it would take to finally end it, but sometimes I feel like I'm close. I'm 24 years old man, still live at home with my mom and dropped out of community college after less than 2 years. Working at a job that I really can't stand and doesn't pay well, with the only upside being I'm alone for 99 percent of my shift, so at least I'm not forced to interact with people. I genuinely hate the way I look. I'm morbidly obese and just aesthetically unappealing. I have absolutely no friends at all and can't make any. I've never been in a relationship and will probably die alone. I have no goals nor ambitions, just want to do nothing but sit in my room and rot. Am extremely lazy and weak, can't get out of bed in the morning, much less keep myself alive. "
322,I want to cry but I can't ,I recently lost my job and have been really sad. Things feel like they just keep getting worse and I feel like I ruin everything. I really want to cry right now but can't. Like I physically can't. I have had this problem for a very long time. Like more than a decade. I will feel like I wanna cry or feel like I'm about to cry but I'll never actually cry. However I do actually cry maybe like once a year maybe. Or once every other year. I think the last time I cried was 2 years ago. Is this a normal rate? Do people cry like once a year or less? Why can't I cry? How do I fix it? I don't really know what I expect anyone to say but I just thought I'd post this.
323,Just when you think you're making progress...,"I'm 35. I was working in high tech for almost 5 years when I lost my job. For over a year, I was driving uber to survive. I hated my life.  
I managed to land a contrast with another company, but that is coming to an end and I think I'll be unemployed again.  

I have no future career path. You see, I'm an ""artist"" *snorts (so pretentious what joke). I thought, I'd land an office job, work during the day, write and paint by night. But neither of my careers are going the way I want.  

Moreover, with the economy in the toilet and AI taking over, I can't find meaning in my life anymore. I can't afford to live in my city, even if I had a job that pays x4 what I make now. I'm always going to be on the chopping block at work because I'm low skilled. I'm way too old and stupid to be retrained in anything, it would take too long to get a degree. I don't have an interested in any field. I'm not a people person.  

My only saving grace here, is that I have no serious debt (just a car, which I could sell if I had to), no gf or kids. I can go anywhere, but I have no where to go...  

What should I do with my life and time? I can't just ""get a job"" as I have no skills. I suck at everything.  

Rant over."
324,It’s scary how empty I feel after winding down,I need to always be distracted or entertained and immediately when that goes away I feel nothing. I feel like I’m crazy 
325,Fed up with life,"Fed up with life

I'm just so fed up with life and try to find any  happiness at all. I just don't understand why, after 53 years, I still can't be happy... but rather constantly treated like garbage, hated by everyone I come across, and considered undesirable. I am a good man, treat everyone well, give people attention, but still I feel like crap all the time. I posted my story on here once not long ago, and no one even responded. I just don't really know why I continue trying anymore. After 53 years, I'm tired of trying and honestly tired of living this life. I'm done."
326,Just a lot on my mind ,"It's been a rough couple of weeks so far I'm not gonna lie, not enough to push me to the brink of any suicidal thoughts but enough to just ruin all my ambitions and motivation in life. I'm only 21 and at this very moment I just feel like I'm going through so many different types of grief it feels like it's too much to bear. To start off my last grandparent from both sides of the family was finally put to rest after battling cancer for years just two days ago and of course the whole family was and is still pretty distraught, I've already made amends on the situation so it's not something that keeps me up at night but In the back of my mind I feel like I'm still coping at the fact my last grandparent just died which'll probably turn me into an emotional mess some point soon. The other problem I'm feeling is more or less just something that people my age usually go through which is falling in love, and right now I say it's a problem because we're so far away from each other so whenever we're apart It's like a withdrawal you can say, we're pretty new into the relationship (3 going on 4 months) which is why I feel this way right now but it just breaks my heart in a new way I can't really understand yet. This is my first moment experiencing ""young love"" and it hurts man, I'm sure I'll get better at this with time. And lastly financial troubles, for the last 3 years I've been investing in my dad's construction for his latest house he's bought with the deal being 'When this house is sold I'll either give every penny back or we can use the money you handed me for a new car'. Honestly I really need the car since I work 40 minutes from my job so I went with that but this whole process of patience is literally killing me. I've invested a little over 35k over the last 3 years by myself and Everytime I ask about the house it seems no progress has been made so I'm kinda at a loss weather I continue giving money because he's my dad or just burn the bridge and stop helping entirely and just cut my losses. 
I'm not sure what I want people to say when they read what I'm writing, I feel like I just want someone to listen. It's a lot and the only reason I'm mentioning all 3 is because they're all really happening right now at the same time. I'm sure others are dealing with alot worse so I probably sound like I'm just complaining but I just feel like writing this down helps a bit so why not post it too. "
327,Growing up and feeling stuck ,"I think this might be a universal experience but at 26 years old I’m constantly having to remind myself that I’m not 19. I’m rapidly approaching my 30’s and considered a real adult but I sure as hell don’t feel like it. I hate that I still feel like a helpless child. So many of peers have started their lives; marriage, kids, houses, stable careers. I’m still trying to get my footing and feel so behind. I’m not ready to be as old as I am! I feel so naive about life all the time."
328,"Everytime I came here and try to post something, I always ended up deleting my words.","Title. I don't know. It seems like so many people are struggling much worse than me. Some people didn't even get any support on their post. I feel sorry for these people. I wish I could help them but I'm hurt too.

I feel like I don't deserve any help as much as those people do. I never got harrased, never lost someone I really love. My family is not the best for me but nothing really serious ever happened.

I'm just another universal coincidence, a dude that never asked to be born, and hate absolutely everything about myself since as long as I can fcuking remember. I only struggle with motivation and finding meaning in things. I never did anything for myself because I never desire anything except death. I am suicidal and do have a plan to kms in the near future but that's not the point of this post. In fact, there is no point of of this post. I'm just rambling. I hope everyone gets better."
329,How do I get out of this rut,"I have been at an all time low since the pandemic in 2020. Everyday feels like I’m quarantined, but in my own personal hell. 

The way out is so clear, but my tendencies are so strong that I can’t seem to do anything but work from home, lay on my couch, eat excessively, doom scroll and go to bed. 

I’ve accomplished nothing in the past four years, minus a single job promotion and co-signing on home I pay the mortgage and property insurance on. 

I am single and quite honestly a terrible, distant, disengaged friend, sibling and aunt. 

I just feel so stuck in my ways that there’s no way out. I lack motivation, drive, passion, desire and hope. 

I am in therapy but talking to someone for an hour every 7 days really isn’t do anything for me.

330,Worthless husband ,"We've been married for 4 years now and  I feel I have not provided my family (wife and daughter) the best they deserve. I have been financially struggling since after the wedding (pandemic).  My salary cannot keep up with the needs and I have fallen so far behind on my finances. 

I feel worthless as a husband and a failure to the rest of my family. I feel like their life would be better without my presence. Taking my life would be selfish, especially to my daughter whom I love the most. I just don't know how to cope up, i feel like my wife is losing patience on my inadequacy. The bare minimum I have provided seems to have max out.

I'm lost.

331,I’m afraid of myself ,"{Depressive rant TW: parental abuse, suicide}

I am afraid of myself, I’m writing and drawing a manga, I’m banking on to go big but I know for a fact it would be hard to make money off it in the competitive industry, I fear that everything I’m doing is a waste of time, I’m not gonna tell my parents about my manga because my parents are manipulative and try and change my dreams. Often times they abuse me. Verbal, mental, emotional and they take away food when I tell them how I feel about anything. I guess I’m suicidal cause I don’t care, if I don’t eat and go hungry that’s fine. If I die that’s ok. I should probably buy my own food anyways I’m an adult. My parents do want to adopt 2 boys though. From the way my parents talk and act half the reason is because I’m such a failure. I’m glad ima have 2 brothers soon, but I fear for them. Will they be subjected to the same shit I was. Probably worse because my parents would strangle someone screaming at them to breathe rather than actually let them breathe. Often times I think about jumping off high point of my university. The school of art in my university have very open spaces I can jump and die. But What happened after that? I know my friends would be pissed. The guy that “prides” himself in helping some of his friends out of suicide, dies from suicide. Talk about hypocrisy. My biggest dream is to see my mangas ending animated, but I don’t even know where to go to get the start animated. It’s a shame my life is being held together by such a childish dream. Ive never have a girl and I’m wishy washy about having one, like I just want love in bursts not constant. I’m in college and I have no idea what I want to do in life except my manga. Other than that. Nothing.  I’m literally wasting thousands of dollars. I’m late with a number of bills both my Shaw and roger bill is so late I can’t receive call anymore. I don’t have a stable job and I can’t look for an actual better one because of my classes at uni. I have faith in god but where is he now these days, I’m battling with lust obviously. I watch porn everyday. I hate how I look, I’m short and most girl don’t even look my way, but I hate it when people look at me.

On top of that I am so busy all the time and it just makes me want to shrivel up and die. Every notification on my phone causes me stress, every second I’m running back and forth between things I scheduled and imposed on myself and cant be taken back. 

I want to cry all the time. My dreams stress me out   I dont want to sleep because I know there’s nothing for me in it and yet I know it deprives me of crucial sleep. I have drifted apart from my friends because of how busy we all are and it feels horrible when the only time we see each other is in class. 

I wish I could just stop but I gotta graduate and I somehow have to get more experience.  
"
337,Idk,It's been 3 years but I'm still haunted
338,My feelings ,I could die but i don’t want to I just want to get better. What if you die it really just goes black and there’s no heaven. drugs seem like a good way to feel better but I want to naturally feel better not something that will temporarily heal all of the pain 
339,Most things I do recently just feel like ways to fill in the time,"I guess the title explains it mostly. Rather than having any long term goals or activities I can turn to derive enjoyment out of it all just feels like a way to fill in the time before my life reaches it's natural conclusion. I'm not too invested in anything and I really lack a sense of purpose. Every time I try to give myself purpose career wise or through other things it merely feels like I should do them rather than because I want to do them. There are things I should care about like I have a pet lizard but I don't find myself caring or being interested in him that much. The one exception is that I really enjoy spending time with my friends however I also feel incredibly lonely and that I'm completely unloved, real fun dichotomy that one. I guess I more or less feel like an NPC at this point, I've been going to therapy for 2 years now and nothing feels like it has changed. Maybe antidepressants will help so I'm going to give them a crack soon. "
340,I can feel it closing in on me and I dont know if there's a way out of it this time.,"I've struggled with depression since my childhood.

I'm 27M, I spent most of my life on a cocktail of antidepressants.

This is the longest I've been without any. At the start of these last 4 years I stopped taking them since my life started to become the best it had ever been. Until it slowly became so much worse all over again. I was being medicated for adhd most of those 4 years. Now I stopped taking everything.

I haven't even been drinking alcohol anymore, I thought the only way out of this was clarity.  
That I needed to be completely clear in my mind. I try so hard to go to sleep early, wake up early, have consistency in my life and get my head back above the surface, but now I just lie awake all night in bed, thinking of all the things I could have done better. Every night I think about my ex. I cant help it. I'm never really asleep. Thoughts of her drift into dreams and back into conscious thoughts but im always half awake. 

I wake up crying, sometimes happy tears, but they always end sadly when I realize she isn't there. I've tried sleeping on her side of the bed, and even on the couch so that my brain doesn't trick itself into thinking that things are like they used to be. 

I'm working out, eating healthy, trying to do everything I've learnt from therapy over the years, but it's not working. I use my inhaler more often than I smoke cigarettes now and I can still barely breathe. 

I know I dug myself into a corner this time. Debt's are catching up to me, everyone in my family is going through there own hardships too.  
Throughout my life, ever since my first depressive episodes, every time I'd overcome them, I grew stronger, or so I told myself. I'd become better equipped to deal with those hardships. 

No matter how much better I got at dealing with it, even at the best of times, there was always a persistent uneasy feeling like a dark draping entity was working in the background, learning how to sabotage my progress, learning how hide seeds of chaos throughout my life so they should all flourish in crushing unison to bury me under myself when my weakest point had finally been reached.

I'm suffocating under the debris of that destruction now and I'm not strong enough to dig myself out whole this time. It's warm under here surrounded by the memories of her love, but even those memories have thorns.

I've been bleeding out for too long. I cant wake up anymore. 

I know it's the end now. That's all I know now."
341,escitalopram,"i just got diagnosed with severe depression. my doctor recommended me 10mg of escitalopram and i wanted to know any side effects, advice or experiences about this medication. 

i’d greatly appreciate your help. i’m new to this and i’ve been researching but diff perspectives would be a benefit. "
342,Growing suicidal due to existential thoughts.,"It's the concept of an eternal void, and the impossibility of true nonexistence. You see, true nonexistence would imply the absence of not only everything, but everything ever. Nothing could've ever existed, and nothing has or will ever exist. The fact something exists now negates the possibility of true nonexistence. A void can, and will eventually be left in place of our current existence, and that void would be eternal.   
Throughout eternity would it not be possible, even plausible, for that void to lead to the emergence of new phenomena or realities over vast stretches of 'time'? This raises another question: Can consciousness be structured in an infinite amount of configurations? If not, it is certain that we'll be reincarnated an infinite number of times. Forced to live out an infinite amount of paradises, an infinite amount of hells, and everything in between.  


Knowing this.. it's as simple as taking my own life and starting over."
343,I (20F) feel like I'm never going to be loved because of the way I look :(,"Hi! ❤️ This is my first time making a post on here so apologies if it's a little scattered. No one around me knows the true extent to how I feel and it feels like I'm going through it all alone.  


I've never felt this low about my appearance and self-image. Looking into the mirror makes me feel disgusting. Nobody knows that I've started to restrict calories (except for a new therapist I've started seeing) and my family think that everything's all okay. I feel like I have nobody to talk to. I miss the way that I was before - I miss eating and not caring about the outcome. I miss looking into the mirror and feeling beautiful. I miss looking into the mirror and even feeling neutral about myself.  


I think that people who come into are eventually going to leave - specifically in regards to relationships. It makes dating online impossible because I feel like once they see me in real life, or get to know the 'real' me, they'll leave. Like I'm so disgusting that I'm not capable of being loved. I guess this is amplified because I experienced something like this last year, where someone I could see myself falling in love with just stopped talking to me one day, and then moved on to someone else a few weeks later. My self-image was already falling then, but from them on it's gotten so much worse.  
Today a new guy I was speaking to randomly just ghosted me - I know it's not a big deal because I didn't know him very long at all, but it's feeding into the idea that I'm not capable of being loved. Like everybody is going to leave eventually, and it's only a matter of time. I hate that I want to be loved so badly, but I think I just want someone to see the positive in me, the positives I'm finding impossible to find in myself.

  
The idea that someone could find me attractive is so disgusting to me I don't think I could ever imagine it - I would just wonder why they do and why they don't go for someone better. I can't see myself in a relationship but I want to experience love. I feel like I'm going to be alone for the rest of my life.

  
I don't really know what I'm asking for in this post, but maybe some reassurance. I feel so alone. I feel like I'm at war with my body and it feels impossible to just exist. I miss the way that I was before."
344,Is it normal to shift from feeling numb to sad and it doesn’t stop?,"I fit the full criteria for depression, and I’m aware that emotional numbness is common in depression. I guess I just don’t know if I’m experiencing it. I’ve read the symptoms for emotional numbness/ emptiness and I completely relate to them all but it’s not constant. It lasts a couple minutes sometimes hours maybe a couple days, but then I suddenly start crying or feel the urge to cry, but no tears come out or I start feeling incredibly sad, maybe anxious because I struggle with anxiety or angry because I think about how hopeless my life is and various other things. I guess I just keep shifting from those moods to feeling empty again, it’s just not constant but it doesn’t stop coming back out of nowhere. Sometimes I can’t even tell if I feel okay or numb, I just imagine something that would usually make me happy and realize that I couldn’t care less about it, but if I start dwelling on my thoughts for too long I start feeling a bit sad, but it goes away after a second and my mind just goes blank or I stop feeling again. It really depends on the day, some days it’s hard for me to feel, others I still feel numb but it can be broken pretty easily. And other days I spend the whole time feeling every negative emotion under the sun. I don’t know what’s wrong with me."
345,I don’t know what to do,"I feel this applies to the emotional neglect I experienced. I just need…

My friends are really supportive, nice, and kind, but still, I feel I need to keep up this persona for them. If I trauma dump or seem like I’m too much—even though they’ve never told me—I worry it’s only a matter of time before they will. I fear I will eventually lose them because I’m emotionally needy, or at least I think I am. They’ve never mentioned it, but I know in my heart they think it. I’ve been friends with some for 4 years, another since 2016, and one has been my friend since the 9th grade. But no matter what they say, I will always be scared they secretly hate me. My therapist said I try to control everyone’s perception of me, so I create a persona in hopes that they will like me. I just feel I’ve already burdened them with so many of my problems, they don’t need more stress or for me to be needy. I told her I bought them something for being too much for them. She asked, “Have they ever taken it and said yes, you are a lot?” I said no, and she said, “There you go.”

I still get so scared.

I’m really scared to admit this to anyone, but I really just want to be hugged and to let someone let me cry on them while I wonder why I’m like this, why nobody loves me, or why I can’t accept that people actually love me and want me to be myself. I just really need this.

I feel I want to tell them this, but I’m so scared. I don’t know who I am anymore. 


Update I told one friend"
346,My thoughts within the last few weeks.,"This is all unedited. 

I’m sorry but I can’t handle this shit anymore. It feels easier to end it than to get help.
I’m supposed to not want to “kill myself” this weekend.. but yet I sit here wanting to.. Idek what’s wrong with me at this point. Also cuz there’s nothing anyone including myself can do to save me. I will not be ranting to my fp or social media anymore. I rather keeps this to myself for now on. I honestly plan on most likely ending my life Monday, and I’m telling anyone. Also why am I not happy high/drunk. I just feel worse. I feel like I’m just trapped in my thoughts/mind. Why am I like this? Why do I feel this way. Why does it have to be the ending of my life, but I honestly don’t have a choice. 

It sucks when it feels like your fp doesn’t care, the one person you want to care the most. I feel like i pushed her to far, that’s why I don’t listen to people when they say I need to talk to people especially friends about how I’m feeling 

It’s kind of funny that when I was drunk I was thinking about the future and really trying to plan it to figure out how to make my life better. But now that I’m crashing I’m back to thinking about “giving up” I can’t keep living like this, and I can’t say that everytime I’m drunk I’m feeling better bc a lot of the time I’m sad and overthinking drunk, but I don’t want to have to be drunk all the time to feel okay. 

My mental health is so bad rn I really don’t know what to do anymore. Cutting doesn’t even help anymore 
 
I think it’s inevitable tbh. I think it just has to happen. I’m sick and there’s nothing I or anyone else can do to fix that 
Honeslty think I’m gonna end it soon. Nothing makes me feel alright. And I’m not telling anyone either cuz theyll try and stop me or just make me feel bad about it.I just feel so goddamn alone.
Ik I said it a couple of weeks ago but hopefully Monday will be the day.

I was right downers make me feel way worse and like shit uppers make me feel so much better. Now I want more which is what I was told would happen so.
I feel absolutely disgusted with myself.."
347,Im not scared of ending it,"
I’m about to buy a gun to kill myself. I’m not really scared of death.

I just have to keep asking myself the important questions.

What do you have to look forward to?

Nothing.

Have you ever been happy?

No

Have you ever had any friends? Have you ever been in a position where you thought you could make real friends?

No

Do you have people that you would feel comfortable talking to? Do you have people that you would want in your life?

No

Are you willing to put an effort into changing yourself?

No

Are you open to believing that your life wasn’t a series of scripted interactions, with a bunch of randos pschoanalyzing you in the bg waiting to see if you full on commit to the delusion or just fucking kill yourself?

No

Are you ready to fight against your body’s physical reaction to imminent death.

Yes. It’s like being nervous before a Big Test or Tryouts or an interview. Hearts going to pound, mind is going to race, you just got to execute through it."
348,Looking for support,"I’ve been fired from my job. I was missing too much time due to mental and physical health. I feel so lost, so upset and numb. Not sure how I’m going to pay my bills. Ruining my relationship. So fucking lost "
349,Rant,"I hate the self pity and annoying feelings, ultimately it's my own fault. I can blame child hood traumas and neglect, or abuse, or anything. But it's me. My actions, or lack of. 

And it makes it harder because I can't stop feeling this way. Like I'm constantly drowning, and people are watching and laughing at me as I gasp. Waking up to nothing, and going to bed feelings of wasted time. Fault of myself alone. 

I write this as I drink, I don't know why, I hate myself more, uneventful never. Therapist said it was survivors guilt, but I think it's escalated. I've been losing sleep. I don't eat right, and I feel fucking stupid as I read over this post. Same pity shit, I wish I could cry but do remember how. "
350,I think it's bad,I don't think I'm ok. I feel like I'm in the middle of a tornado. I'm waiting for it to end but it never ends. it just gets bigger and bigger. And I try to escape the tornado by running away but it turns out I'm the tornado and I destroy everything in my path. But I don't know I feel better than usual too in a way. I just wanna vent or talk. I think it's important for me right now to share before I get lost too deep within myself. Thanks.
351,"Everbody wants something out of me but when I need help, those same people never have it. I just don't know","It's everything all at once. My mom just asks back to back to back and i want her to eat. I pay bills, i helped pay her rent. I haven't talked to her and two months and the first message she sends back is ""hi do you happen to have $20 to eat mommly loves you call me""

Followed 30 mins later by a friend asking for money. Never has it back. She can asks for my yarn while in the same text stating she just brought a huge bag from walmart while im telling her i cant pay rent. Nobody ever reciprocates the same. I just wanna say fuck it and cut everyone off and just go to sleep and never fucking wake up.

352,Feeling down lately ,I’ve been trying to stay busy and distract myself. It’s seems to be the only thing helping.
353,Im drowning,"Been struggling really bad with mental health. My depression has been really bad can barely get out of bed when im at home, ive been self harming alot again aswell. I was getting groomed for over a year by my teacher and just recently am I trying to move past it which is destroying me because although he groomed me he was everything to me. Lost my mom a little over a year ago and she was my reason for living. I havent talked to my dad in months because he was very abusive and minipulitive. Also ive been trying to stay in contact with my friends but it seems like recently it has been 1 sided, im always their for them when they want to talk and im always asking if they want to hangout. But no one ever asks me how I am unless I bring it up first. I have been so depressed/lonely for so long now that I dont try to run from it anymore. I listen to super depressing music all the time and day dream to distract myself from the mental pain. Im sober from drugs and in therapy now which is good though. Anyway I wish you all the best and remember to keep on fighting! <3"
354,I need to vent,"My depression has been significantly worse for several months. I've known for a while my medication was not helping as much as it used to. I stopped seeing my therapist regularly and have totally lost interest in everything I love. I am no contact with my only family member due to childhood emotional abuse and neglect. 

I reached back out to my therapist recently and told him the brutally honest truth that I'm really bad right now. He recommended I speak with my doctor about a med change. I tried getting an appointment and they couldn't see me for over two weeks and recommended I go to the ER. I'm not doing that. I work in the same hospital I'd have to go to. And besides that I don't feel like it's an emergency room situation. I just want help with my meds. 

I have a coworker who is over the top obnoxiously happy. She recommended I use a gratitude journal and ""turn that frown upside down"". I am not even kidding. This made me so upset. It's like some people can't even understand this feeling isn't a choice. A gratitude journal is not going to make me feel better. "

I feel like my depression scares people off. sometimes even before they get to know me they can like sense it or something? or maybe they see i wont put up with bs and get scared. the thougth of being alone forever scares me. believe it or not im a goodlooking, smart girl but my whole life havent made the best decisions with people, for some reason I attract the worst men. its like a curse and it drives me insane to know this is all I attract, even the ones who seem good are horrible to me eventually.

where do i go fromhere? should I leave dating apps for good and stop hoping that a man I want will like me? seriously it's such a rollercoaster and I am crumbling;. please advise thank you..."
356,"3 years of therapy, meds, I'm still fucked up","No relationship ever, I'm almost 30. Job is miserable, I hate it. It pays well but I don't care about money.

357,what you guys do to feel better about yourself?,"Hello, i'm 21 F and i've always hated the way I look, I hate myself and don't know if it ll change, I want it to change, but dont know what to do or how to do it.

I spent my whole life dealing with this and it affected me in many ways, I accepted that no one will love me and that I can't make friends. But I want to change, I can't take the crises anymore, I can't take looking in the mirror and feeling like shit. Every time I feel like I'm changing, someone comments on my appearance and I feel miserable again. How did you manage to live with that? how did they change? (sorry for my bad english) "
358,Scared of myself ,"23M , I’ve recently been very depressed again, and a lot of suicidal thoughts. I’ve tried when I was a teenager, but now this is different and it worries me, because I am not scared at all to do it. Like I know for a fact I will follow through fully. Everyone’s got their responses of change this, focus on that, talk to someone. I’m burnt out. Done. This depression cycle is awful. I don’t want to even stay for the ups anymore. Sick of every up down and in between in life. Basically I’m typing this worried about how close I am during these episodes, as I just went through it "
359,What to do when you’re so crippled with pain and fear to go on? ,"I’ve been depressed a long long time but I live for my friends and family. However much I do hate them, part of me resents them for being human and not wanting me to off myself. And I feel I can’t open up to any of them because they all either get weird or don’t keep what I say between us. And now my business where I worked for the past several years is closing and I just… I don’t know what I’m gonna do.

I like to imagine myself in an idealized life, and it’s not much different. I’m just never me, I’m somebody  else, somebody skinny, self loving, and outgoing. Somebody who has the energy to change the bed sheets more often, or have a license, and a girlfriend… but  Instead I’m a fat fucking loser who is gonnna die alone by his own hand, because I’m broken, and who nobody seems to genuinely care about deeper than “my family, or my childhood friend” I’m just so sick of being me.

I don’t want to do any of this anymore I’m gonna be out of a job, I’m already fucking broke, and i honestly just want to die. I dream about riding into the forest and walking in between the trees and just killing myself. Just ending it, it’s all I want, I don’t want anything else.

I’m terrified the future holds nothing good, even when I’m surrounded by people I trust, or like, I still am filled with pain and fear, fear of the future, fear of complete failure, fear of dying having never been in love. And I hate how important any of it is to me. I fucking hate it all. What the hell do I do? I’m terrified of something as simple as having a normal job, or driving a car, or having to talk with anybody really. I’m just so lost… and I really don’t want to live anymore and haven’t for a very long time."
360,Medicating with Nyquil,"I'm trying to sleep fast so I don't think about the pain. This is the second time I've put myself to sleep with nyquil without being sick. I just don't want to think about my life while I am in bed. I've searched ways to make nyquil stronger. I'm worried I'm going down the wrong path. I'm afraid. I was planning to work on my Masters degree in the health field but, I don't  have the motivation anymore. Everything I've worked for, seems to be collapsing around me. I don't know how to get through this pain and sleep. I don't want to do this. I am usually up until 4am and I have to get up at 6am. I can't take this anymore. I don't know what to do with myself. I'm tired of people playing games with me and wasting years of my life. I'm just used and feel like a failure. This has happened before and it was a hard time, I started having pain in my chest from the stress. I worry its happening again and everyday, I feel pain in my chest, palpitations. Thinking I could die of a broken heart. I feel my heart getting weaker. I feel weaker in every way. I am of no benefit to anyone. There is only two people who keep me holding on to this life and also the fear of going to hell."
361,I'm crying inside right now.,"Sometimes I just cry out loud alone because it's too hard for me. I feel like I was robbed my all chances and happiness, things I should have.
I'm not asking I should be rich or something. I didn't even have very basic things that everyone had. 

Life is survival and alone, people say that a lot of times and I agreed that. But now, I just feel like the world only be crucial to me and other people like me. 

I tried and fought, but it feels like my journey was nothing at the end. My whole life has been denied. Yeah. That is my fault but I was trying to fix my life that already destroyed once by poverty since childhood. 

I can't get out the feeling it's too late to fix that. 
People might say I don't deserve what I want but I do want what I've been dreaming of for life and make it mine Yeah. I will try hard for that, but I'm so messed up. I can't overcome traumas created from failures."

364,Being told to smile ,"Has anyone here experienced being told to smile by either friends, family or total strangers? 

I was depressed and tired at work one day when a coworker told me “smile, why do you look so angry?” 
He even mocked me by doing an impression of how he thinks I look. I felt genuinely hurt because I was not feeling well and shouldn’t have to fake being happy.

People often judge me for the way I look but it stings a bit more when it’s a bad day with only 2 hours of sleep and constant anxiety…"
365,Everyone around me,"Closed my business of 17 years with my brother because we both felt burnt out and I had a nervous breakdown, I'm trying recover but still struggling with anxiety and depression, my brother is struggling a little with depression.

366,"People who struggled with depression and were able to recover, what advice would you give to my friend?","My friend has been struggling with depression and feeling lonely and empty recently. They opened up to me through text and said “i felt my heart suddenly drop during dinner and i started to go numb. idk, my feelings went away if that makes sense. like when you guys were talking during dinner, i didn't feel anything. i had to act like i was completely fine so i tried so hard to remember how someone would react to this word, convo, and action and act it out. my body started to shake too. i went to the bathroom to break down but i couldn't get it out. i feel lost and numb like im in a void.”

I really don’t know how to reply and help. But I really want to. What would you do to help?"
367,I don’t how much more heartache I can mentally and physically take. TW mentions of DV,"I don’t know where to start. I’m hurting so bad I’m physically ill, but I haven’t been able to eat more than a couple bites of food in the past five days, so I’m vomiting stomach acid. The only thing I’ve been able to do is sleep more than 12 hours a day and binge watch Brooklyn 99 in attempt to have something to smile about. Unsuccessful. 

I called the cops on the person I’ve been with for more than four years for physically assaulting me. It happened after both of us having too much to drink and then getting into a stupid argument. One thing led to another and I ended up with blood all over my face (rubber guard on my glasses broke and gouged my eyebrow) and his hands around my neck. I have awful bruises all over my body, including my face. Today was my first day back to work, and the looks from my coworkers/guests (I’m a server) were too much. I felt like I was going to throw up over every single one of my tables, or burst into tears at any moment.   
   
I feel so fucking alone and heartbroken. This wasn’t how it was supposed to be. We had dreams of owning a home soon. Maybe starting a family. We enjoy so many of the same activities together. My mom is constantly texting me and sharing prayers, which makes me feel even more alone because I’m not religious (she knows this). She said at one point “life isn’t always easy”. As if I didn’t learn this from her divorce I went through as a child, my brother dying, and me not finished college as a result of the depression I went into immediately. My dad barely talks to me. My friends are doing the best they can, but I feel like I’m a hole. Every time I think I’ve cried all the tears I possibly can, more come. Every time I eat I throw up. Every time I sleep I dream of him, good and bad.   

I went to Lacasa (idk if that’s like, a state wide thing, but where I live it’s a facility for support for domestic abuse, child abuse, etc) and they provide free therapy. I should have been in therapy long ago. I was never a heavy drinker until my younger brother died from an accidental shooting six years ago.   
  
Everything fucking sucks. Even the cat is depressed. For some reason it’s been easy to sleep the past few days, but tonight I feel anxious. It’s hard being in here in the apartment with all these things that remind me of him. I hate this stupid bed without him. I hate everything that happened. I hate myself.   
  
We can’t talk because the court issued a no contact order. He was here a couple days ago with a deputy to collect his belongings. They only gave him 15 minutes, and we weren’t allowed to communicate. He asked the man if he could ask me a question. Officer said no. He asked again a couple minutes later and I told the officer I was fine with it, but he said the judge wouldn’t be okay with that. I didn’t want to do this to him, I love him so much, I know if we had both been sober it would have never happened. I miss getting texts from him while I’m at work, and like an idiot I kept checking my phone tonight. I miss his smile and the way he always makes me laugh. I miss having him come home excited to talk about his work with me. My mom insisted on taking me out to dinner, and I completely lost it when she suggested the wing bar up the road that him and I would always go to.   
  
I drove home from work in silence instead of listening to music or calling him to say I’m on my way home. Sat in the driveway screaming and crying for several minutes.

369,"I don’t think my life will ever get better, bad things won’t stop happening. There is no hope…","
For some of us everything we want will either never happen, or if it does it’ll end up being disappointing. That’s life for some of us. 

I won’t go into detail but I’ve seen the misfortune my parents have and continue to have. I see how my life has played out, I’m losing hope. 

Bad things won’t stop happening. I can’t imagine how horrified the me from elementary and middle school would be. He’d probably end his life. 

I’m 21, I can’t imagine another 40 or 60 years of this. I hope I get an illness and die within a year from now, to me that’ll be good luck.

371,"Anyone here feel like they need a living, breathing soul to connect with about suicidality?","I'm going through something where I feel like I need a real human being to connect with face to face who has gone through suicidal ideation or has had an attempt... why? We're so alone on this planet and not everyone has such depth of emotion to experience this. As I stare at my screen while I type this, and the cursor blinks in and out, it's like each blink I'm staring into is emptiness; a black hole. If we can share each other's stories, we become stronger together. We learn and grow and find comfort knowing that we aren't alone in these feelings. So many others can say we aren't alone in this. But it isn't until someone truly knows what it's like to sink to rock bottom and toy with the idea of removing one's own life from the physical presence on out planet. I need a living, breathing soul to connect with about this face to face. So I can learn and grow and perhaps help others who deal with the same demons. I'm also looking for some sort of deeper answer as to why I should continue to live. To find my true happiness. Maybe there's greater insight that exists. Or maybe there isn't. Anyway, anyone else feel this way?"
372,Sexual Assault Ideation?,"I [M20] have struggled with my mental health for some time now, and since it started getting worse in 2018/19, I started having thoughts that follow a similar pattern to suicidal ideation, but are about me getting sexually assaulted. It's usually about me ""deserving"" (negatively) to be raped by someone, which is very repetitive. I have been sexually harassed by a 40-ish year old man in the past, and has drunk sex with a man who was sober at the time. Are there any similar experiences to mine? I wanted to talk about this but I feel ashamed to, especially considering I have many girl friends who have experienced actual sexual assault and rape in a scale much more violent than I did."

I just can’t understand where I went wrong to continually be confronted with situations that cause me so much pain. Nothing helps. "
374,Can tolerance to an antidepressant fade over years?,"While varying my medications (both antidepressant and anti-high blood pressure) with a PN's aid to try to Deal With my pesky dry mouth, I thought I might try to switch from escitalopram *back* to sertraline. I'd last taken sertraline at least seven years ago, so I thought that maybe, after all this time, the tachyphylaxis for it will have waned.

Two or three weeks into full sertraline, I'm no longer certain my hypothesis was merited. *Hopefully* my dulling is just from the very recent transition from escitalopram (and witnessing a particularly unpleasant political snarling), but I'm worried I was on a fool's errand to begin with.

The good news is that I still have a reserve stock of escitalopram. So if tachyphylaxis can't wane, I still have the previous medicine to return to."

376,unsure of TMS and feeling attached to my depression. ,"I’m still on my parents insurance and have been struggling with a bad depressive episode since September. I’ve been depressed since I was 11 and I’m 19 now and am diagnosed with MDD, dysthymia, and I think seasonal depression (it’s been a bit since I’ve looked at my records). My mom suggested TMS which is covered by our insurance for the most part, and I’ve had friends who had the treatment and it worked well for them. 

The thing is, idk if I actually want my depression to go away completely? Idk who I am without it. Sometimes I wish I was still 11 and I didn’t know why I was sad or what was happening. I’m medicated and they work, but i haven’t been able to feel positive since my meds make me numb/ neutral (better than suicidal). What if It takes away a part of me. I hate it and how it makes me feel, but I’m still scared of losing my depression. It would help a lot since my depressive episodes can trigger my psychosis or mania, and I hate feeling suicidal- but, sometimes I like rotting or being numb. It hurts but it reminds me I’m alive and human. What if I can’t feel like me without my mental illness? I’ve spent so long feeling isolated due to my symptoms, what if people don’t like me when I don’t have them. What if the problems stay the same and it was for nothing. I have so many other issues to focus on. Im nervous it’s bad for me to think this way. I already am upset with myself over a plethora of things, I don’t wanna make things worse. 

I just hope I’m not the only person who is attached to their depression in a way that (I think for me at least) is unhealthy. I feel bad but don’t have any friends I can really talk too. Just my family and I don’t like making them worry "
377,How to “break up” with a therapist?,"I feel like my therapist is really not helping me with my mental health issues. I mean…she’s alright to talk to for an hour every week, but it’s just not worth the time and money. She is the only person outside of work that I speak to, period. However I am a very solitary person by nature and have been in the position of having no one in my life more often than I *have*, so that is not a huge concern for me. The problem is that I feel too bad to break it off. I’ve been seeing her for about three years every week and I feel like I would owe her an explanation at this point. Some of the issues I DO need help with are standing up for myself, being assertive, saying no, initiating difficult conversations, etc. and my inability to “fire her” is a perfect example of that, and how I have not advanced in the slightest in those areas since beginning therapy with her. What do I do? How do I end it?"

382,Got my dream job in my dream city and I’m still depressed and can’t do it properly. ,"I worked my ass off in college trying to run from my depression. I always had 2-3 jobs at a time and in 4 years I finished 2 different degrees where none of the classes overlapped and Chinese as a minor. Ya know, just to really ensure I suffered. But I pushed through hoping the other end would get better. 

I later was diagnosed with a chronic physical illness that took over my life. I slowly managed to work again and to manage my symptoms. Eventually I got a decent job that propelled me to try law school. I entered law school in the fall of 2019. Spring 2020 everything went remote. My depression got worse and I barely passed. But I pushed through hoping the other end would get better. 

I got into a relationship in 2017. COVID nearly broke us. But I pushed through. The other side with this person had to be better. 

The bar exam was the worst thing I have ever experienced relating to feeling the stress physically in my body. The three days before the exam I was so stressed out I experienced one never ending panic attack to the point where I thought I’m either going to pass the exam or literally drop dead trying. I think I’m still recovering and probably have a baby dose of PTSD from the experience. I pushed through hoping the other end would be better. I passed by the skin of my teeth. 

By sheer luck and privilege I managed to find a great mentor who got me my dream job in my dream city despite my mediocre GPA. I moved to a place with decent healthcare for my chronic illness. My partner and I are now long distance while they find a job to move out here with me. I get to do the work that I loved every day with incredible attorneys showing me the way. And I’m still depressed. 

The problem is, it’s now affecting my ability to do the dream job. I butchered my last oral argument because I just couldn’t bring myself to prepare enough. I’m on my third day off work “sick” because I just can’t. I’m already chronically late because I can barely get out of bed most mornings. If I don’t go in tomorrow I’m sure I’m risking my job. The very thing I pushed so hard to get past to achieve my
dreams is now physically preventing me from doing the dream job. I’m so terrified that maybe I can’t be an attorney after all. And it wasn’t because I wasn’t smart enough or didn’t work hard enough. It’s because I’m depressed. And it’s bullshit. "

392,How to get over the hump of having absolutely no motivation.,"I’m almost 28 years old and I’ve wrestled depression and anxiety for most of my life (ever since I was about 11). But this slump of lacking motivation to do the basic things like sleep, shower, and eat are the heaviest burdens I can’t seem to build a sustainable habit out of.

Am currently medicated for anxiety (Escitalopram 20mg) and have been in and out of therapy most of my life. I am a pretty self-aware guy, but just looking for “hacks” or tips and tricks to help motivate myself to push through the seasons with absolutely no motivation. Pretty sure I’m adhd too, but don’t want to self-diagnose.

Any help or tips that have worked for you would be much appreciated!"
393,I thought I'd die before I was 21. I'm 25 now and I don't know what to do.,"Growing up, I was convinced I would die before I was 21. Not in a suicide way (though yes, I was suicidal) and not because I was sick or terminal or anything; I thought I was going to die in a car crash. Completely convinced, to the point where I didn't get any driver's license until I was 18. My dad literally had to drag me to the car to practice, and tricked me into driving onto the highway (where I pulled off at the next exit with the worst panic attack of my life). 

The point is, I was always convinced I would die before 21. I even had a deal with myself that I would kill myself before my birthday ""just in case."" It seemed like a long time away when I was 13, when I originally thought of his compromise. But then my 21st birthday happened and I geared myself up to finally do the deed... But I didn't. I don't know what stopped me... fear, maybe?

So the years kept coming. I got some therapy. Not a lot - can't afford it - but I started getting a little better. I finished college, tried to work for a few years, went back to college when I couldn't find work with my degree. I'm no longer actively suicidal; I don't have a plan anymore, but I still consider it on occasion. There are good days, bad days, but mostly gray days, where nothing seems particularly good or bad. 

Functionally, though... I think I'm still waiting to die. I'm not really proactive about anything in my life. I had dreams of writing books for a living, but I can't even work up the energy to keep going. The days keep going by so fast and I feel like I'm wading through molasses, and at any moment I could miss my step and fall up to my neck in my own nonsense. I self-sabotage, I procrastinate, I'm deep in a victim complex that I hate but I keep falling back into because its easier. 

I don't know what to do. I'm still convinced the world will be a better place without me in it. "

I once watched ‘what happens in Vegas’ when I was a kid and a quote from that movie stuck with me… “even your parents, the only people in the world who are biologically programmed to love you and even they can’t fucking stand you”. 

It affected me as a kid, reminded me just how fucking unloveable I am and to this day it still does. Shit I just wrote this cause I saw a video on Instagram about how dads should set the standard high for their little girls and it brought a tear to my eye. I wish my parents or myself was dead… because I can’t go on living without being in distress that we have to all share this world together 😭😭😭"

The issue is there is no loss. There is no situation causing it. A daily battle that you fight just to escape to your bed every night and awake to the same feelings and isolation. Medication, cbt, dbt, meditation, opposite action, Tipp.....how many tools do you need to keep the darkness at bay? Family and friends? Plastic smiles and mustering up all energy to say ""I'm good! How are you today?""  It goes away for months, then years only to return. You think you have outgrown it the medication is working only for it to return. All hope is lost.

I tried in so many ways to avoid her and then to help her.
I just got fucked up.
She cheated on her boyfriend with me.
I tried to hide the truth as I could, but later on some people knew It and I got blamed for that. I was just looking for help and the answers she never gave me.
Someway I ended up being ""the bad guy"" (or the stupid one, who felt something not reciprocal... which wasn't true at the time anyway, but she preferred money over what was happening). So many people are still looking bad at me, avoiding me, or secretely making fun of me after 3 years and It is making me so crazy. 
I realized only few months ago that probably she was a narcissist... she met me when I was one of the best people pleaser in the world.
I had a lot of ups and downs since then, I thought different times that It was not a problem anymore, but here I am.
I tried to stay away from her friendships and changing enviroment, but I live in a very small city and It's almost impossible avoiding It at all.
She used her fake innocence to fuck me up and cleaning her dirty hands on me.
I just hope she suffers as a b**** and dies.

Though I've never felt these things for anyone nor I've ever wanted It... It doesn't fits me at all and It hurts so much feeling obliged to have such feelings.

404,I keep hiding and not living,"I have struggled with depression for the last 20 years. It comes and goes in waves---there are times when I'm really down and out, and then times where I really feel like I'm functioning normally.

Lately, I've come to realize my Iow-key depression that is more pervasive, and that's expressed through this pattern of coming home every night and watching t.v., eating junk food, then getting up and doing it all over again. Even on the weekends when I have time off, I start the day feeling hopeful about all the things I might do, then end up spending hours watching movies. 

I can recognize now that this is also depression---it's the fear of living life, of putting myself out there. It's so much easier and more comfortable to hide, to avoid taking risks or being seen.

I'm at the point now where I'm sick of this. I'm sick of myself wallowing all the time and not doing anything fun or productive. Yet no matter what I tell myself, I can't seem to make a change. It's like my feet are stuck in concrete. 

I want to change. I want to save myself and get better, I want to make healthy choices for myself that make me feel good and bring fulfillment to my life.

I just can't seem to figure out how to do it. How can a behavioral pattern like this go on for years, even when there is the desire to live differently?

It is the worst kind of stuck feeling. 

Has anyone else dealt with this? How did you overcome it?"

406,I just don’t get it ,"I (34 F) have been struggling with depression since I was 11-12 years old. There are times when it’s been managed and I’ve felt better, but the meds never seem to work long term. Recently my psychiatrist upped my Zoloft to 200mg a day, and I feel like I’m even more depressed now. 

Things in my life are going ok, my dad had a health scare which shook me quite a bit, and I am currently unemployed but working on my physical and mental health. For a while I was doing well and walking outside for exercise and sunshine, but now I’m struggling to make myself get up and be active again. On top of all of this I’m having a gastric bypass done in March, which is going to be a kind of full time job for a while by itself.

But anyway, I guess I just wanted to vent and ask others if being down for no real reason more often just happens sometimes? Has anyone experienced increased depression on a higher dose of antidepressants? "

I felt really lonely. 
This time in my life still affects me as an adult. I think too much about me, i always ask myself if the others like me or if they think if I‘m weird or boring.

i used to be pretty great... anxious, clean record but i never took any risks, honors student sort of overachiever i had crippling anxiety and PTSD from growing up lol. i had friends who loved me i think? i didn't have my family but fuck them who needs family. well i do... i actually do need my family more than ever bc i cut off everyone else. been ghosting my friends for 2 months after randomly leaving them but whatever. who needs them. i fucking hated one of them anyway. ugh... i'm 19 soon enough i'm going to be 20 a bum and nowhere to go. i don't even have a community bc i'm not in my hometown i hate it here i'm such a fucking bum my life sucks. i'm too fucking stubborn to do anything here bc why make connections if i'm just going to leave anyway??

i fucking hated moving it literally ruined my life. i think i might kill myself bc i feel like the best years of my life were just taken from me lol or what was supposed to be the most formative years. whatever man.

who am i to hate my parents??? who do i have to blame??? bro my life fucking sucks ass so fucking much is this just normal. life doesn't follow a script does it? i feel like it should. they ruined my life. i hate everything about this place and this life. i didn't even get a fucking chance. i think i'll kill myself in a month. what's the hold up? what's stopping me? god i fucking hate this place so fucking much

maybe i would've ended up like this anyway. who even knows i don't even know anymore. i come from a family of bums like my bum dad and uncles so now i just disappoint my mom even more. sorry mom. maybe you shouldn't have married into a bum family though ... (not serious tho just venting sorry mom i know your life sucks too. i just hate being a reminder of dad but can't i be given a chance i'm just 19 he's a grown ass man with multiple children why can't i catch a break?? i'm sorry you hate me mom you had kids at 17 why couldn't you give me a break just because you had to take on more responsibility?? wouldn't you have wanted a break?? i don't get it mom can't you love yourself and try to love me too i'm not him i don't get it i just don't get it why won't you fix yourself so you can stop trying to fix me why mom why)

(if i killed myself would i be just like him?? so typical of him to do right? do i have no personality of my own. i'm not even my own person am i. that's right. if i believe it will you finally love me for who i am)"
409,This shit sucks. ,"This shit sucks, doesn’t it? I’ve been depressed for well over decade. Only recently it’s been severely more intense and longer lasting. Ordinarily I’d surround myself with distractions to trick myself into forgetting it, but not now. I have everything, anxiety, depression, rumination, insecurities and creating scenarios that have a fraction of a percentage of happening. Usually it’s only 1 or 2 that bother me, lately it’s all 5. I’ve set myself an unattainable bar of expectations and standards for myself but always fall short. 

My wife doesn’t get it, she cannot empathize with me. I’m a 40 year old guy with average male friends who won’t understand either. I’ve toyed with therapy but I think I’m too far gone tbh. It feels like my mind is torturing me, thoughts are slowly killing me. Nothing I can say or do will change it. 

The fucked up part that I feel like I deserve it, like I’m being punished for something. I don’t feel I deserve happiness, only suffering. I’m mentally and physically exhausted from putting on an act. Always the funny guy who loves making people laugh, always “on”, always willing to help others when I can’t even help myself. I was days away from ending it, had it all planned. My wife saw how I was a shell of myself and finally allowed me to open up to her, it was well received. But it keeps coming back. It never leaves. It can be triggered by literally anything. A word, an image, a memory that chains into other memories, a thought. It’s been compiling for years and years. I replay things I’ve said and done that hurt people for almost 2 decades over and over. I feel too much and it’s slowly poisoning me. I’ve never known what it’s like to truly feel loved. 

Not really sure wtf the point of this post is, maybe it’s my way of saying we are all in this shit together and we’re not alone. Maybe it’s just me venting even though I’ve said this almost verbatim before. At any rate, finding someone to talk to is helpful. Just verbalizing it can do wonders. That seems to be the only thing that helps me. Unfortunately it’s at the expense of the people I love. "
410,Something I Want to Say,"Okay, you all know what the furry fandom is? I joined the fandom since I was 12. I had fallen into love with the community and the people, but yes, I was still very young at that time. I did not realize or get to see the bad part of the fandom. 

2 years have passed, and now I've seen everything. Ever since I have been trying to argue against the furry fandom in order to find a way and reform it before anything worse could happen. I want to let people stop being degenerates and act like normal people, but furry. 

I've been stressing on too much of the fandom, I am an artist. I draw a lot of things about the fandom and listing ways on how to change them. Recently, my parents began to wonder if i had been getting into porn or other type of stuff, and they confiscated my electronics. Which is a huge disadvantage since I had already mastered the way to draw.

I now feel like my parents gave up completely on me, and they won't even help me at anything. My grades have been dropping ever since. I don't think this is my problem, it's all because of the furry fandom. I am overwhelmed to change it, I cannot turn back because I had seen already too much to leave the fandom. I have to make them learn what they've done.

It only deteriorated my mental health even more. School, grades, drawing, writing, debating... 

I mean I can just kill myself any time now, but if I die, who's gonna be there to change the furry community? Who's going to show them how son of a bitch they really are?

I can die, but not now. I'm not going to let these bullshit overwhelm me."
411,Too depressed to exercise ,Like wtf?! The one and only thing that helps is the one thing I can't get myself to feel motivated to do. Depression is such a fucking bitch. It just robs me of my motivation and I end up just wanting to sleep. 
412,Life is just a bunch of problems and chores,Life is just a bunch of problems and chores sure you can have happy moments but they are rare the older I've gotten they don't even exist anymore. The happiest I ever was when I was a kid because I was ignorant to the world and all of it's bullshit. I hate when people say life is a gift not for me I want to return this shit and be wiped from existence.
413,Depressed about getting older,"I've been feeling so depressed thinking about the fact I will never have my young milestones like first day of college, high school graduation, being together as a family like with siblings as everyone moves on with their life over time, how I will never get my young years back, how i only have 3 years left till my 30s, how i have no elders left as grandparents on both sides of my parents are dead,how my parents will never be young and energetic again, how my health and looks will continue declining as I'm aging I mean not that it is that good to begin with. I dont have this excuse anymore like i still have few more years left to improve so no biggie so my mistakes wouldnt be as forgivable now and people would judge me like oh, im too old to be doing this.Life will just continue getting depressing as I'm aging. "
414,Orphan,"I’m feeling so abandoned and alienated, as if I’m an orphan. When I was a kid my parents got divorced and mom had left us, and she ended up dying back in 2020, so I’m all fucked up from not having a motherly figure in my life. Also almost all of my friends had drifted away from me, especially a few years ago when I was at my “friend’s” apartment and we all got super drunk and I must’ve blacked out and they literally threw me away in a dumpster because they thought I was dead. I’m guessing it was night time when I blacked out because it was around morning time when I woke up and pulled myself out of the dumpster, while covered in shit and blood because their was broken glass in the dumpster, I to walk 8 miles back to my house because one of my “friends” who was at the party picked me up in his car, and he obviously left the next day. I was never that same after that day."
415,Depressed overseas fiancé isolating and pushing everyone away. Should I visit or leave him alone?,"My fiancé became really depressed over loosing some money. When he’s severely depressed he isolates, drinks too much and barely eats. He ignores everyone, doesn’t reply to texts or answer calls.

At the start of this episode he sent me a breakup text saying he is over the distance and doesn’t like that we could be apart for another two years while we wait for a visa to my country. He didn’t give me a chance to say I’d be willing to move there because he immediately blocked al contact. We’ve been together 3.5yrs and engaged over a year.

I feel like he pushed me away so he was free of all obligations and could sink into doom and gloom alone. I’m not sure it was a serious breakup as he has done this once before when depressed.

No one has heard from him and his mum and I are really worried. I am worried he might also be suicidal. I’m thinking to go and visit, to take care of him for a week or so as he doesn’t have anyone there. I think he would appreciate this but I’m not sure.

I get depressed too but I’m not the type to isolate completely and push everyone out of the way. So I don’t know if a visit might be too much.

What do you guys think?"
416,Small victory!,"I'd just like to take this time out to say that life has been really hard for me the last few months....coincidentally it started getting hard for me when I stopped going to therapy! (Hmm...imagine that!)

Anyways, today, I called my therapist and scheduled myself to have a session with her on Monday, and I'm now about to go shower and get ready for work.

Go me!!"
417,Does therapy actually work?,"My school offered mental assistance and calls will be answered by licensed clinicians. I tried today and she was only listening and summarizing / repeating what I just said. The only advice might be the breathing exercise and I don’t think it makes a difference 

Are therapies like this? I also googled how therapists work, and it seems they just talk you out of your current state of mood. But I mean that doesn’t fix anything right? Even if I feel better, my life is still messed up and I will just be back to where I was emotionally.

I want professional help but I also don’t know what I want. I don’t think anyone can talk me out of my depression and I am scared meds will make my brain worse. 

I want some magic to fix irreversible damages to my life but that’s unrealistic. So am I screwed?

"
418,I'm afraid I'll kill myself,Been feeling very bad all day more than usuall i highly think of ways to kill myself I'm qfraid of myself right now been thinking to stab myself but i would prefer to hang mysef more i yhink but overdosing might be the easiest method bc i got lot's of pills at home and i already tried to overdose once so i have experience with that method so is easier more familiar but I'm thinking about jumping of a building too or getting hit by a car which seems faster death i need to think about it to do reserch
419,I just want to sleep….,"My life has taken such a bad turn that now the only thing I want to do is sleep and forget everything. I also wish that I die in sleep but that never happens. I always wake up with even more depression. Nothing makes me happy, nothing. I really want to sleep forever "
420,I'm so burned out...,"I just can't anymore I feel like I've entirely lost myself. People have noticed the change in me. I never reacted to my childhood trauma until my parents died and ever since I just slowly slipped away. I feel like I'm running in the dark searching for any glimpse of light to grab onto. I've had counseling throughout out my life, but I don't think it works for me anymore. It shouldn't be like this at 40 years old, I should have it together at least a little bit. I have force myself to get up do my hair, makeup, get dressed ect. However, it doesn't get done often I'll get as far as a shower and dressed and that's it. I used to be so much better even through some really terrible things that no one had any idea about. My friend asked me to go put last week and I just couldn't the thought was overwhelming. I hate being in public I feel like everything is a blur and I just want to bolt. Does it ever get better and stay better? "
421,"Living just to work, where is my motivation to keep going?","I’m stuck working a bullshit job for very little pay, barely scraping by, getting by with only eating one meal a day in hopes of maybe being able to save up enough money to actually be able to have some sort of life experiences with my time here, before going back to the grind. This is my life now, I’m a wage slave, working until my body physically gives up on me either from exhaustion or malnutrition, no way out of this hell until I retire (if that ever becomes an affordable option) or die. My work life balance is work, sleep, back to work so I can afford the place a sleep a few hours each night and some coffee to make me function through the work day. The only thing that brings me any motivation is that money I saved by going hungry with that hopefully I can eventually go on a trip so I can experience what it’s like to actually live for a week or two before returning to my life that I hate. There’s not enough antidepressants in the world to make me feel like I wish death would hurry up, I don’t really want to kms but I’d prefer if it would be sooner rather than later at this point."

Like I keep trying and trying, feel like I'm running out of options. Like I know the best thing to do keep trying but lowk wanna give up. 

Tired of not being able to do anything, feeling constantly fatigued, feeling like i'm lazy when I know I'm not because I have so many ambitions and aspirations. I know this seems contradictory seeing as I'm writing this but I went from a straight A student so failing all my classes. I'm wanna feel normal like everyone else.
Like what happens when I run out, am I just screwed?"
423,Going to end it all tonight.,"Six months of sitting down and staring at my phone looking up ways to die. I don’t care how painful at this point I just want to go. I’m miserable. My poor parents have tried everything and I’m a lazy, ugly unmotivated daughter. I either plan on jumping off a building tonight or a plastic bag around my head. I’m scared but this will all be over. I’ve been in therapy for months and just lacking everything, prior hygiene, I haven’t been dressing well at all just wearing crewnecks. I stayed for my nieces birthday. But I just can’t do it anymore. I’m tired of the suffering. Goodbye world. I hope that I find some sort of peace in the afterlife so I can watch over my siblings and family. I just can’t do it anymore. If you’re reading this life will go on. Please don’t do anything I’ve done to end this way. "
424,I felt dead inside ever since I went through that one day...,"I was never on good terms with my parents. When I was a kid they used to beat me and yell at me constantly. I always had to lie that I love them to avoid trouble. At the age of 16, I became severely suicidal, not just because of my family but because of many other things that I don't even have the strength to talk about. During this time I was doing something so stupid I genuinely want to slap myself in the face for: I used to cut myself. It was the stupidest coping mechanism I used because I didn't think about what would happen if any of my family members found out... And they eventually did... One day, my sleeve slightly rolled up and my mom noticed a few scars, I quickly tried to pull it down and act as if nothing happened but she forcefully rolled it up again and saw what I did. 

She told my dad immediately after that. He banged into my room asking me to show him what I did, then he repeatedly kept asking me why I did it. I couldn't respond, I genuinely didn't know what to say. Eventually he started threatening me how he'll punch me in the face if I don't tell him, so I was forced to say something. The words that came out of my mouth were ""because I wanted to kill myself..."", guess what he did? He first started making fun of me, then he started insulting me and my suicidality and was also saying how he does everything for me and how I have no reasons to be unhappy (which is a lie btw). 

He then took my phone away, forced me to walk to the store to buy food and then forced me to read some book about god or something. I tried talking with my mom, I asked her could we talk but the only thing she said was ""do you understand what you did to me today mentally..."" Like ???

My dad eventually came into the room and wanted to talk, I managed to lie about it and said that I actually feel completely okay right now and that I used to do that because I was frustrated and what not. The day afterwards went as if nothing happened and to this day we talk as that whole day never happened. That happened two years ago. To this day I feel ashamed in a way, I feel defeated, I feel like I'm not valid. More and more bad things were happening over time, I genuinely can't take it anymore."
425,Why get better?,"Sometimes I envision myself feeling better, being social, having a positive outlook on life, but then I ask myself, why go to that much trouble getting better?

I will always be pretty stupid and ugly, people I work with will always be crashing bores, I will always be alone, stuck in a useless job with no talents or interest in a career.

Being in a good mood for this kind of life feels like someone who is happy to have lots of money and a beautiful house on the Sims. It has no value."
426,Confused,"Hello, idk why I decided to make a post here but I guess i havent spoke with somebody about my feelings for a long time, maybe it will help.
Im 25m and I feel like ive been dealing with “depression” since I was a child, i was never diagnosed because I ve never been to therapy but I guess thats what youd call how Im feeling.
Its hard even for me to explain but to give you some context, i was raised by an abusive alcoholic mother and an absent father.I actually remember that I used to be happy because I have never experienced something else outside of my family, so basically the  stuff i was going trough seemed normal to me until I grew up, id say 12yo, and started to look around and see other people s life, I think that really put me down, because I started to feel like I am not good enough, not smart enough and I deserved everything that happened.
Right now I dont talk to my mother anymore because she never changed, she is still one toxic woman, my father is living in a different country but everytime me or my sister tried to talk to him and open up about our experiences he never sided with us, he sided with our mother, so i keep a low contact with him also.
Im at a confusing point in my life, I cant really make meaningful connections, I feel sad all the time and it gets even worse thinking this is going to be my life now, since my “mind” hasnt changed in that aspect much, feels like im just waiting for the time to pass and die, cant seem to find joy in anything anymore. 
Has anyone else felt the same? 
"
427,my wife has ruined my life and future,about 3 years ago I was making great money and my wife was working at a well known cable company. my health took a turn and I was diagnosed with a form of congestive heart failure from scar tissue on my heart that formed from an accident that happened when I was 16 (im 31) where I was nearly fried to death by 480v. I had to have an oblation to sever some of the scar tissue that was making my heart beat improperly. any unnecessary strain I put on my body makes the scar tissue grow more so I had to quit my dream job as an arborist and started my own company. we made an agreement that since this was the case she couldnt quit her job or do anything that would jeopardize her position unless she could get all of her credit cards paid off and already had another job lined up. 4 days after i made the transition to running my own company she went on loa for no good reason and dove head first into a bottle. she hasnt paid any of her cards off so I have been paying close to 5k a month in interest absolutely negating any money I was making (she thinks by paying that interest every month that she is building credit) on top of that she has pulled out several loans that I am now responsible for paying by default. she has spent every dime that I had put back to pay my taxes so now the IRS is coming after me. she has refused to find a new job and cant go back to her other one but they wont technically fire her (they want her to resign so they dont have to pay unemployment) i need another operation or im going to die but I cant get it because our health system in the US wont deal with me without the insurance I used to have through her work. Im broke financially and physically and cant even afford to feed my cats and dogs much less pay my rent and she doest seem to care the slightest. I cant even afford a divorce.
428,Husband resistant to SSRI ,"My husband has depression and/or anxiety. He’s unmotivated, melancholy, irritatable and losing his appetite. He has a lot of personal and work stress and just spirals in his own head. This is not new (on and off for years), but as stress grows it appears to be one of our worst bouts. 

I’ve made a dr appt for him, but he’s very, very against any medication in case it impacts his libido. And doesn’t think a therapist will help - he confides in me a lot. What can I suggest to him…non-SSRI meds, supplements etc. I’m desperate - his irritability and melancholy make it very hard for me to carry the load for our family. I need my partner back! "
429,Will things ever truly get better? ,"I’m 30 years old, I was diagnosed when I was an early teen. Over half my life I’ve struggled with depression, anxiety, self harm and suicidal thoughts. Will things ever actually get better I wonder? Life is just so exhausting. "
430,I’m lost.,"    I’m a 34m and have dealt with depression/anxiety for as long as I can remember. When I was 27 I met who I believed was the woman I would spend the rest of my life with. Seven years later she wanted a divorce. I would’ve been ok with that decision if it hadn’t come out of the blue. We had our problems like many couples, but I was under the impression that she and I were working on our issues together.
    She didn’t even have the courage to come out and say she wanted a divorce. It took me to ask “so are we getting a divorce?” And she responded with “I think that would be best.” The weirdest part is when people would ask how we were doing. We would both tell them that we were getting a divorce. I was torn up and really sad about the whole thing. She was going around almost bragging according to some of the friends I had. She was telling people “it’s what we both want” with a smile on her face. I was clear with her that divorce was not what I wanted.
    Fast forward about another month, I find out she’s been cheating on me with a coworker. Even with hard evidence, she denied it. It pushed me to some pretty dark places. All I wanted was for her to admit and acknowledge that she hurt me and she couldn’t do that. I found out around September and continued living with her until just before Christmas because of our son. I moved away to be around family and friends again. I recently got my son back from her.
    I’ve only been away from her coming up on two months and there is no sign of getting any better. I feel completely lost and I’m having to walk around pretending like everything is fine for my son and the other people in my life. I feel like a burden. She ruined my faith in myself and other people. I truly believe that she is a covert narcissist, as her behavior throughout the seven years lines up with those behaviors.
    I don’t know what to do or how to cope. People tell me to that the healing is going to take awhile and seeing as how I’ve dealt with what many people believe to be narcissistic abuse, it could be longer. I don’t see a light at the end of the tunnel and there is absolutely nothing that gets my mind off of it. I’ve tried everything that people have suggested and I can’t clear my head of any of it. Sorry for the long post…I needed to vent."

I don’t have ups at all just steady suffocating depression and anxiety I herniated a few discs and have degenerative disc disease and spinal stenosis along with severe bursitis in my hips.

I never get manic highs, but I battle severe paranoia but a lot of it is justified. Can someone PLEASE advice me on what medications have not caused weight gain for you?

I don’t want to leave the house and I don’t want to open my eyes in the morning bc I find more peace in my nightmares.

433,Dealing with lack of motivation,"Hello, new to this sub. Just wondering if you guys had any advice or tips that you’ve used to “trick” your brain into doing things. Just how you cope with the lack of motivation side of depression. Just a few examples in my life are being late for work every day because I simply cannot get myself out of bed on time. All I can think is ugh here we go again. Another is with my personal appearance. Simply the thought of getting a shower and God forbid I have to wash my hair or shave, just seems like the absolute end of the world. I can’t bring myself to do basic chores like laundry or the dishes because, again, it seems like the most exhausting, daunting task in the world. But on the other hand, I was raised in an environment where if you weren’t doing something or cleaning at all times, you were wasting time and being “lazy”. I also get super anxious and even more depressed living in a dirty house. You can see what a spiral this ends up being. Just looking for any advice on how you guys/gals cope with this.

My girlfreind is depressed, we went long distance because I have school far away, and I feel like we have been just drifting, whenever I ask her if she is ok, or is we are, she gets paranoid. Its so bad, that we went on a three day break, and to be honest it kind of helped, for a few days shit felt back to normal, I even manged to visit, and we were rigth back in that lovy dovy spirit. Then I came back up here, and its worse than ever. I barely manage to get resonses it feels like, sometimes anyway, she still says I love you, and drunk texts me, but sober her is a different story, I can tell that things are just falling apart. we recently called, and she refused to say a word, she just wanted to hear my voice, so I talked, about random cutesy BS, and she would rspond over text, and honestly it was so conflicting, I was glad that she was happy to hear me, but so depressed that i couldnt get the mutual gratification. we called again the next day, and it was so... Awkward. I feel like there is no healthy way this can continue, but at the same time I could see myself marrying her in the future.

I havent ever been suicidal before, but Im really thinking about it so much lately, like this little voice in my head, it tells me to do it. I dont think I will, but Im scared. generally, im such an anxious person, like this never ending knot in my stomach that will never go away. lately, its just gotten worse and worse and worse. I feel like everything I do is destroying everyone and everything around me, my gf is perpetually hurt by my mere existance, I am on a spiral of self destruction, I constantyl lie to my family, i have never missed so many classes in my life. I feel like I've peaked, everything from here on out is the downward spiral, and the only thing that keeps me here, is this never ending, feeling of a narccistic importance, that I will do something that everyone will be helped by. Some sort of weird motive that pushes me to not die, but to hate living as well, like i will somehow rally thousands of people to pull the lower classes from their never ending misery and into the new age. Honestly, for so long I couldnt figure out what my deal is, but I'm just crazy. and depressed. two things that go hand in hand. is there anything i can do to fix any of this? do I just have to live in constant pain, what steps should I take? do you any of you relate to any of this?"

i feel so distracted with my schedule and i can't feel the same enthusiasm i used to feel when i first started working ....

so to give a context , back in 2021 I passed my high school with a decent scoring although I'm average at studies . after high school I enrolled in B.A English (hons) from a good university but the thing is i really didnt choose my graduation subject wisely at the time it was mainly under the influence of friend suggestions and english being one of the subjects in which i scored highest in my high school and even though the first semester was kinda fine i was coming to a realization slowly i don't like the subject itself .

also during my first year of college , my family's financial condition went really downhill ... So with the help of some loan , family and friends and a business partner , me and my mother somehow managed to open a small dance studio on our own because at the time we really thought it is one of the easy businesses to do , doesn't require much capital to run and also because we had a business partner to guide us for further steps

i guess that this was one of the turning points in my life cause i really love dancing but before the studio it was more like a hobby since my family always gave priority to studies and wanted me to study hard and land up in a big corporate job so i never really got a chance to pursue my interest in dancing but after we started the studio , it really took us one whole year just to setup our operations , understanding the dance and dancing as a business while managing our finances and other things.

during this one year , i actually ended up dropping out of college and didn't tell anyone at the time cause even i was not sure what degree to pursue in its place plus i was also not feeling comfortable sharing this anyone since i was embarrassed they might make fun of me ...

so instead i decided to pursue dancing as a career , now its been 2 years since then .... things were going kinda good except one of my professor ended up calling my parents to report them that i had dropped out and then i had listen to the taunts and stuff even while managing the studio operations while learning how to dance ....

i did make a goal list though and i was able to achieve small goals at the start and i even had planned to complete my graduation with a different degree as 2024 starts...

But as of now lately ever since 2024 started , i dont feel motivated enough to do anything , not even studies , not even dancing and not even doing art and graffiti ( my part time comfort hobby ) I have lost all interest and even my financial condition is also not good .... i tried taking a break and then returning back to work but nothing is working ... i keep forgetting the class timings , dont really practice or rehearse like i used to and worst of all i have lost my creativity .... there is so much going around i dont really know how to sort things ...

sorry for my English its not that good but thanks for reading till here"
437,Why shouldn't I do it?,"Why shouldn't I do it?  I only have negative thoughts, when they tell me that ""you never know how life will evolve"" I only think that it could get worse.  I don't know why but until three years ago I wasn't like that, I loved my solitude and some friends even told me I was narcissistic (obviously I'm not saying it's a positive thing), in fact I didn't feel that way but in any case I wasn't Like this.  Now there is only darkness, I don't see the good in anyone and I don't trust anyone, above all I don't trust myself.  I don't even trust myself to publish this post here and any responses, I don't want to go to therapy because I'm afraid that the therapist might manipulate me.  I have become a black hole of negativity and I don't know why, nothing special has happened in these years, everything went on as usual and I don't know how to get out of it, maybe I don't even want to.  I read that if you become more positive the brain takes on a different structural shape because you have broader views... is this true?  I'm wasting my adolescence on myself and I feel too tired, withdrawn and completely disconnected from anyone.  Is it sensible to think that I can save myself?"
438,What else can I do?,"Depressed for a few years. 
I am medicated and I went to psychologist, mindfulness classes, studied nlp (helps me cope really!), I always try to improve myself, I do stuff even when I do t want to even hobbies and such, to keep busy so I don't drown in my own self.

On the paper looks like I was and still am doing a tremendous job and lots of people abd even psychiatrists mentioned it. I probably tried (not for a day, for a long while, really gave a chance to everything I could get my hands on). Journaling, gratitude, you name it.

I don't know what else to do, I don't have interest in life and what it has to offer, I have to work really hard to be excited from something.

I want to give up ;("
439,i almost killed myself last year but chickened out. it feels like i've been in a sort of purgatory since.,"i don't mean this in a religious sense, as i'm not religious. i think maybe that i mean i'm being punished in a way for not following through, though i'm not sure whom i'm being punished by or if my life is that much worse in a real, observable way. hell, i've traveled for several months now, but that feels more escapist to me than anything. i still feel like i'm just coasting through life.

the stats say i'll try again, so at least i can rely on that..."
440,"Another day, but everything seems to be repeating itself
","After a few days when mom was better and everything was fine, today she crocheted quite a lot and she was really calm, she didn't have bouts of crying anymore, it was as if her depression had disappeared and she was smiling, this evening her whole state of well-being changed. She came to my room crying while I was watching TV saying she needed a hug, I hugged her and waited for her to go back to her room but she refused to leave and lay on the bed next to me me and hugged me again, trying to kiss me and telling me what I should do to her to make her feel better. It's so hard to see her in such a degrading situation, I'm trying to understand what makes her behave so inappropriately with me and she ask me to do such things with her, but I can't understand it.

441,i’m slowly loosing myself,ever since i was young i’ve always had a strict mother but she’s a narcissist at the same time she didn’t care very much about my grades only letting me know when my grades were getting pretty bad but once i hit highschool it started to worsen a lot i’m currently a sophomore but my freshman year is when my mother started to show signs of mental abuse twords me starting by constantly scolding me and grounding me for having Cs in classes i never could understand why she would do this because she never really cared if i had Cs only low Ds or lower it then started to progress into her taking my belongings that she knew gave me joy like my xbox for example or even my phone and it wasn’t like i was being a bad kid i had good grades and i was never in trouble really in or outside of school i mostly kept to myself and my small group of friends it then escalated twords her taking my belongings without a reason and when i would ask her why she would simply say because i can and her mood would improve as she took them eventually she does give them back but then always talks to me with a attitude almost gaslighting me into starting a argument with her to simply take my stuff some time goes on and it continues as same school eventually ended because it was summer and she dialed down a lot basically letting me do or go wherever i wanted with my friends i finally felt happy for once thinking that maybe she was going through something i had not known but then school started up again and she immediately went back to doing what she was doing beforehand i still didn’t understand as too why right after the last day of school i came home and she was very angry because i had turned in a assignment with half credit keep in mind this literally the first day of school grades haven’t even been posted yet it usually takes a week but the assignment was a parent form that she made a mistake on she immediately took all my things my phone my xbox etc blaming me for her own mistake i told her that i had no control over the assignment and that the paper was for only her to sign she immediately called me a liar and left me with nothing for 2 weeks this is when it started to get bad she continued on taking my things repeatedly for no reason only her saying “because i can” i couldn’t go 1 day without her busting into my room and taking my belongings keep in mind i have nothing else that brings me joy other than my small friend group my phone and my xbox and she knows that the only things she would prevent me from having were those 3 things what makes it worse is that she feels like she knows everything about my schools education system even the grading system which they had changed over the summer for unknown reasons the teachers didn’t even understand the new grading system but sometimes my teachers would email my mother telling them that i needed some help in certain subjects but she would instantly assume that i was being lazy and wasn’t doing work i know now that she also used that for a reason to take my belongings she also takes everything out of proportion and changes what things actually mean into what she wants it to mean as of now she continues to do it i no longer feel comfortable inside my own home or even my life i have contemplated suicide multiple times not because of her taking my belongings but because of the mental abuse and verbal abuse she continues to throw ontop of me basically doing everything in her power to make me miserable without it being illegal if she had the chance to physically abuse me i’m sure of it she would pleas help.
442,Is it depression or my reality?,"I’m conflicted. I have these days where I feel so useless, pointless; effortless. I’m locked in my thoughts consistently and I can’t open up to anyone without the fear of burdening and imposing negative energy into them.

Even to a mental health professional it feels so odd to speak to someone I’ve never met in my life about issues that they have no interest in whatsoever, despite specialising in that area.

I have been affected by two brain hemorrhages (‘08 & ‘16) which has caused long lasting effects to my memory. It’s almost as if I was two different people from before and after and everyone tries to make me become the person I once was, completely discrediting the person that I am today. It’s been difficult coping with myself and who I am and it makes everything even more harder when I’m being compared to my old self.

I was recently fired from my job last month in January which has now locked me indoors for majority of my time. My last relationship ended in 2022 and that left me distraught, affected and I know a lot of emphasis and laughter relate around “trauma” but this genuinely had me distressed and in a mental chokehold. I self harmed during the end of that year and never told anyone. Locked and buried that inside of me. I had been involved with another person during the first to second quarter of last year but that ended immediately and never even passed the three month mark.

I’m lost in myself. I don’t have a purpose or reason for being whatsoever. I don’t know which direction to steer. I’m at a constant standstill. There are moments where I push through and do well but other days I’m stuck.

Those around me always tell me to change my way of thinking and while I agree it’s beneficial long term, it’s much more easier said than done. It’s become me and this is who I am. I’m constantly defeated by my actions and the things that I do I don’t understand."
443,I am confused,"I am so confused on whether or not all of this is my fault.

For Context 

I am a 16 MTF and My Ex partner is a 16 M

This all stems a while back to issues we had in our old relationship with a lot of arguing and me sometimes saying I didn't forgive them I was all around a terrible person but when I look back at it now I don't know who that person was, I know it was me but I also don't know why those things happened I feel abusive and I know in part I was but I felt so hurt by my partner that everytime I would mention some boundaries or things that needed to be changed they would be crossed. I would get so angry and he would handwrite apologies and such but things would never change and I didn't forgive him and i feel so stupid now because that's not the way I am anymore. 

However a lot more things happened and they continue to blame me for almost all of it if anyone is interested you can DM me and I'll tell you more but I just I feel like for some reason this is really all my fault and now he's going to leave me again and I'm so scared od him getting with someone else due to all the insecurities I have

TL;DR
My Ex partner and I started talking again 2 months ago after being broken up for 4 to 5 months without talking much they came back a while ago and we had a falling out yesterday now I'm getting left again because he doesn't think I've changed

444,How do I convince myself to stay in school?,"i’m not even gonna bother making it fancy, it’s probably gonna get ignored like just about every post i make…. sitting here, i’m covered up to my chest in absences. i am aware that too many can get me kicked out/expelled, but at the same time it 50/50 bothers me. aware of the consequences, i probably do care deep down, but being homeless/failure doesn’t scare me. do people really take this rat race seriously? i can’t convince myself to care, because when i do it all falls apart. i asked for help and it fell apart, probably part of why i’m here now.

imagine having no adult skills because you’re raised by a crack fueled middle-aged teenager, and the staff at school swoop in to save the day or whatever. no drivers license, job, etc. then they bail last minute when you have everything needed. i guess they didn’t see an extra paycheck for them in me…. i don’t even know if i have any self awareness, i just want whatever’s inside me to end. sorry for the sloppiness and formatting, everytime i get courage to ask for help it goes 10 million ways, and then i end up not knowing what to say. 

go as easy or hard if you want, i’m not trying to incite anything, a push in the right direction is a push."
445,I am really depressed ,"It's been almost 2 years that i have been depressed. At this point i am having sucidal thoughts  daily . Mainly in the morning and at night i get this really strong urge to just die i am in really deep emotional pain. I tried talking to my family but as of lately they have started to ignore me if i even give a hint of talking about how i am feeling. A small insult from friends can trigger me causes me to get very angry and depressed later on. I get this deep feeling of shame and guilt randomly even when the Day is going smoothly and nothing is wrong. I even think people around me have started to hate me because of things i have said and done when i am depressed,angry and irritated. I feel this deep sense of uneasyness around my chest when i am depressed i have tried talking to my family but they can't do anything because we live separately due to some personal reason . Day by day i am wishing this pain would end but it's been really long time and i don't think it will go on it's own. My class and grade is a mess .  I almost don't leave my house except when i am in class because I don't have energy to do anything else . I am miserable inside the only time i feel ok is when i am asleep. I don't know wtf should i do ??? I have tried to tie a rope and hang myself but i changed my mind half way through . The guilt, shame and this deep emotional pain is killing me daily and making me distant from people i love"
446,"I'm just so done, I don't know what to do","I'm at my breaking point. I have nothing to look forward to. Within literally 1,000 miles (as the crow flies) nobody cares about me. I have nothing to do, nowhere to go. I can't leave, I haven't been able to find a job elsewhere. I don't even know how I'll go about moving when I get one. The winter is beyond brutal, days are incredibly short, the cold is relentless and never ends, and there's literally nothing to do. Snowboarding, one of my only passions, is non existent here. I tried to salvage the season by spending a month in Alaska, but because I'm so out of shape I threw out my back and couldn't fully enjoy it. There was also the weather that didn't yield many days with great conditions. 

  
I've put on 25 pounds since mid December because all I do is drink beer and eat junk food, there's nothing else here. I'm so unmotivated, so depressed. I find it so hard to do the most basic things and take care of myself in any way. My winter coat constricts me like a fucking python because I've put on so much weight, I find it hard to even walk the dog these days. I hate my life. I want out. There's no decent mental health professionals in this god forsaken redneck shithole, they just make things worse. 

  
This is what it's like to be taken to the Yukon and abandoned after less than a year by an evil cunt who destroyed our marriage just for the hell of it, and then strung me along for a year because she was too much of a coward to just admit that she never valued it in the slightest and never gave a shit about me. We came here because her best friend is here, she has family here, I have fucking nobody, fucking nothing. I have no interest in meeting people here, dumb rednecks with dumber interests. All they do is fucking play video games, anyhting semi interesting outdoors in the winter requires thousands of dollars of gears and isn't even that interesting. I really don't know what to do, every day gets harder. I know that drinking will make me feel like shit tomorrow, but it's the only thing that gives me any relief today. "
447,How to ease the pain?,"Sometimes it’s unbearable and I have a very strong to do something radical. To selfharm, overdose or just do semthing with a possibility to kill myself. How can I maje the pain go away, at least a little. All I can think of are horrible things that happened or are happening to me. I can not see any light. When Im in this situation, I really want to feel something good, and the fact I want it hurts me even more and makes it not happen. I know selfharming is bad, but ehat else am I supposed to do, when the pain is unbearable?"

449,Depression back with a bang,"I 23F am going through a bad episode of depression, grief, and anxiety. It started a couple weeks ago and has been lingering. I have bipolar type 2 and am unmedicated (Can't afford it) so the lows are very low. I've been going through swings of crying randomly, being on edge, apathy, regret, paranoia (everyone hates me, my partner is going to leave me, my job thinks I'm incompetent, etc.) guilt, anger at the smallest things, stressed, then repeat. Grief comes and goes. But this bout is severe. I was a 24/7 caretaker for my grandmother who raised me. She was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer then moved to palliative care. It was a horrible experience. She refused all treatment and pain medication. Hospice barely helped and at times forgetting to even come out at all. My family fighting. My mother and aunt unable to take it emotionally so I ended up doing it. I was outta work, lost my entire friend group, and struggled for the first time with drinking. But I loved her and was there for her/comforted her till the end. However the lasting effects of being a caretaker still linger and I feel like everyday I'm pretending. Pretending I'm okay. Pretending like what I went through didn't change me. Didn't destroy a part of me. After her death, I spiraled. It was like losing my mother. I made horrible decisions that still haunt me now. I became a person who I didn't recognize. I got on my feet, went to grief counseling while I could afford it and was able to get to where I am now. I have a decent part time job and a partner who loves me. And I have been slowly meeting my goals. But right now, all I can do is cycle and think of the negatives. The world feels like all the color has be taken out of it and I'm riding passenger. Any advice would be greatly appreciated "

451,the other woman ,"
I don’t know how is an other woman like but lately I’ve been thinking if I am one of them. I feel like people use me and throw me away, like they use me as a band-aid, they say that I’m making them feel good but then they leave when they got their benefits. They say I’m beautiful and they want me but then they use me and leave me, and I end up being alone with all these thoughts. I don’t know if I ever was someone’s actual love, I don’t know if someone actually cried for me, if someone actually get drunk and feel bad because of losing me, if someone was obsessed with me and loved me like I loved them, if someone actually cared about me and tried to protect me, if I was really the main woman on their lives and not someone they use for their body or beauty, if I was really the main woman and not the other woman, I don’t know. "
452,I can’t get out of bed today.,"I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I eat healthy and exercise to prevent depression, but it keeps creeping back up on me. I’ve always struggled with anxiety and depression. Things/situations in my life never felt right. I never felt right… and I don’t why I am this person or why this is my life. 

I’m so plagued with defeat/depression that I just can’t do today. 

Please keep in mind that I am not a lazy person. I do everything in my power to make my life better… To feel better. 

But everything I do to make it better gets shot down over and over again. It’s almost like this is supposed to be my life. I’m supposed to not have anything meant/good for me. 

I’m not suicidal, but I pray most of the time for God to just take my life already. I feel so guilty when I see people die who had a great life. And I just think why them? It should have been me. 
"
453,Identity crisis and deteriorating personality,"Title. It feels like my identity, personality, values, principles, everything is being removed and replaced by something else, strange and foreign. Where depression ends and I begin? When and how did I cross this line? Was there even such a line?

This really fucks with my head and perception of reality. Even though I say my personality is being replaced, my wreck of a brain instantly corrects me:

""Replaced by what, exactly? What was there before?""


And I can't fucking remember...

It all began years ago,  with me sometimes questioning myself, at the heights of depressive episodes. I would stop whatever I'm doing, and literally ask myself out loud: ""What am I doing here? What for? Why shoudn't I just walk out the window right now?"" I'm stuck in a loop of these questions, now they never go away.

I keep trying to remember who and how I was, before depression, when I was a teen. I just can't remember. How did I overcome my past traumas, big and small, how did I react both mentally and physically? How the fuck did I endure abusive parents and their divorce, poverty, deaths of closest friends, betrayals and a broken heart, busted nerves and bones, doesn't matter. Where the fuck is that mental strength, where did it go? Why I fall apart and disintegrate into pieces now over the smallest of inconviniences, when in past I could take soul-crushing crippling events and not kill myself?

Everything is covered in mist, I can't clear this fog out. Depersonalization, derealization, I guess. Perhaps it's some kind of a defense mechanism, just brain trying to distance my present self from past self?
Or I guess I'm finally going nuts after seventeen years of enduring depression.

Apologies for the wall of text. I really needed to vent.

Thank you for reading, and stay strong everyone. Don't lose yourself...no matter how much of a mess you think you are."

455,How to feel like anything good is in my future?,"Long story short, my life has been filled with trauma since I could remember. I was raped at 18 by a man I met on the internet, killed myself over grades in college, have a really crippling chronic case of PCOS (non insulin related), have been sexually assaulted numerous times, and my dad died in 2021, the only man who ever loved me. I work an insane amount and that feels like all I do to try and support myself. I'm about to turn 27, and I have seen so many ""men"" (Creeps) from dating apps, and I'm still single. People will tell me I'm a beautiful woman, so why I'm still single, I don't understand. Every guy I meet seems to be a creep who just wants to fuck and leave. I'm so sick of this, I'm a good woman, and I've tried to meet guys so many ways, but now everyone is taken or is like, a manipulator no other woman wanted. I really don't know how to feel like my life will ever be more than this. I'm sick of feeling like I work so hard for nothing, like all I've ever been is a sex doll to men. I can't take crying every night, dreaming of a day I'd have someone who'd love and respect me, and I wanted a baby before I died. I am feeling so hopeless, and therapy doesn't help. Dating apps are filled with creeps, and I really have no idea what to do. They've put me in so many dangerous situations, bars suck, I don't have any girlfriends to help me meet guys. It's just a crazy life to live this way and try to keep it together. Thanks for listening to me if you did"

457,depression has made me sleep so much ,"i dont have a sleeping schedule. i usually sleep the next day on the afternoon like 12 pm 1pm ish then i would wake up the next day at 12 am 2 am sometimes i would wake up only for an hour to play games then i would sleep again, then again wake up the next day. its a cycle.  i have eating problems so i only eat when i want to which is not healthy since ive been to a hospital because i dont eat much. i can go on days without eating even if the doctors already told me that i should stop doing this. the thing is i sleep so much. like so fucking much. i dont do anything. i just rot in bed. im not in school either. i do take antidepressants. i dont know man all i do is sleep. its making me more depressed. nothing is entertaining anymore. im so tired."
458,Depression isn’t letting me feel love,"I’ve been dating my partner for over 2 years. The first months were amazing, we were a perfect match, we felt in love, we had so much in common and did everything together with all the happiness in the world (as much as my mild depression let me, of course). Now my condition has gotten worse, and I can’t enjoy the relationship anymore. I still believe she’s the perfect person, caring, sweet, supporting, she has tried to understand me and never made fun of me nor invalidated me. She even cried sometimes because of how bad she felt for me

I know she’s the perfect person, but I can’t tolerate being in a relationship with her. Why? Because she’s my main obsessive comparison and my depression (and ocd) continuously tells me that I am inferior to her in all ways and I can’t help but feel tremendously bad and upset about it. It has even created a grudge against her, even if she never did anything malicious to me. But in my subconscious, she has. So now I am irritable, impatient, insensitive, and I talk dryly because I can’t tolerate any sign of love happening. I can’t tolerate her loving a piece of trash like me. I constantly tell her to go find someone better and to leave me alone, to forget about me, forget my existence, even if I know that’s the last thing I would want and it’d destroy me. But I don’t know how else to cope

A bit of context, we are the same age, she started university a year after me due to her school having an additional year, and yet I failed most my exams and eventually my career till I had to drop out last November, to start a new one where I’m already doing bad. She, instead, has made it to 4th year with only one failed exam and many high marks. 

She also looks so much better physically, she has such unique looks like gorgeous green eyes while I have plain brown (she got compliments on them and I have never been complimented for my looks). Similarly happens with other body parts that I have ugly and she looks like a model (we’re both girls so the comparisons are worse)

She is stronger, has more will and resilience. I am a quitter and sleep like a bear while she could go for a week sleeping only 2 hours 

She has skills and talents, she’s awesome at piano and drawing, I’ve drawn my whole life, went to academies, but I’m not good at it. I’ve also tried instruments and I sucked. I sucked at everything I’ve tried (music, sports, martial arts, science, etc) this and a lot more.

All of this has lead me to not be sure if I love her anymore. I feel like I do as I want to cuddle her and I love seeing anything related to her, but this frustration sometimes makes me be insensitive and I hurt her, or can’t care if she’s crying anymore. I also feel like I’m treating her badly because she’s making me feel this bad even without meaning it. I don’t want to lose her but I don’t want to continue hurting her and become a monster either, but she sobs every time I tell her we should part ways and tells me she can’t let go of me.

Is this normal to feel thanks to these conditions? Am I a monster? What is going on? Is it possible love is still there?"

463,How can I be happier? ,"I've always wondered how I can feel happier, I usually feel sad and depressed and at times end up with suicidal thoughts and I just really want to be happier "
464,I am stuck with a hot tempered and irritable bf who can't work and earn money and I want to cry,"Me (29f) and he (28m). We've been together for 5 years now. We met online and were LDT, then he moved to my country after 6 month of relationship (I know it was too soon). Back in his country he was working in a factory for 5 years. And I didn't know the job will be a problem.

He can't find and keep a job. He can't earn money. He feels ok leaching over me. He has mental problems which make him kinda inept towards working. He shouts at me often and he says it's bcs I've done or said something stupid. He has social anxiety and doesn't talk irl with anyone except me. He gets mad over minor things like electricity blackout for a minute or internet losing connection. He stomps and throws things. And we don't have money so he could get a therapy over his anger and mental blocks (and he only agrees to medical therapy).

We have good moments but it's like 40% good 60% bad.

I wanted to break up with him after a year of relationship. But till this day I can't. Bcs he moved to my country and I feel like I'm responsible for him. If I break up with him he's gonna be homeless and suicide. I can't live with such a guilt through the rest of my life so I'm still with him. We don't have enough money to live apart (cause he doesn't have money). I've only accepted my fate that I have to find him a good job somehow and he could provide himself so I could leave. But that's a very hard task and I have my own problems.

That's not how I imagined my 23 to 29 year's old. I feel pity abt myself. Why I couldn't pick some who could at least work at provide himself and didn't have so many mental problems. I aged a lot. I'm broke. I wish I better didn't have relationship at all then with him. Or I could find someone awesome and have happy 23-29 years old. But no.

It's rant and cry for help at the same time. It's self hatred for picking him and bringing him here. But I won't listen your advice, I will sleep and tomorrow pretend like everything is fine and I'm fine being shouted and broke."

466,I dreamed about taking suicide ,"For years i have been struggling with depression. I was 10 when it started. I tried get help but no one took me seriously. So i stop and try live normal. Everything went alright i guess. I lost my closest friend and was pretty much alone.

Im now 19. I have gone to therapy but i felt it didn't work. I take depression pills, but they dont work much. I keep having thoughts that i want to die.

Lately i have dreamed about overdose, jump off a building, cut to i bleed and all kind off death things. I dint know what to do with life anymore..."
467,Listener,"Im currently 15. For as long as I've live, I've never actually tell someone how I actually feel. Its always me who listen to them rather than them listening to me. I also want to know how it feels to be listened. For  once, I actually want to feel listened to. To those who say I never made the decision to open up to someone, I've done it. Multiple times actually. All they ever done is ignore it, lecture me, or talk around it. Even my own parent won't listen to me talking about my health. It may not seem but to live in this kind of situation are hard. My family has split up, I've developed depression at such a young age. If I were to open up to my family, all they said is ""you shouldn't say such things because you are still young. You know nothing about life. Kids should be having fun. You don't need to think about it much, all you need to do is learn to have fun"", yet I've never had any fun. I don't want to seem selfish so I made the assumption that if I were to listen to them, maybe they would listen to me. But they never did. All they did is talk about how hard their life are, how hard it is to have a difficult situation to live in. Then what about my feeling? Does it not matter to anyone? All they did is gaslight me into thinking that I have never thought of anyone else's feelings. I want to actually know how does it feel to cry a hug by someone you love. To cry my heart out. To let out all my pain that I hide. But to hope something that big to happen is impossible. It's just a dream... "

469,I hate myself. ,"I hate every part of me. I hate my face. I hate my body. I hate who I am. I hate my personality. I hate how I look, how I talk, how I walk, how I am. 

I’m such a difficult person to be around with. I ruin everything I touch. I’m not a person. I am just a sack of meat filled with overwhelming emotions. I’m so toxic. I’m just filled with rage, sadness and bitterness. I’m so useless. I’m worthless.

If who I really was showed on the external, no one would dare look my way. If my insides showed on the outside, I would have bloody eyes, raw skin that’s been clawed at, a rotting brain and decaying organs, I’d have a heart that’s swollen and ready to explode and my lungs would be purple from all the anxiety. 

If I slept with guys looking like my internal self, they would shoot themsleves. If my ex’s see the real damage inside, they would count their blessings. 

Everyone tells me I’m beautiful but they would kill themsleves from the darkness if it’s reflected externally on me. I can’t believe what anyone ever says. I feel like a corpse that’s always embalming myself when I get dressed and post.

I am not human. I never was. I came out of my mom rotting. I’ve been walking this world soulless. A cockroach can’t be compared to the filth that I am. 

I can’t connect. I can’t love. I can’t learn. I can’t regulate. I can’t be calm. I am a forest fire. I will burn and burn myself and everything around me till there’s nothing left. 

I am the problem and always have been. No amount of cleansing can cleanse the darkness that resides within me. Nothing can drain out the poison in me. 

I am not a sweet girl.

I’m a monster that’ll take your soul because I have none. 

This is who I am. "
470,losing my will to live,"This isn't meant to be a political post. It's just part of it. I don't have the energy to fight. I just want to sleep forever. I watch as my friend loses family member after family member in Gaza, where she's from, and I see her breaking and literally suicidal. I don't know how to help her, and having already lost a loved one to suicide, I am praying and screaming to the forces that be that she stays with us. I have never seen someone's soul crack open so thoroughly. I see my country actively ignoring calls for peace and even funding this, and when you see the pictures of little Abdullah \[not real names used\] who would have been 13 or Jamal who just got a bike, it's so impossibly real just how bad things are - when you see their pictures, know their stories, see videos of family gatherings, it's... it's so different than just the stuff on the news. I see trans and nonbinary folks being literally beaten to death in bathrooms and I am afraid as a gender nonconforming person with a tenuous relationship with my gender identity (and a uterus, given how things are going). If I don't dress or look the way I'm supposed to, or if I don't do the prescribed things my sex is ""supposed"" to do, will this spread? Am I safe? I'm also saving as much as I can, but I am living in poverty in America and I am afraid every day I am going to be homeless. I feel hopeless, despite getting a degree from the ""right"" school and pursuing grad school. Money is tight. Food is tight. Healthcare is a terrifying thing. It keeps me up at night, not knowing if I will be housed or fed or clothed. Or if my test results come back bad for an illness my doc suspects I have, will the medication costs bleed me dry? My entire paternal side of the family has disowned me for refusing to go to my father's funeral - a man who beat me and hated me till his dying day and was an active member of the literal Ku Klux Klan. No shit, I didn't go to support that dude's memory. But now I've lost people I thought actually loved me - because I dared to say ""no, I will not venerate someone who lived and died with such hate in their heart"". 

I am not suicidal, I just don't know if I have the will to live. I feel like I care so deeply and the world is cruel and pushing in on me. I feel like I'm drowning. I want to feel joy again, I want to find that fire I had in me again, but I am tired. I see so much hate, and it feels like hate and violence and pain are winning out. I look to the future, where I used to have hope. Now I don't have that, I'm just afraid. I feel powerless, out of control, and I don't have anything keeping me going. Idk where to find the will to live again. "

478,VENLAFAXINE Experience ,"I started taking Venlafaxine and I feel so sick. I’ve been taking it for two months and I feel numb and my brain feels muddy. I spoke to my doctor and she basically said, “is bad enough that you actually need to change it”. I thought it was a really weird response. This is the 4th antidepressant that I’ve been on and I’m really over this process. Lexapro worked so well for me but I couldn’t control my bowels… I feel like I’m at the end of my rope. My doctor made feel confused I guess? I feel like I can’t keep asking for a new medication but I know I have to. Idk I guess I’m venting. When did a medication start working for you? How many did you try? Is there something like Lexapro I could take? I’m not looking for clinical advice. I’m just trying to hear other’s perspectives.

Lexapro

480,"Now I’m lost, broken.","Met a girl on Reddit two years ago, we started talking slowly at first but eventually we got to talking everyday. We talked about any and everything, texts all day, video calls, voice messages. Holidays if we were busy it didn’t matter, we always had time to text each other. For two straight years, not missing a day morning to night.

I caught feelings for her, she made it clear we weren’t and couldn’t be a couple I was still in love with her but I loved talked to her and she seemed to enjoy it too. So I accepted it because I wanted to talk to her needed to talk to her. 

One day last week she seemed out of the ordinary, I was worried something happened to her. She brushed my worries off until Friday morning when she said she was talking to another guy but never told me. Which was a shot in the heart to me. I thought I was the only one, like I couldn’t think of when, we talked for most if not all day. Then the bullet that broke my heart, she said he wasn’t comfortable with her talking to me.

Im now broken, she is a part of my life, still is. I can’t sleep, I can’t eat, nothing interests me anymore, I don’t want to do hobbies. All I want to do is talk to her. Ask about her day say hi, anything. I just need that constant conversation, after two straight years to go cold turkey as brought me to the hospital seeking help.

481,Key to happiness,"Hey guys,  
so, long story short:  
My dad killed himself 3 years ago, his father tried as well. I was 19 years old and watching after my younger sister. Had a hard time, but successfully got over it, even before that, I can't remember being happy from the age of 12. Below I show you my Key to happiness. Be balanced and read a lot!  
Key to happines  
  
\-	Analyze why your not happy  
\-	Analyze what makes you happy, or maybe could  
\-	Figure out how to change what makes you sad  
\-	Read books for knowledge and vocabulary  
\-	Work on it  
\-	Try to do what makes you happy and try a lot of different things  
  
While doing so, stay fit, eat healthy, brush your teeth, take cold showers, learn how to breathe correctly, learn about basic finance, work on yourself, and clarify your ideas for the future. Don’t give up to early and don’t  keep doing something you don’t like, except it gets you somewhere you want to get. Always follow your own Mesotes. Be positive and enjoy the process. If you forgive yourself right now and start doing all this, you will be happy. Keep in mind, what happened has already happened, you can’t change it. Look forward and enjoy the present. All you can possibly do now, is be the best version of yourself in the situation you are right now.   
  
Be disciplined, be hard to yourself and easy with others. Most of them don't have it easier than you have.  
Serenity to accept the things you cant change and courage to change those you can.

482,Smelly flatulence (due to constipation first) by depression?,"30y, Bad.

For the past few years, thinking and being with people has been tiring for me, I'm gradually losing everything, even my health, so the reason for this post is to ask you if anyone among me has had the problem of foul-smelling flatulence (probably due to constipation) as soon as your stress level and bad thoughts go up a lot during the day. 

**If yes**, how did you solve this darn problem? Is depression to blame for this problem, do you find? 

I can no longer walk around and sit in public places that my clothes despite having washed them still emit the strong odors of flatulence that I emit because of this intestinal problem of mine (secondary to stress and depression?).

The Dr gave her the on call nuse’s number and said call 911 if something like that happened again.

Here’s the problem: her pharmacy never got the new prescription. She’s tried calling (and leaving a message) with the nurse twice and her Dr once. It’s been over a week.

I wouldnt be able to do it (i think) since the picture of pain or suffering goes over my thoughts but im scared that im thinking about it so seriously.

&#x200B;

As a context, i grew in a house with a family that looks amazing but my father gets easily unstable and sometimes he gets really angry and puts all that anger on me, its been years since its physical but now its worst since most of the days he gets home to complain about me and the failure i am in a lot of aspects, he has said really bad stuff that im not comfortable sharing. besides that im in college and also work with my family, i cant focus on college since my father always points how ""im dedicated to my teachers but not him that is the one that pays them"" but i do my job and just make a few mistakes. I cant study since all the time im thinking about him getting home and hurt my feelings and make me feel bad. 

Also, i´ve never been a relationship guy since i grew seeing my fathers fighting. but about a year ago i met a girl in my friend group that i liked, we talked for a year and a half almost everyday and she fought with all our friends because she didnt work, however i stood with her and try to make her see that she was wrong but i was not leaving her. Multiple times i told her that if we were not gonna be in a relationship i didnt mind being friends but let me step away a little to solve my feelings, but she always came back and flirted.

By november we started dating but she left me 2 weeks ago and i found out she was dating a common friend since we started dating too, she said she never had feelings for me and just tried to and what was 1 year and a half of moments that i wanted to keep pretty on my mind turn into a lie. I didnt forgive her and i see her all weeks but we dont talk at all and she seems pretty fine with it. Hurted that the only person i ever loved just never cared about me.

I just got out of college exams on computer science with my heart broken and did poorly and now i dont feel motivated, i just dont want to study, work or even play, not even eating feels like a need which is new to me. Its my birthday in 2 weeks and i know im gonna be sad about it

I dont know what to do anymore, and i know other people deal with worst stuff and i feel bad for feeling this but i cant anymore.

493,Depressed Heartbroken Obsessing over girl I never dated,"I haven't really posted before on reddit so I'm not sure if there is a correct way to post this.   


I 29M have had a lot of mental issues like anxiety, low self esteem for a long time. I had other issues as well but I had just distracted myself and never really addressed them properly. For example, I've had a desire to be in a relationship for a long time, and get married as well due to religious reasons. It's just due to there always being an expectation that I would marry according to my parents' will, i.e have an arranged marriage, and there being less of a dating culture in Pakistan where I'm from, especially in my city, which is relatively small, the only opportunity I had of finding a relationship was online.  


Ok, so just realize, I had one proper relationship, at age 18, which was an online one, which lasted just 3 months, and I broke up with her because I was dumb and also emotional and self sabotage. I begged her to get back together with me and it took around 6 months and we did get back together but things weren't the same and we just broke up again. I am alone again. I did have a few crushes after that but honestly got my heart broken every time after that.   


Through High School and University then, I never really had a relationship, and was lonely, even though, I wanted to be in one. And there's a constant self resentment rising in me, because I was at best average at anything I did, even though my family supported me through everything and did their best to give me anything they wanted. This peaked, when my dad sold his car, just to be able to send me to Germany for my master's degree. But I was unable to get a job there, not even an odd job, due to the language barrier.  


In all of this situation, all my friends back home were already married and had families. And my online friends were also in loving relationships, and heading towards marriage, and some were already married. And my feeling of loneliness, kept increasing, and I would just keep myself distracted. In this time, my closest friends, who're a couple, bring a friend of theirs to our discord, and well, we'd recently started playing fortnite and she also played so when she came, she'd play with us and this is where the problem escalated. I just grew very fond of her, very quickly, because I think she just gave me just enough attention, more than I was used to from a girl and quickly grew feelings for her, even to the point of obsession, and behaved like an incel, like, trying to just stay in private call with her, as I was mainly felt threatened by some of the other guys there, of which one was a very close friend, but like very successful at things he did.  


Anyway, I accidentally let on that I liked her, and she said that she only wants to be friends. I, just for being with her, said I'll try just being friends as well but I couldn't. It came to a point where I was going through proper depression, unable to study, and it even came to self harm where I would cut myself, because I hated myself because I feel unlovable. I find myself unattractive, overweight, uninteresting with no interesting hobbies or skills, and the self harm got progressively worse.  


Now I've had to come back to Pakistan because I was thinking about suicide there in Germany living alone, and also, even tried to, but couldn't because of the pain. I've booked an appointment with a psychiatrist already and it's like 5 days away, but I'm feeling lonely and in pain. And she's in the same discord group as me, so a place that should've been a safe space for me, is not. Plus, she and a very old friend of mine have gotten close so it has strained my friendship with him as well, effectively it seems over. Because they know that them being there, drives me insane literally, and they still actively just sit in group together, even though they can sit on private call as well.  


I later found out that even when we did sit together on vc, or talked in DMs, she acted nice but would later make fun of me behind my back to the others in the group and say how my behavior was disgusting meanwhile she would act all nice infront of me.

494,i cant stop self harming,"i have done this since i was 10 years old and i remember the very first time i ever did it. i remember the instant relief and control and sense of calm that washed over me. i dont even think i understood what i was doing, but i immediately knew this would be the thing i would do for the rest of my life. now im 22. and i still do this thing that i was supposed to have grown out of years ago. and now when i do it, i cant understand a reason to stop. the only thing that ever stopped me before was punishment from my parents. but now im an adult and am supposedly in control of my life. my girlfriend might look at me strange. she might even break up with me over it. but secretly i hope she does because it will confirm that im too awful for her just as i'd believed. and then, even more secretly, i think about how i will be free to hurt myself as much as i like without needing to hide it or make excuses anymore. i can hurt myself until my skin is unrecognizable and maybe i will become a different person. that thought excites me, as sick as it is. i love my girlfriend but i cant stop this pattern of behavior for her. so ill keep lying and hurting myself in ways that i can excuse, until shes found me out and knows how awful i really am. 

i participate in almost every form of hurting there is. i cut myself, burn myself, hit myself until im black and blue and cant even stand up straight anymore. i hit myself so hard once i damaged a nerve and it still hurts months later. and as sick as it is, i love that fact. i dont know what to do because i know its something im not supposed to do. ive gotten in trouble and been scolded and offered other coping skills millions of times throughout my life. ive gone a year or two without it, because people tell me its bad and i shouldn't, but i always come back to it. i just cant see any reason not to. it hurts no one but me, and its the one coping mechanism that has worked all my life. the one thing that makes my body feel like its my own. so many times in my life my body has been stripped of its autonomy, the countless times where it seemed it belonged to everyone but me. this gives it all back to me, even for a moment. so why should i stop that at all? why is it so bad to everyone else but me?"

I have work colleagues that have been really good to me and I’m just being a dick, ignoring them and giving short answers for no reason. But I can’t do anything to stop it, I’m slowly losing the will to even speak. I work in a job that I need to be chatty and upbeat too. Now I’m sat outside my gym, scared to death to go in, my anxiety is through the roof, I’m terrified of being around people and loud music. But then tomorrow, whether my mind is right or not, I’ll get up and do the same or be really chatty.

I fucking hate this. It’s ruining potential relationships, friendships, work life. I can’t do anything about it. I’ve lost so many friends from my shit attitude when I’m down. When I’m good, life is great. But now, it’s just hopelessness, endlessly.

I don’t even want help. I do drugs, steroids and become a recluse, staring at the ceiling when I’m in a bad cycle. This is how life is now.

I haven’t had sex in months, I don’t even know how to go about even bothering to get it. Everything tears me apart. I’ve tried writing down all the good, nice things people have said or think of me but it’s just overwhelmed by my negative thinking.

497,Need advice,"Does anyone who suffer from depression have a slight issue with family?


For me, I have major depression and have episodes. My family doesn't believe in mental illness even though it's on my medical record. They always think I'm faking it or making up excuses, when it's hard for me to do stuff. To me they seem a little toxic and when I bring it up to them all of them gang up on me, just to blame me for whatever. When I'm suicidal or self harming. They always tell me I'm looking for attention or why are you so weak, your dumb af to do some stupid sh*t like that or joke saying will I see you alive when I get home.

Half the time I wanna leave my family and cut ties, cause due to my self harming and episodes they don't want me around and told me I'm not welcome back. But how can I leave when I don't have the money to move nor a don't have car. Getting a job is hard, I've tried. I just want to be away from them.

500,Tried to make friends. Ended up getting racially discriminated against instead.,"I grew up in the US, but my parents are Hispanic. So of course, I look Hispanic. My family and I took a trip to Mexico, and we were staying at a resort. One day, I saw some kids my age playing volleyball. These kids were white American, and there were other people playing that were Mexican locals. I started to play with them, and one of the boys started making little comments about people not performing well. It didn't take long to realize that he was talking about me. I wanted to say something, but I didn't want to get into a fight with a stranger.

At one point, the ball hit me in the face, and my glasses came flying off. A lady told me in Spanish where they landed, but I was embarrassed and not thinking clearly. I said loudly in English, ""what did you say?!"" After that, the same boy who was talking bad started being super nice to me after. I think he realized that I spoke English. He showed me how to throw the ball, and even though I still wasn't playing good, he kept telling me that I was improving. But that whole thing just put me in a bad mood, and I didn't want to hang out with those kids after."
501,I can't seek help because I'm ashamed,"When people say this I would think it was so stupid, how can being depressed make you feel ashamed or embarrassed? But now that I've finally accepted that I need to seek help, I've realised I'm way too scared.

I'm 17F and I think I've been depressed my whole life. Like I was born this way or something. I can't remember ever really feeling happy. I know that I've had happy moments, but they've been suppressed to the back of my mind where I can't recall them.

I was born sad, I think but I started experiencing suicidal ideation when I was 12. Currently, I know I'm too scared to actually directly attempt anything, but I do hope that something bad would happen to me. Like I get into a car accident or get murdered in the street or something, which is bad, I know.  When I was 14, I did the classic paracetamol attempt and it obviously didn't work and I genuinely feel like I just did it for attention (although I really did/do want to die but I'm way too scared). Anyway, my parents weren't concerned - they were angry. Actually, my mum was angry, my dad didn't say anything about it.

My parents know there is something wrong with me I think. It's hard to know what they think because they are immigrants and I never picked up their language, plus their relationship with me is horrible, and even worse with each other. I don't want to say the word ""abusive"" even though I'm sure it applies because I hate labelling things. I haven't even admitted to myself that I am depressed up until now.

The only reason I'm starting to admit to myself I have this problem is because it's really starting to affect my life. Before, I could just get on with things and be relatively normal. But now, it's affecting my schoolwork. And it's very important because I'm applying to universities this year and if I fuck up I'm finished. Literally finished. As in, I have no other options and my life is over. And I'm currently fucking up.

So I want to go to my GP to get them to medicate me. I was super against for a long time but I think it's the only thing that will work.  I've done CBT before and I find it useless. But I can't tell my parents. I don't know why, because I don't feel outright shame, it just feels like they don't deserve to know my business. I know they're my parents and they should help me but they can't. I have gone months and months without talking to my dad, living under the same roof. I really can't talk to my parents about anything, even good things, without there being some sort of argument.

I don't know why I'm even posting this here. I don't have any friends that are close enough to me where I can talk about this. I just want something to fix this so I can get on with my life.

I have all the time and all the ingredients to cook something, but I can't. I don't know what to cook, so it will be enough to fill my stomach, and if I somehow manage to cook some food, I will totally lose my appetite and eat like 1 spoon of it, then trash the rest. Such a food waste >.>I will just rather lay in bed and pitty myself how ""lazy"" I am to cook and starve rather than get up... The only way I eat something is when my boyfriend cooks for me, or I order it (but that's expensive).

505,Rant,"I don't really know where to start. I have been depressed for 12 years, I feel there are a few things that contribute to it. I used to live in a hostile environment with hostile parents. Not being able to find a job as I keep getting either rejected or just ghosted. I often get these sudden lonely episodes even when I like my company alone and look through what activities my previous friends are doing and it's usually just them hanging out together and having a good time. But when I ask them to hang out or catch up I'm usually left with no replies or just the usual busy excuse. Most of my time I pretty much spend it on my bed just laying there thinking about how useless I am and how I shouldn't exist. I have attempted to take my own life multiple times and I just don't bother now, because no matter what I do I just won't die. I would be in therapy right now if I wasn't on the bloody waiting list and even when I was younger my case was dismissed. I just don't want to live anymore and I've tried to better myself with activities I used to like or just trying to do things that would have made me happy, but I lack the motivation to do so and I just feel nothing about things that would have brought me joy.

I'm highly inconvenienced by very minor things that happen in my day to day life nowadays. Like my friends laughing at me because I accidentally did something silly, to one of my relative's remarks about me. 

But I still suck them all up, and just keep them to myself, burying them deep down, until I stop thinking about them. 

And with every angry thought that erupts in my mind after each conflict/ minor inconvenience I bury, I feel like I am becoming more and more selfish and heartless. Thinking about just myself.

511,Hi.,"I've been wanting to make a post for so long but never did cause either I don't think people will care so why, I don't know how to write it, end of the day I never write about it for the same reasons I'm depressed. Lack of action. But you know what fuck it.

Backstory: I've been depressed all of my life, sounds like a stretch but let me explain, my family is broken and at the time of birth we were struggling financially and in Nigeria so extra stress, I went through my youth wishing for sleep and death, also religiously I grew up chaotic (a bit of backstory as well here my dad was traditionalist:idol worshipping and stuff then turned Catholic then muslim I guess there's more to unpack here than I ever thought about but not to get off topic), in our household we weren't really religious but my mom still forced the mentality on us so we'd basically bounce from church to mosque to a shrine or whatever, so that fucked me up or liberated me depends on how you think about it. 

Anyway family is kinda fucked and I was plugged into it, I imbibed everything I heard from my mom and still do which as a child fucked me up because she hated my dad, he has his issues, she was the breadwinner of the family and always called him out about it and never hid it in fact she urged me to mentally manipulate him by going to ask for funds like school fees when we both knew he couldn't provide it and when I refused she'd get mad. Don't get me wrong she's still my mom but here's why I don't trust anyone and in extension anything. 

At the youngest age, I believed in nothing, my parents lied, so I did too, religion was only for show to me cause how would I worship different gods and not be punished, I had no role models cause everyone I knew was an extension of my mother and they were also failed people. So gods are fucked, humans are fucked, what isn't fucked.

This is long and you might be bored so I'd summarise (i didn't summarise I'm sorry), I was intelligent and good looking and also depressed or something along the lines (never actually been diagnosed cause I've never complained about depression until this day) I had ""friends"" but they weren't really, I didn't really care about them and didn't bother when they didn't care about me, I deep down have always wanted to die but haven't committed suicide for 2 reasons, one is I truly believe in a God and don't think suicide will be pleasing to him thanks Islam, 2nd is my mom, I actually pity her, she's always worked and provided for us, she got it rough and I just want to succeed cause of her.

Relationships are weird, I've had about 6 or 7 (if you count my experiment being bi) relationships but I never asked them out, they were the ones who asked me and they're all good looking, they literally fell on my lap and i converted it. I have a decent personality, I find it easy to digest things at surface level and cross between topics, thanks to genetics and early years of struggle I'm athletic so the girls come to me easy but I don't actually want to live so I don't grow any of these relationships, i don't know any birthdays and often forget mine, I've broken up with all of them, long story short I'm passively killing myself but some things out of my control lead me to growth and success. 

I'm 27 this year, pretty good job, pretty fit, good looking, healthy, if I was in a crowd you wouldn't know I'm exhausted, suicidal(daily thoughts no action), my siblings are exhausted, my parents are exhausted, I don't actually see a point to life but if we're all gonna die I don't see a point killing myself it's weird. 

Only thing I want is a child and a family, but I'm terrified I'm not worthy of one cause how can someone like me have such a thing. Genuine pure connections.

I'm using this post to vent, idc if no one cares (lie), the world is still gonna spin, I'm not trying to be a victim so this doesn't appeal to me. I hope everyone struggling finds someone willing to struggle with them they can actually trust and love and I hope they're open to it and it goes perfectly. if anything in life every human being deserves a partner that gets them no matter how fucked up you are there are 8 billion people on this earth ffs all i want is 1 that gets me.

Fuck this is long, happy reading and I hope it made sense. Good luck and godspeed."
512,Correct dosage for sertraline?,"My mom has been having paranoid delusions for the last 2 weeks. She was given 25 mg sertraline for the anxiety by her primary care doctor. Convincing her to take anything at all has been war because in her mind she really is being chased by the FBI, and we are trying to drug her. Yes we have been to the psych wing of the ER. No they can’t hold her there because she doesn’t show signs of harming herself. I tried to get her to see a psych online but she is extremely paranoid of being recorded so only yesterday could  I get an appt in person. She was diagnosed with psychotic depression. This is what the doc prescribed:
100 mg sertraline
10 mg olanzapine 
.4 mg alprazolam

I’m worried that we are increasing dosage to quickly especially on sertraline ( been on 25 mg for 2 weeks) I agree antipsychotics are necessary and sertraline alone won’t do anything and I also understand her current dosage is too low to do anything. My question is what should I look out for? I’ve been told by a friend that increasing sertraline quickly can lead to suicide ideation?

Does anyone have experience with this illness?"

I don't know what I'm looking for here, either advice, kind words or just get this off my chest. I'm 23 years old male currently on uni. I was all my life that one depressed fat nerd in your class. This went with me from elementary, high-school up to uni. Corona year was my first year at uni, and it went really bad with me I got more depressed, fatter and I tryed to kill myself during that time. First semester after corona I didn't even wanted to stay in uni. Things were bad for me bud somehow I prevailed. Things were going up and down in some time I got better lost weight, got rid of most part of my depression. I thought that things can be better got some new friends, started going out etc. This went for little less that 2 years. For a past few weeks I started to more and more self-doubt myself again. I realised from listening to my so called friends that I missed a big portion of my life in depression and anxiety. All of them have something they are good at if it's a sport or hobby or something they can show to impress people around them. All of them did very interesting, funny or cool things. They spend more time together without me and I fallen out from inner circle. They are good at communicating with girls and can choose which one they can be with and which one they don't like. And there is me realising that after two years of recovering from past I have nothing to show no talent nothing to good at, can't loose weight even if I exercise a lot(bc I'm scared of ""voice"" in my head). Can't talk to girls bc I think that I don't have any value to show and I think about myself that I'm so ugly that won't be interested to talking with me. Lost all my time of poberty in depression, developing nothing. I'm just need to write this here, bc I have nobody to talk to about these things. I don't want to go bact to that dark part of my mind where I was couple years ago, I'm scared that if I do I will not have the power to leave from there again. 
 There is maybe more things to this bud some of them are minor or I will remember them later.

 I try to insert myself into groups and seeing them so comfortable and close with each other just makes me feel worse. There's this guy in it that I have a massive crush on. I'd be happy enough to be good friends but he just ignored my text and I guess we'll have to stay as acquaintances. Not that I thought I was as cool and funny as him or his friends but I didn't need another slap in the face saying I'm not good enough. 

I sleep 11 hours a day and when I get up I'm too tired or unmotivated to study. When I'm out with them I drink way more to loosen up and I know he drinks alone sometimes so somehow I'm trying to impress him hoping he'd ask me to drink with him someday.

522,Body confident after a period of emotional hell?,"I went through hell last year. A lot of it I don't really remember (probably a trauma response based on past experiences.) I went days without food or sleep. I had no money because my parents took a lot of it from.me. I went through so many things that nobody should have to. It is what it is. I only survived because I went to college. 

I weighed 200 back in June. I weigh 154 now. I went to the doctor because there could be a ton of different causes. All the tests came back normal. The bilirubin and thyroid were elevated but they have stabilized. The only thing is that my ribcage is exposed. I showed someone a picture of me back in June. They asked me who that was because I look completely different than I do now. 

In no way am I trying to downplay the affects of depression. I actually kind of feel guilty because I know that some people work really hard to lose weight and I achieved it without doing anything. 

Side notes: My parents told me that I looked healthy weight wise. When we saw each other during Christmas I told them I didn't want them bringing up my weight because I didn't really like the way achieved it. 

I think I unintentionally did an intermittent fasting but I don't know.

As of right now I'm doing a lot better mentally than I was last year.

The doctors don't really know what even is wrong with me, is it depression, anxiety, adhd, ASD, a mix of some or all, or plus anything else? don't know and they also say they don't know until I react to medicine.

Last October I started escitalopram, I guess it reduced anxiety but other than that I stayed the same, then in January they added Bupropion, it was giving me a lot of anxiety so then they added Mirtazapine to counter it but basically I just have the same amount of anxiety that I had before escitalopram.
So basically now I'm on 3 different antidepressants and I feel the same as I felt before October, the same I've felt for a decade, I'm 24 and it was only last year that I was able to make myself go see a psychiatrist

I'm losing hope in medication, and I'm losing hope I will ever know what is wrong with me.
I live with my gf, when she isn't home I can't even cook just for myself. I can't wash the dishes, can barely take a shower with a lot of effort, almost never wash my teeth, leaving the bed is hard, I couldn't focus on college plus it was making me so anxious that I dropped out out of the blue after started crying in the classroom, I just cant do anything, I don't want to do anything, and even when I want its really hard. The other day I went to the bathroom and then stayed looking at the toothbrush trying to grab it for a minute or two but I just couldn't make my body move 

I don't fill like I will ever be fixed and a lot of times I really just wanna end it"
524,Depressed about college,"TW: few mentions of suicide

I seriously don't know how other other people are able to have a college life like in the movies. It's either they're good at hiding their problems, they have a few problems/minor problems, or they know how to cope with the stress.

As for myself, I can't help but feel depressed about college and what the future semesters and school years will look like. I get anxiety because, while we definitely learn a lot, the requirements and submissions can really stress anyone out when in reality, I feel like I can learn these things without having to work with a group or make a video presentation on x and y. It's crazy. 

I really really do work hard. Hell, I once got the highest grade in my class. However, I feel like my priorities and goals have shifted and I want to chase things outside of university. College has made me feel so depressed and suicidal several times in my life. I remember looking at the buildings of our campus and figuring out which buildings are tall enough for me to jump off of. That's how depressing and anxiety-inducing college had gotten for me.

I wish I knew how to go about this :<<"
525,"I don't enjoy anything anymore. In fact, I don't really feel much in general.","So I have been depressed most of my life, but over the last 2 years, it has gotten so much worse. I am finally at a point where I really just work and sleep. I don't have hobbies anymore, and as a result, I really don't have friends either. My passion used to be storytelling, experiencing, and telling stories no matter the medium. But at this point, I don't enjoy any of that anymore; I just pace around my room when I have free time.  


The other day, I tried watching my favorite movie Howl's Moving Castle, and I felt nothing. I then tried re-downloading my favorite game Enderal, and again, nothing. I am scared to try re-reading my favorite book, The Name of the Wind because that is my favorite piece of fiction in general, and if I feel nothing from that, then... I don't know what will be left.  


But like I said, enjoyment is just the tip of the iceberg here; I don't really feel happy ever, nor do I really feel sad or anything like that. I am simply empty."
526,lost,"i don't think i'll ever be able to live my life freely, there's always going to be something i'm worried about. i get one problem sorted out and there's already another waiting to be solved, i'm constantly asking people for help, advice, reassurance and support. they're probably so sick of me, i feel like the only thing i do is ruminate in my thoughts. every time i think i'm getting better something always comes up and i end up in the same place i was before. i can't even complain because i'm the reason why things are the way they are, i don't even do the things i enjoy anymore, i spend way too much time in my head thinking things over and over, people keep saying things will get better but they don't know me at all or what goes on in my head. "
527,am I suicidal,"for context, I am a college student and I believe I am suffering from moderate depression based on my symptoms, which also run very heavily in my family. I am actively seeking to gain a diagnosis right now.

I often think about killing myself, but I never truly consider it. I just think about the circumstances of how people would react to my death. it has been so hard for me to get out of bed in the mornings, that to me, sleeping is like romanticizing with death and I think about what it would be like to sleep and never wake up.

sometimes when I sit on the roof of my apartment complex, I look over the edge and think about what it would be like to jump.

&#x200B;

the thing is, I consider all these scenarios in my head, but I never truly have the intent to do anything so extreme. It's like my mind is subconsciously flirting with the thought of death in a really weird masochistic way, but I never would truly consider it. I think about those around me and love them too much to ever hurt them like that.

should I still seek help and is this a problem worth addressing or are these normal thoughts. thank you."
528,Can you overcome depression on your own and without meds?,"I (M35) tried a couple of therapists, but I didn’t like it. Doing that took so much effort. I know you have to find the right one for yourself but it seems that I squeezed out the last drop of motivation regarding this.

I started working on things to feel better: I cleaned the flat, got a haircut, started eating healthy (I stopped eating last year and became extremely underweight), started working out, reached out to friends.

I definitely notice an improvement, except for the days when I don’t. My plan is to continue with the healthy lifestyle, start being more social, and resolving some physical health issues… Can I cure myself? Or is this something super inadvisable?"
529,Life is terrible,"Life's going down and down.  
  
No close people, living abroad, no job, trying to contact parents (the only family I have) is worse than staying no contact, overall feeling tired of life and not seeing any positive future for myself."
530,When does overdosing kill you?,I started drinking acetaminophen pills a few days ago 8 tablets a day its been 3 days and I start to show some symptoms when does it kill me?
531,How much of depression is based on genetics? ,To what extent is one’s depression inherited?
532,I have a feeling that I have clinical depression. Should I give a go with antidepressants?,"I have been depressed for a long long time. Recently in my life there has been a lot of changes. I have a lot more friends than I used to have, I have a somewhat healthy social life, I have a supportive girlfriend. But still I get these really nasty depressive episodes. I always thought if my social problems came to an end my problems would go with it. But no, I still cannot bring myself to do the things that I want to do. I have big ambitions, I feel motivated and I feel like I could achieve the things that I want to achieve but I cannot bring myself to actually do the steps towards them. I just physically don't enjoy doing productive things even though I want to and it is so annoying and I don't know how to deal with it. I feel like this problem is holding me back so much. 

I have started to think that I have clinical depression and that I may need antidepressants. I can't fish out the enjoyment of doing actual things like reading or studying or improving in my hobbies. The only time when I feel somewhat happy is either partying or being with my girlfriend. I have always avoided antidepressants as im afraid of becoming dependent on them. What should I do?"
533,Missed a few days of anti depressant,"On 100mg Setraline / Zoloft, and I missed 2-3 days of the meds as I ran out and my doctor took a while to prescribe me more. I've had super bad insomnia (which I have a history of). I started Setraline about a month ago and my insomnia actually got better and life was going pretty smooth. I've had a few misses but I'm going to be more disciplined with it.

Just wondering if insomnia is common after stopping and when I can expect to go back to where I was at?"
534,Feeling really lost ,"I’m just tired of waking up every at 2am everyday by a wave of anxiety for the next day because I know the mental gymnastics I’m about to go through. I’ve been through a lot and I feel it’s all finally catching up to me. I can’t stay in this exhausted survival state. Like the depression doesn’t feel the same this time, like I’ve numbed out so much that it’s my constant now. I also have mania and that’s the only side the world sees, my social is bright and when I talk to people I’m always a motivator and try to give them optimism because I would love the same. However, it’s isolating, and I truly have no one in my life so no support. I already tried therapy and I am tired of the therapist saying the same shit, “it’s not you that’s the problem, it’s the world” well that shit doesn’t help. I do have my medication but that doesn’t stop me from waking up every night and only helps as fast as I can get it in my mouth. I do a lot of social activities and sports to stay distracted and I’m an extrovert but then it’s a vicious cycle of exhaustion.  The people I connect with are scattered about the world, and because of where I live people don’t stay long so I always lose the friends I make. (5 people so far). I don’t know what solution I’m looking for, I’m just exhausted and don’t see a solution, maybe a hug. "
535,Tw suicidal thoughts ,"I think if I’d have doubled my alcohol I’d be able to do it. Grab a knife, easy. Let it fall. Too late afterwards. I wish I weren’t such a pussy."
536,I’m struggling,"I’m struggling lately because I feel so lost. I feel so disconnected from everything and everyone. Most of my close friends live across the world, are too busy for me, or both. I’m more alone now than I’ve ever felt in my entire life, and I’m having a horrible time trying to survive. I’ve tried dating apps just to meet people, but literally everyone I message just stops replying after a day. The very few times it doesn’t happen, it goes nowhere, and I just start losing all motivation to even leave my room. 
The few things in life I enjoy doing im not even good at. It makes me feel like putting effort into things is a waste because everything I put time into just falls apart turning out to just be a big waste of time. Anytime my friends and I play competitive games, I lose pretty much every time. It’s so frustrating because I have loads of fun in the moment, but then I second guess every move I make and hate myself immensely for not being able to improve. 
I’ve tried applying for jobs but no one’s called me back. They’re not even fancy jobs they’re just barista type gigs, or thrift shop jobs. 
Currently, I have no one in my life I can talk to about my struggles. No one that will listen without judgement or trying to solve my struggles, and therapy is just too expensive. 
Lately my sleep schedule has been so garbage. Some days I get into bed at 3 in the morning before passing out, and other days I sleep through the day or night just to kill time.
I have no planned future. When I was in junior high nearly 10 years ago now, I decided that I wouldn’t have a future, so I’d just off myself when I felt I was ready. I planned so because with the political situations rising constantly, the world at war constantly, global warming, that there just would be no future for me to live for. To me school or a career path just looked like a waste of time. My goal was to survive long enough to travel. Now that I’ve succeeded in my task I feel like I have no purpose. If I’m being honest I don’t feel like my mindset has change much since then either.
But even if I did focus on a career path, I feel like there’s nothing I’m good at. One of my worst traits is that I’m incredible at doing something on my first try, but immediately wash up and become as mediocre as humanly possible. I just want to have one talent that I feel confident could turn into a career. One single thing that I could use as a reason to want a future. 
I’ve just struggled for so long to see any bigger picture. I guess if I have any question or advice to look for, I would ask what people do to deal with crippling depression. How do I motivate myself to care about having a future when I can’t even imagine a future for my kid if I were to have one.

537,I wish to die ,"Man, i just wish to disappear from existence. "
538,I always said I was one tragedy away from ending it all... well recent events have put this to the test.,"So here I am, sitting in an airport bawling my eyes out.

I am a 35 year old male, who left one Western country for another to pursue a once in a lifetime, job sponsorship opportunity.I have suffered from Depression, Anxiety, Agoraphobia, and Paranoia for years and always felt on the brink of ending it all. 

However, whenever I took a vacation to the country I am currently in (been here 15 times now), I always felt, happy, whole, familiar, like I was meant to be here. I just smile whenever I walk it's medieval streets. I always tell my friends ""perhaps I came from here in a past life.""

Well my anxiety caused me to choke during the interview, I shut down, I fumbled something I should have nailed in retrospect. So I must go back home. The country in question is changing their visa rules effectively cutting me off moving forward. 

This has caused me to reflect on everything that I lack. My one dimensional education, my one dimensional job history, my constant pessimism, negativity and hatred of myself.

So now I am in a deep dark spiral of depression I do not see myself getting out of. I HATE myself and I do not want to exist anymore. There is no getting past this. I am done. Thanks for listening."
539,How do I extend the same level of kindness to myself that I do for others? ,"I don't get it. People will be going through a hard time and I will tell them what I would want to hear in that situation. I feel like I'm able to give sound advice to people and offer comfort and support but I just don't know how to do it for myself...    
  
Depression is driving me fucking insane.

540,Will my insecurities ever be less than it is now?,Will my confidence boost over the years? Or can I always be stuck in the same depressing circles?
541,Misunderstood,"I’m 23, African American boy. My birth wasn’t what most have experienced(hopefully not). Originally I’m the sixth child of a family I never meet nor heard from(Let’s call them Family B).  I found out once I was 8-9 ish. I’ve came to terms with it about 14-15 ish going into high school. I’m grateful to have made it this far into life with no real harm to me. Physically I’m not the strongest but not the weakest. Mentally is a whole different story (I’ll explain later.) I’ve been raised alone as an only child due to my current family(Let’s call them Family A). My parents have gave me all the tools to succeed in life as a person in their eyes. My Mother is from a hidden out town in Texas called Lufkin as the youngest of four and my father is from the country to of Dade City Florida and he’s (to my knowledge is the youngest of his siblings.) I was born in Missouri City, Houston TX. Both my parents were Educators.(If you have or had parents as educators you know for a fact you have no real choice but to have a good act. I’m not a bad person just people don’t take time to learn about me.) My father was a PE teacher All through my life in Elementary. He even made the decision to hold me back a year so I can be around the same age group of kids so I can make friends.(The reason that was is because of my Birthday. I was born later in life. Lemme explain in better terms. Imagine the youngest and smallest kid in the room who had no business being there.) Anyway growing up I was always known as “Coach Jones Son/ Boy”  Due to the fact my father being at the school for 30 or so years. He full retired from school teachings in 2019 the same year I graduated High School. Remembering back to wat I can remember I was always my father’s shadow for how he was the best teacher known in that district. He taught former students kids, former city figures and more. My father also had a lawn care service with him me and my mother. (We didn’t have much but we made something outta nothing.) All through those years I honestly never learned anything. I’m not dumb nor a slacker. I just didn’t see how any of it could help me in life and that mentality stayed with me till now in fact. I grew up around preppy white kids and rare but uncommon rich ppl. The school was diverse but majority White American. About 75 close to 80%. So I didn’t really have much close friends to make beside my friends in my neighborhood( Who were black lol). I didn’t rlly start going to a dominant black school until I started middle school and high school and holy fuck it was worse. No let’s dive back into why mentally I’m not comfortable with anything. When I found out I was adopted I didn’t make much of it. I didn’t know what it meant. My mom said I was blessed, but I rather think I was a burden. Just a reusable, like thrift store clothes or an empty water bottle. Once my so called friends made jokes, always said shit  “my opinion didn’t” or “Imagine being a reject”. Till this day I can never stop hearing ppl say that. Middle school was were I honestly thought I’d kill my self for the fact I didn’t know how to be an actual person. You know, express myself in a positive way to grow as a whole you know. I just wanted to keep everything in a me only perspective. But it was hard. If you’ve heard the saying “Smile through the pain or See the pain through his eyes” that I AM the living experience. I’ve always been a kind soul through and through. Even if I didn’t cause the issue I was in, I’d try to make it clear there was no foul in anything, but I still felt as if I was the cause. I just always felt like the problem. Since then I’ve felt that that way even right now. Anyway going into high school wasn’t the best but who start is the best anyway. I started at the main school everyone in the area went to which was the closest then changed to a new school that was brand new to the district. So a fresh start for me. But I’ll let you guess how those last three year of high school went? If you said good then you’re wrong. If you said bad the you’re wrong. It was the most FRUSTRATING I’ve been in my life. I never went to a party, never been to a school club. Barley went to socials. I didn’t even evolve educationally. I honestly couldn’t fathom how much others were way above me everything. And what made it worse is that my grades were so bad my family made the school change my learning compared to other students. When big tests were happening I was cut off from classes and separated from friends I’ve made so I can “Improve”. I was basically in jail while in school. The only time I felt free was in athletics which only had my interest because of my dad. My dad back in the day played for the  Oakland A’s and Philadelphia Phillies farm teams and Mexico League as well. I’d played baseball most life because of him. He was happy to see me play when I did. But deep down I knew I wasn’t gonna grow nor gain the talent most others did. So I did the best I can with my body handle. So I played all through high school. I was on varsity all 3 yrs but mostly played as a bench player. Wasn’t happy but I did make my father proud. Wish I can say I could’ve done better in my classes but to be honest I lost complete interest in it. All I knew was hard labor. Since I was put to work cutting lawns for the family with him to put extra money in our pockets. My senior year was prob the scariest of my life for the fact I almost lost my father twice(I’ll save for another story time). After graduating( barely) I took a yr off school to make money and focus on what I wanted to do.  I decided to go to community college just to see if I can even get a degree. I got my Associate degree in Dec 2021.( If you remember how bad the world was during the time then you know how tough that was during quarantine). That time drove me into a spiraling state of depression that even friends to this day will always remember. My life is my prison. I didn’t chose it I was brought into it. All gas no breaks. I still live with my family after some finacial decisions have changed my path.  Some say I should have an easy life. You know a college a diploma, no felonies/bad record, a car and even a good paying job. I’m lost. I see my friends doing their thing and I’m being left behind like I felt being adopted at birth. I just wanna me be normal and happy but these days you gotta pay to be happy but I still at least. 

I don’t know if anyone would read this but please, any older audiences please lend me a bit of your wisdom or advice. It would mean the world to me. 
•On a positive note I make music to help keep my depression and dark thought from rising to help relieve stress like I used to but even that isn’t enough. I wanna make clothes, I wanna make music with my friends who have had my back. But my family treat my ideas as things that won’t help me survive on my own. And we all know time won’t stop for no one.

My responsabilities are very hard to do but also I dont know how to have fun and feel good right now, Ive been having a headache all day and I just default to scrolling which could make me slip and get me back in a hole so how the hell am I supposed to get better now that i have a clear head?"

While part of that is my fault I feel like a burden, like a waste of space and time. Like instead of touching something and it turns to gold, it turns to shit. Becoming sober from drink and drugs was the best thing I could’ve done and I don’t indulge till this day, so is it sad that I’m even this way when I’m sober. 
I don’t have hope in anyone or anything, I don’t want to eat, I have nothing to wear to my new office job, I’m burdening my landlord by not being able to pay my rent this month and last month. I gave her every last penny I had, evens if I went hungry. I have an amazing man helping me but I feel like he’d be better off if I didn’t exist in his life, like he never met me. I let the one thing I feel like connected us, go. 
I’m in extreme debt and it’s not about the amount cause the amount is low (nowhere past $5000) but so is my credit score.

Doctor recommended a sleep study but those folks referred me back saying they are just trying to get me on heavy sleeping meds when my issue is really untreated depression.  I can’t take it anymore.

No one calls up my phone, I rarely get invited anywhere, my friends seem to be slowly distancing themselves from me and also I fumbled the only girl that was ever interested in me because Im simply a POS.

So It all boils down to me just not feeling generally good about myself, I dont really like the guy I see in the mirror, I feel like a slight burden to my parents because of how useless I am in comparison to other people.

Sometimes I just be having thoughts that everyone would be better off if I just never existed, its like Im an oxygen waster, a bad person.

Ever since my mom passed away (a month before my 18th) life just hasn’t been easy. And I think that’s the reason I don’t like to celebrate my birthday or any milestones. It just reminds me all over again that she’s not here. It’s crazy. You’d think “hey, she has a good life” but that doesn’t stop my mind from wandering and thinking of a million little things to knock me down. Depression really has a hold on me, I’ve never actually spoke to anybody about it and I’m sure that’s why it’s gotten worse. I find myself crying almost every other day for any little thing. It stays bottled up (I don’t recommend btw). I gave myself this little gift (tattoo). It’s small and simple, but means so much. I haven’t attempted suicide and I don’t think I ever would. Because I’m scared. I’ve had the thoughts. Ive planned it in my head a couple of times. I know I would never be able to go through with it though. I have kids. I can’t leave them motherless. No one would protect them the way I will. They are the reason I stay. They’re the reason I want to get better. ❤️‍🩹

558,Single after spending half my life with someone,"Throwaway account. 

Last year I (25m) got a divorce from my wife (24f). We were highschool sweethearts and moved in together after. To make a long story short, there mistakes made by myself primarily, but she made her fair share and it came back to haunt out marriage. We ended up agreeing to divorce since we knew it wasn't going to work out anymore.

Well, it's been about a year since then and naturally, I was depressed as hell at first, I loved that girl beyond words. But, as divorces go, those feelings are VERY gone now. 

I met someone and had an fwb for a few months after and it helped alot with realizing things were going to get better. I felt like there was hope. We started to catch feelings for each other and I had to back away. Idk why I did but I got scared I guess.

Now I've been truly single again for a few months, and it's like I'm back to square one. I have NO sex drive, I can't sleep some nights, and im just mentally exhausted 24/7. I keep thinking of my ex wife and how good the good times were, and how much I miss having a PARTNER in life. 

I know better than to get into a new relationship with these feelings, but I just feel fucking lonely. I don't know what to do anymore."
559,Struggling with Depression: My Experience Seeking Help in Germany,"Hey guys, I'm from Germany, so forgive me if my English isn't perfect.

I'm 26 now and I've been suffering from depression for several years. The thoughts have been getting worse to the point where I didn't care about what would happen to my girlfriend and family if I took my own life. In November, I finally found the courage to talk to the doctor about it, which was really difficult for me. My general practitioner then referred me to a day clinic where I got an appointment on February 26, 2024. It took a lot of effort for me to bring it up at the day clinic, as I'm very reserved and I don't want to bother anyone with my problem because everyone has their own problems. But I did talk about it and was well received. They gave me the medication quetiapine and I also felt comfortable. The next day was my first therapy session and I was also ready for group and individual sessions, after all, I had decided to seek treatment on my own.

I don't know how it is in other countries, but in Germany, in a day clinic, you get an individual plan tailored to you, which includes things like group therapy at 9:00 a.m., pottery at 11:00 a.m., etc. I told the doctor that I didn't feel ready to do occupational therapy or pottery. I also said that if I made any pottery there, I would just throw it away at home because I don't need it, it would be a waste of resources, and I don't see how it would help me. Besides, my pottery would always remind me of the lowest point in my life. But my doctor wasn't understanding at all and said, ""I wouldn't confront my fears."" Even though I would participate in all the conversations. He also gave the example (I work as a retail salesman at Kaufland) and said, ""It's like if I say I won't go to Kaufland because it's not a supermarket."" I thought the comparison was so stupid; he's a psychologist who works with depressed people and compares pottery with a shop he won't shop at... The doctor then discharged me directly from the day clinic and said I was banned from there. I honestly find it so stupid that on the one hand they say they'll take care of you so you'll get better, but on the other hand, you're left alone with your problem because you don't want to do pottery, even though there could be other activities during that time...

Now I went to my general practitioner to ask for a psychologist to talk to, but the doctor wasn't there and I talked to the assistant at the reception... Privacy was completely top again... She said it's impossible to get a psychologist and I should try again at the day clinic... I feel so abandoned as if none of the non-depressed people understand me. I'm also too proud to go back to the day clinic if I've been told by a doctor the day before that I'm the problem and I'm closing myself off from everything even though I just want to talk... I don't want to do crafts or sports, I want to talk... I really don't know what else I can do right now."
560,"I have a deep gut feeling that in the next three years or earlier, I will be dead.","When I think to the future, my future, I see absolutely nothing at all. Just completely blank. And not in a ""I don't know where I'll be in [X] years way"" but it genuinely is just blank. I don't think I'll be alive then. I don't even care, I wouldn't have lived a fulfilling life anyway. I just wish I could tell the people around me without it looking like a cry for help. I don't want them to be hurt by it when I'm gone, or feel like it was their fault. No one can change the path I'm set on, except myself. And I'm not strong enough."
561,Sometimes I want to drive off a bridge ,"Yesterday was 8 months since my son passed. I’m not getting any better and all I hear is how strong I am for returning to work as soon as I did. I don’t feel strong. I’m barely holding it together. I knew if I stayed home, I’d never do anything ever again. And I’m now daydreaming about ending it all. I don’t know what to do anymore. "
562,I’m ready to end it,"I wanna die, mainly because I can’t be a normal person anymore because of the physical, mental, emotional, and verbal abuse I suffered from 6, 8 and 10-15yrs old. My life has no meaning and if I die, the world will just go on, I’m insignificant and dying won’t change anything in the world."
563,Depression in a Relationship,"I am a senior in college, my last semester before graduation and have been in a 3 year relationship with my current girlfriend. I struggle with major depression, anxiety, and OCD.  She's been there for me through so much but as of lately she's become this overly negative person that has ruined friendships I have with other people and made me more depressed in a way. I already have pre-existing depression and I understand she struggles with things too but her overabundant amount of negativity brings me down so far sometimes. I've been neglecting myself trying to give her the world to make her happy, just to see even an inch of that smile that I once saw so long ago but it seems all in vain. I finally decided to put up boundaries to take care of myself and start looking out for myself, to end that cycle of neglection that has destroyed my mental health. These boundaries were simple, I wanted some more time to myself at night and she took this as I was trying to get away from her and break up with her so that's what she told our friends. That is not what I said at all, I'm just trying to prioritize myself for once in my life as I'm hurting so bad and some days I don't know if I'll even make it to next week. Thank you for listening to what I have to say, love to all of my fellow humans out there may you find love and light in your life. "
564,Tired of Depression ,I am 43 this year and have had depression and anxiety since my mid twenties and I'm just sick and tired of it now I've got no friends no partner and the only reason I am alive is because it would destroy my parents if I killed myself we have talked about this and they made me promise not to take my own life but everyday is a struggle and every night when I go to bed I wish that I would never wake up 
565,I'm so fucking useless,Just finished crying in the shower. There really is nothing waiting for me in life. I have no value. I have no skills. I have no positive traits. I have no passion. I have no talent. I have no goals. I am nothing. Worthless. I will never be anything to anyone. I've hurt everyone who has ever cared about me. I'm fucking disgusting. I'm a net negative. I'm a waste of resources. I can't even take care of myself. I need to just end it already. No one even cares. This post is just me screaming into the void - no one really wants to hear. 
566,Being a teenager sucks,"Honestly, I am in my early teens, but life have been so fucking hard rn, and like I can’t handle it. My parents say that I’m not doing well at all in school, even tho I got straight As and a few Bs, and yeah. I know I could do better, but they’re already preparing me for SSAT, like wat? Also, recently my crush rejected me and we’re not fricken friends anymore. I hate that. I AM NOT FUCKIN GOOD ENOUGH, NOT ENOUGH FOR ANYONE TO BE NOTICED, ETC ETC. IM SO STUPID I CANT EVEN THINK OF ANYTHING. LIFE, WTF!. Just needed to let that out guys. Phew."
567,What if the root cause of my depression cannot be treated?,"I’ve heard quite some saying that find and fix what caused me depression in the first place may help. But what if it cannot be fixed? Like dear family member passed away or medical misconduct that cause your permanent trauma

I wouldn’t be here if all problems have a solution and if all damage can be reversed. My parents always say I am thinking too much and I should let go. But the problems are there and they cannot be fixed. If I live, the problems live with me.

I’d definitely be happy if I can fix every problem but there are so many damages that are irreversible "
568,Need to be seen and heard ,"I'm having a day where I can't get out of bed. Verbally stringing a sentence together is effort, I feel like im drowning. I spoke to a doctor and they signed me off work for a week while I continue to engage with my usual medication and therapy. But I've been doing that since I was 18, I'm now 31. Things are particularly tough at the moment, I'm in the process of separating and moving out. So I know low times are to be expected. But im 6 months into a new job and while my direct line manager is so so supportive (work has been a real trigger for me in the past so this is amazing) she has said that upper management are pressuring her to improve my attendance so there are some concerns. If I lose this job I really truly have nothing. But im sure you can relate to those days where you just CANNOT function. And if I somehow got myself out of bed and presentable for work and could stop crying constantly, with the thoughts going on in my head right now i don't think it would be safe to drive. I have maybe 2 people I can share this with, but they both lean on me to try and get into work even when I'm struggling to simply exist. I know its important, but I guess I just want someone to see how hard I'm trying and tell me its completely okay to take my time when the battle is this hard. But that's not life, you have to keep going regardless. I'm not cut out for this life and its showing. Any words of understanding would really soothe me right now. I know I can be better than this, but today isn't the day"
569,i feel numb (14f),"just need to rant, honestly. sorry if it’s long.
(tw for mentions of self harming)

there is nothing in my life going on right now that should make me feel how i do and i hate myself for it. there are so many people in worse situations than me. i have good grades, good home life etc.

but i just feel numb. i don’t even know if sad is the right word anymore. a few nights ago i relapsed self harming (2 years) and i liked it. ive been doing it more and i can’t bring myself to feel any guilt whatsoever about it. i also don’t want to stop. i can’t bring myself to cry, i want to so badly; but everything just feels stuck.

i like my friends and i want what’s best for them. they think im funny so i go to school and i want to see them smile and laugh, because they deserve it. then i get home and don’t know what to do, so ill get into bed at 8 but not sleep until the crack of dawn. i don’t even feel anxious or anything, i just lie there awake because my body doesn’t want to sleep.

ive tried reflecting on myself, and i don’t think i even really know who i am anymore. i don’t know my favourite colour. i couldn’t tell you my favourite food or movie, or my dislikes. i do not know. im not sure when i stopped knowing.

i don’t know what to do. life feels so wrong, i just wake up everyday and wait for it to be night again. i go to school to see my friends smile. i can’t think of anything else. i used to finish a book in 3 days, haven’t picked one up in weeks. i don’t want to watch a show, i don’t want to talk to anybody. i don’t want to do anything. 

i have a history with mental health, but i can’t remember those times much. i remember getting sent to a hospital when i was 9 for suicidal thoughts, but those memories don’t feel as real as now. this feels very different. i promised myself i would never be suicidal again because i saw how sad it made everyone around me, and im not suicidal now. sometimes, though, i wonder what would happened if i did die. i don’t want to kill myself but i can’t imagine myself in the future. it’s weird. 

anyways, thanks for reading if you got this far. i just needed to get some things off my chest because nobody around me needs to know this. i don’t know if im depressed or just in a bad mood, but i don’t think it matters. we’re all going through something over here lol."
570,I'm super morbidly obese and am so depressed than I'm not eating.,"I had half of a single-serving yogurt cup this morning and 12 hours later ordered a pizza to see if that helped.  I ate one slice.  Being so overweight (previously almost 200 lbs over my ideal weight), it doesn't take much thought to figure out that eating is my favorite thing to do.  It's a very addictive hobby.  And I usually love to cook and try new recipes!

I'm losing weight like crazy.  Which is awesome!  But this is not the way I want to do it...  I have no appetite and, thus, no energy from not eating.  The good thing is that I'm not dealing with the urge to cut/sh like I normally would when depressed.  I think this is why it snuck up on me.

I am going to take my first shower in almost two weeks as soon as I post this.  Ugh...  I could really use someone to talk to one-on-one.  I am so lonely.  I have no friends and my closest family is an hour away.  I can't drive.  I'm pretty much a shut-in."
571,I should go mute,"I have nothing to add the noise of the world. I just complain, make excuses, or seemingly annoy people. I have no friends, my coworkers don't talk to me, supervisors know I'm a fake,  my family doesn't talk to me, and my spouse looks at me like I'm an idiot half the time. On top of everything else I have a goddamn speech impediment so it's twice as hard to physically understand me.  Aaaaaaahhhhh!"
572,Emotionally exhausted ,"I hope someone here can relate to what I’m going through here. Had a melt down tonight and I just want to put it all out there and hold myself accountable to move forward.

I’m in my early 30’s, been at the edge several times since my teens, and only got diagnosed with depression in my mid twenties. 

Have struggled throughout my adult life, to find doctors in California work with me on the medication front. No issues with behavioral therapy at least, although I do go out of network for that, and I love my therapist. 

I’ve been subscribed sub-clinical doses of multiple meds at different times, or given straight up wrong information. For example: take mirtazapene in the morning (making me a sleepy and irritable). Only now am I on 150 mg of Effexor (after being on 32 for entirely too long), but I’m always hot and sweaty, headachy and my GI tract is not happy. When I complain about the side affects, my doctor (Kaiser Permanente) blames periods and is reluctant to do anything because I’m not suicidal.

Throughout this, I’ve built a solid career as an environmental engineer over the last decade. The wrinkle is that my role as a CUPA/CA county haz mat inspector, uses all of my social battery. I do my best to put facilities at ease, display that even though I’m a young woman, I know how industry works (from being a hands on consultant, working at the dreaded tesla factory and a DOE/govt research lab) and be funny and kind. 

After a 10 hour day inspecting 2-3 facilities (yeah we do 4-10’s and I’m not thrilled) I’m beat. Like non-verbal beat. 

To give an example, after a long day at a networking conference, I had to rush down to photograph my boyfriend at work as this is his last season working for an NHL hockey franchise. I awkwardly rushed to my seat in between plays and bumped some people’s legs when they didn’t stand up. I thought I asked to get to my seat and waited a sec seconds, but this group disagreed. One of women made a sharp remark to me sending me back to being that quiet bullied kid in 2nd grade. Another woman criticized me while I was still crying. I think I deserved grace, but hey, this isn’t about them.

I know I need to keep fighting the medical establishment to get meds that actually work. 

Probably switch to a 5 day schedule so I’m not so dead and can make more time for my hobbies and friends. Thankful to have a handful of wonderful friends (and fur babies) that I can be real with, but oh man, shit is still hard.

Hope this wasn’t too rambly, and that you know you’re not alone.

573,How do not feel “sad” every minute of my life?,"Does it ever end? Do I even get an hour without questioning everything? Am I capable of being content, ok, enough again? 

Or is having this damned inner voice forever? I want to drown the whispers of nothing is good, nothing is ok, everything is doomed and I will keep progressing worse over the years and live a life full of regrets, anxiety and sadness.

4 months ago my life was completely normal, I want it back and I want this over!

574,"I feel like i need someone to talk to, without judging.","I felt like life has led me to a rather worn down road, with bodies all around me, surrounding me, suffocating each breath that I take. It has come to the point where I feel I cant breathe. I can’t think right. I just need a breather. A safe space that I can call home. A space where all things, including the people closest to me, will disappear just for a brief moment. I just felt like I needed that serenity, that calm and that peace. Where I can be myself. Looking out into the distance, enjoying the scintillating stars in space, floating around Saturn’s rings, walking around a volcano. 

Im writing this to express how I feel about my life. Im being controlled and used. And I have no one else to talk to about it that wont judge me. I have no best friends because of my attitude. Im alone. But to me, being alone is a dream. And that dream will be actualized in a few more days when the person closest to me will go to her workplace. I feel happy, I feel blissful that I don’t have to pretend anymore. Im tired of pretending you know? 

I love her, but… its different. Its like im loving an entirely different person 3 years go. Not the person that I used to know. I preferred the previous one. The one that loved me for who I am, without concerns about my money. The one who talked to me without judging. The one who actually respected me as a man. I feel broken, I feel pathetic, I feel sad. I just want to be loved for who I am. Without pretending. I feel like I lost all my confidence and my pride. And I don’t know who else I can tell this to without being judged, and without the story spreading to others. I have no one that I can trust. "
575,"It's definitely gone. The last option and hope to vent and be understood died before my eyes. (Just antother Vent here, TLDR: fuck inhuman people)","In my 20s, man.

I've been dealing with this mental illness since the end of 2k19.

I've never been able to tell anyone about the suicidal thoughts and fucked up ideas, ideas that run through my mind permanently in a constant loop.

The closest I came to talking about this was in one of those tortuous, peaceful endless early mornings.I had this empty idiot face and my mom found me staring at the wall for 20 minutes straight until I finally realized she was there.

It took her 2 years to realize I was sick, and when she confronted me about it, her reaction was a ""meh, ok"".

And from that reaction, I instantly understood that I was already screwed.

My family is that ""type"" of family.
That family where they manage to be totally ignorant stupid in the sense of understanding the importance of mental health.

They believe and summarize that having this disease is just ""being a little sad."" Ignoring and unaware of everything else that comes the fact of this sicknes.

I thought maybe they could understand it in the long run, I was wrong, very wrong.

When I saw that it was foolishly useless to even try to express myself, I instantly dismissed it. I did it out of fear, difficulty, and total reluctance.

And so the years went by, suffering and having a hard time almost permanently. I live in a constant dispute with my mother and older brother, always angry with me for the permanent disinterest and for how absolutely unproductive I am.

Even I don't know how I continue to survive the constant and heavy episodes. Day by day, everything is even worse and I'm reaching the last extremes. Not many weeks ago, I took a knife from the kitchen, it was almost unsharpened. And since I was always a complete coward, I didn't dare to touch my veins, instead, I cut off my upper arm, as if from a small attack of cat's claws.

I felt like a monster, not because of what I did, but because it calmed me down, and I even laughed a little at how pathetic it all was.

Obviously, the outages didn't close overnight.

My mother discovered them at a lunch and accused me about this, I managed to evade the truth by saying that I made them while repairing the metal curtain in the house.

She barely believed it and said, ""I don't want you to be like your aunt.""She never talks about her, the only thing I knew, was that she died in a motorcycle accident along with her partner.

Turns out I found out that my aunt had active suicide attempts. Sometimes trying to throw themselves under the wheels of cars, sometimes playing Russian roulette, sometimes cutting themselves more deadly.

And in those anecdotes she told me as I listened with my stupid face, I finally accepted the truth. The truth is that I'm never going to be on the same page as them. The truth is that they will never understand me, and most importantly.

They're never going to take me seriously.

My mother called my aunt ""someone who did all of that to get simply attention.""

They didn't give a fuck when my aunt called for help in that way.

 So, what's left for me?

How do I make aware this mental problema to people that sees suicide as a fucking joke?


What I can do? Am I really going to spend the last 2/4 years of my useless life so lonely and disconnected from everything? I've fought silently for too many years, and this is how it all ends?... 

Do you know what is the funniest thing? that I really love these idiots called ""family"" with everything I have left in my soul. They are the only thing I have, and while I know how extremely toxic and damaging this is, they are the only thing I still care about in this disgusting, insensitive society and world.

I just can't get to the end point. As much as I long for suicide every day of my life, I don't want to be that selfish. I want to at least die after my mother. I don't want her to suffer. I don't want it, despite all the permanent damage she does to me without realizing it, Mom, I love you with the little I still have

 If you made it this far, simply thank you for reading. I think it's better to talk to strangers about this than to keep all of this in my damaged, disgusting brain.

 I hope you and I one day stop suffering."
576,Light.,"Im not sure exactly when I became “depressed.” All my life I have been more or less optimistic and always have had a better perspective of the world (Glass half full.) After a few setbacks due to “self sabotage,”etc. I never knew how disgusting it could feel to be alive. The pain was indescribable at most. For the majority of the time I could barely explain how I felt to a therapist because I couldn’t even comprehend it myself. I was left dumbfounded at my own dilemma since I could usually overcome batches of depression with a tint of my naturally made optimism and what not. Yet, this merciless monster would not leave my domain. I would have inclinations of hope, but after a while they would dissipate after my own would subconsciously remind me that I was alone, lost, and afraid. It was physical almost. I thought maybe I had a tumor in a part of my brain that was keeping me this way. All in all, I knew to a degree. That this was more or less my fault. It has gotten a bit better, but I have a-lot to do to get back to the point where I was before. It hasn’t been easy of course. Especially considering that I foresaw no chance of ever feeling as “happy” as I was a few years ago. I thought the sea of black sludge would always be around me til the day I died. There was a life before and after my depression. This is the farthest id gone hopefully for my entire life. I just turned 23 yesterday and after a few sequences of self reflection. I am in a state of coming to terms with my disability as a reminder of what happens when you do not stay true to yourself. I have suffered this long and now it is true. Maybe in a few years I will look back at this period with gratitude. Though, one thing I never lost during and this period was my dignity and treating others kindly. Even if I saw no point in human life at one point. Im done being the greatest pessimist west of the Mississippi. Im ready to live my life eagerly again. Waiting for the truth of the world to strike me once more. For I will rise again and again as I have before."
577,i dont think that i can do this anymore,"idk why but im afraid of turning 18 its like after all these years i already know i failed at life and well i dont think im able to handle the rest if this was just the easy part im scared of this and i just dont know why this feeling wont go away maybe its because im forced in this terrible group therapy maybe its cus theres a whole ass community that hates me? maybe its because i havent done anything im proud of  and i just lose more and more hope each day and i dont know if i even want to fix it anymore its like i have absolutely just ruined my life so much that its beyond all repair and the fact that i even used to have hope sounds silly for me now i just think that after all this it just only will go down from here besides all im able to do nowadays is watch tik tok watch netflix and stay in my room all day i truly have given up at even trying

578,Feeling stuck ,"I haven’t posted before but I don’t know who else to talk to.
I’m just tired I’m tired of burdening my family and my constantly dwindling number of friends, feeling so stuck and isolated, not having anything to be proud of recently. I’m just over everything I don’t want to be around anymore it’s hard facing everyday with nothing to look forward to no real goals nothing to do. Sure I feel fleeting moments of happiness but they are getting fewer and further between. I’ve attempted before and it’s starting to feel like I might again I don’t want to hurt the people I love because I know a suicide sticks with you forever from experience but honestly I’m just holding them back making them worry wether I’m alright or not. I also don’t wanna be in a future where I actually have no one and nothing I’m scared of people dying abandoning me etc and don’t wanna wait around and see that happen. Lately I’ve just come to hate myself and especially my body i don’t even want to leave my house. I used to love to go out be around people be happy but it’s too hard. Every night lately I go to bed hoping I can just pass in my sleep and honestly if I didn’t have the religious trauma from Catholic school and wasn’t so afraid of hell I would’ve done it by now. I don’t know what to do I just feel like I’m reaching my breaking point I just want to be happy and have a good life but it just doesn’t seem possible I’m too broken. I’m not looking for pity or advice I just had to put my feelings somewhere."
579,It’s all getting bad again,"I got discharged from my IOP before I was ready because of insurance. Since I’ve been out, I have been way more depressed and my eating disorder behaviors are back. I spent the past year and a half in treatment and it’s like I made no progress as soon as I’m on my own. 

My suicidal ideation is back. The hopelessness is stronger than ever. And now I can’t sleep. My insomnia always gets worse when I’m more depressed. All I want is to go to bed, it’s the closest I can get to not being alive. But I’ve been laying here for hours and I can’t shut my thoughts off for even a second. I just want quiet.

What’s the point in getting treatment if the second I’m out of it, I revert back to being suicidal and using my eating disorder to cope? I don’t think I’ll ever be able to live a “normal” life, so why live at all? Staying alive for THIS kind of life doesn’t seem worth it."

The newest thing in discovering is that I feel physical pain in my arms/hands like a wave surging through them when I allow myself to really feel sadness vs. numbing it out. What in the world is this? "
581,I'm not sure what's wrong with me?,"Everday is starting to feel the same, I don't do the same things yet it feels exactly like yesterday. I don't have a schedule, my life is all over the place and it's alright for the most part. I do have a lot of family issues but over the years I've learnt not to care about them anymore so I know that isn't the issue. I'm not having any trouble, I think I look nice, I'm glad I have a roof over my head, I'm happy I have an education, so I can't put a finger on it, what's wrong? I have friends, I go to school, I want to get married one day and have kids, so why do I feel like this? I'm not feeling sad but rather I'm not feeling anything at all. It feels boring, like sometimes I wish I was being stalked so I could at least feel paranoid or some fear. Is this normal?"
582,teeth,"i went to the dentist today and they said i have gingivitis, im not that good at taking care of myself but now my boyfriend is talking abt how i need to take care of myself and that things arent gonna work out between us if i dont. i dont know how to explain to him that i genuinely cannot brush my teeth because of my depression. can anybody help me try to explain to him or what i can do to take care of my gingivitis"
583,I’m depressed,Honestly I feel depressed and dead I feel like everyone in my life hates me and that I’m alone. it makes me frustrated how I’m still living with my parents and I’m 19 and I’m still on a leash and being treated like a little kid their is times I just want to kill myself. Honestly I feel like no one cares cares how I feel and I feel like no girl would ever care how I feel and I just feel like I shouldn’t be alive l. And that I can’t date anyone and that I’m alone feeling depressed and anger inside me.
584,I can’t take it anymore,I have been adopted and i went through all kinds of abuse which have altered my brain.Yesterday i celebrated my 19th birthday alone and almost ended it all i am scared of myself. I wish therapy was option
585,I don’t know how to handle this anymore,"For a bit of context I (13F) live with my sister (15) , mom (40) dad (47), and grandma (69) on a farm. My dad is a narcissist and emotionally immature, my mother is emotionally absent, my grandma is a stoner and a drunk, and my sister is well a normal sister, we bicker and fight a lot like normal siblings. I do online school and go to public school for electives (yearbook and weights) Tuesday through Friday and go to a tutor on Wednesdays

Since I live on a farm ( mind you it’s pretty small, we have about 30-40 chickens, 5 ducks, 3 dogs, and a cat ) which is about 35 acres, my mom runs a farmstand and we are working on an airBNB. I am pretty busy throughout the day, chores and school occupying most of my time. I have around 10 routinely chores a day along with extra chores that I get a random times ( these extra chores can be from 1 hour to 12+ hours )

I am expected to finish all of my schoolwork and chores before I go to school for electives ( 12:45-2:40 ) and if I don’t I will get my phone and all electronics taken away.

I do most of not everything that is asked of me, have straight A’s, do my absolute best to turn in all my work on time and generally try to stay out of peoples way to avoid be a problem.

If I hear footsteps I hide whatever I’m doing (reading most of the time, watching a show, on my phone) ( even if I finished all my chores ) and pretend to be doing something more ‘productive’ ex. Cleaning my room, doing schoolwork etc.

I have free time but it can be taken away at any moment, I never know when my dad will be in one of his ‘moods’ and get mad at me. So I play it safe and keep to my room.

I barely have enough motivation to get up, all I wanna do is stay in bed, all I wanna do is nothing. I can’t do schoolwork unless I force myself to and usually I end up getting mentally and emotionally exhausted from even attempting my work. 

In my dads words ‘chores are more important than school’ I have to get up at 8:30 which is a huge struggle due to me having no free time without the fear of it being taken away in an instant, I don’t sleep until my eyelids are so heavy I cannot physically keep them open anymore (12-6am) I am also not allowed to take naps or go to friends houses/even out of the house sometimes if my school is not done.

The only comfort I have is shows and books that I have an emotional connection with, wether it be a character that had had similar experiences as me or another reason, it can be taken from me in an instant.

I try to stay out of people way, don’t ask for anything, don’t ask for help, just do it myself. I don’t wanna ask questions or ask for things I don’t need. I don’t wanna be a bother or upset anyone ( mostly my dad, he yells a lot ) so I avoid asking for things if I can do it myself.

What I said is barely even surface level of things that go on, I barely mentioned anything. I know most of you will probably think I’m being a dramatic middle school kid, but it’s more than that, way , way, more. I didn’t get into any of the details at all."
586,I cant take the fact that my father doesn’t accept my transition.,"
Me (20) and my father (54) live together in an apartment. He does not support my transition and it hurts so much. I’ve been transitioning for around 16 months now and he still refuses to use my chosen name and pronouns. Whenever we try to talk about it and I call him out, even in the slightest it always turns into a toxic shouting and bitching fest. The other day he told me he was praying the trans away at church, without even being prompted.

However, ignoring the transgender stuff my father is very supportive and kind to me. He has been like my best friend for my entire life. Hell, the other day he took me to buffalo wild wings because he saw I was sad. Recently he also took me on a road trip just to hang out, and it went great. Lately I have been going through an awful depression/anxiety/ocd episode. He has been helpful by playing Minecraft with me and watching YouTube videos with me. I feel so entitled and selfish to expect him to support my transgender identity.

I am so hurt because I genuinely don’t know what to do in this situation, my father’s toxicity to my transition is destroying me because I feel so freaking guilty for being trans and taking hormones. At the same time I can’t really cut him out of my life because he obviously loves me.

Honestly I’m such a fuck up. Last month I already told him that his (and the rest of the families) lack of support is making me want to detrans. I can’t take this, I’ve already waved the white flag. I’ve already lost. It’s over. I’ve wanted to be a woman my whole life but I need to accept I can’t have it. I’m a burden to my family 

Yes, in case any of you are wondering, yes I am feeling suicidal. I don’t want to tell him though because that seems manipulative and I don’t want to make him feel bad. I feel so greedy and selfish, some people get kicked out of the house or treated like crap by their parents. Meanwhile this is my main issue with him and it’s tearing me apart, ain’t I spoiled. "
587,My kids are the only reason I’m still here,"I have no other reason. No friends, no family outside of my daughters. Nothing brings me joy or makes me smile. I’m sick of the antidepressants and the “maybe things will get better soon.”

It never will and I don’t want to do this anymore"
588,I hate crying.,"I'm starting to believe maybe i'm the problem in most of my relationships with people. In christmas last year I cried for hours all thanks to a stupid question my cousin did, I cried after my friends forgot my birthday, I hate it. I almost cried yesterday at school with literally no reason at all.

Maybe I'm the problem,  maybe my classmates are right: I am indeed a sensitive bitch. I can't handle anything. 

I hate crying.

I hate when I suddenly feel a weight on my chest, when I can't breathe properly and then my eyes start to feel blurry when the feeling finally kicks in, I hate not being able to express my feelings correctly, I hate my school, my classmates, people my age."
589,"Depression is slowly consuming me, day by day","Over the last year I have gained 80lbs, I now weigh 337lbs. I've noticed that my breathing is much more shallow, the average person takes 2 seconds to breathe in and 3 seconds to exhale. I take 1 second inhales and 1 1/2 exhales. I was so depressed that I wouldn't even masterbate, for 2 years. I finally found a bit of spark to do so in the last few months and the difference is staggering. For one, my manhood has shrunk almost an entire inch in those 2 years, and now... instead of 9 to 11 minutes of playtime, I can only manage 1 minute or two. Which is very frustrating. I can't imagine what sex would be like... I've tried a couple different approaches but nothing works. 

My blood pressure has risen over 40% in the last year alone. There are times where my arms feel very weak for no reason, it lasts a few minutes and then goes away, but that is something I've never experienced before. It only started happening within the last month. 

I can barely carry a 10lb bag of groceries 3 blocks, which I have to rest for 10-15 minutes afterwards, heavily breathing through my mouth because my nose doesn't inhale enough air. I'm not running the 3 blocks or anything, just walking at a somewhat normal pace.

I can't walk more than 6-7 blocks before my left leg begins to burn and my left ankle begins rotating, acting like it's going to pop out of joint or something. 

A lot of the weight I've gained has gone to my face, particularly my cheeks. This makes my face look malformed and is a tremendous put off to women I try to approach. Most of the rest of my weight has been into my gut, which has grown in size 2 fold in the last year.

Something has to change or this depression is going to kill me. "
590,Tips for when I’m sinking into depression ,"Recently I’ve found myself sinking into my depression more frequently, anyone have some tips to ground myself?"
591,It hurts really fucking bad hahaha ,I’m so fucking weak useless and clueless I don’t know what I’m fucking doing anymore lmao I have no ground to stand on not even my own suffering because I feel u don’t deserve to feel it and I can’t stand the truth being seen but what am I running from what the fuck am I running from lol. I can’t swallow I can’t breath because I feel no matter what I do it’s no use I hate myself so fucking much there’s nothing I could do that won’t make me hate myself even more. Nothing that’ll take my self hatred away that won’t feel like a diversion and I’m fucking exhausted 
592,I don't have a purpose of life (ikigai),"I'm 24yo, but my life going no where. I'm pathetic coward who scared of even socialy with my neighbour. Everynight i just hope all of this end soon."
593,Post Graduation Depression,"Hi yall, first time posting. I’ve (23f) struggled with depression since I was a teenager. When I was younger, I was so excited for college still. It was all I dreamed of. Moving out, making friends, falling in love, learning. I graduated last year, and while I’m really proud of myself, I don’t know what to do now. I’ve felt depressed since graduating. I don’t know what the point of living is. I work every day and then die. I can’t get a better job, I’ve tried. And the only point of waking up feels like to get money to pay bills. I feel like I have no other milestones left. I stopped doing my hobbies, hanging out with friends makes me mad, on my days off I just rot in bed. I have friends, family, and a wonderful partner, but I feel like I’m just wasting time until I die. Anyway, hopefully one day I can afford therapy or have some sort of epiphany on how people are happy. This was melodramatic. Any advice or stories would be appreciated. Thanks yall. "
594,Lost my friend to suicide three days ago,"He was one of the few people who had an impact on my life and understood what I was going through. We both had depression. I often helped him - by talking, coming to his house, giving him list of good psychiatrists and therapists, even arranged a meeting with psychologist a month before his death. I can't forgive myself. I feel like I haven't done enough. None of us noticed the signs, he was going out with friends one day before, talking about his future, loving his new hobby...Maybe I should call an ambulance before? Drag him to the hospital? Give him any stronger meds I had at my house? Everyone is saying that it was his decision and that we should respect it, however, I can't. This shouldn't end like this. 

I am after my own suicide attempt - so I know what he was going through that night. His decision was probably impulsive. Why he decided to do this? Why he didn't call me that night? I was awake. He was only 22 years old, intelligent, good-hearted, sensitive, maybe too sensitive for this world. I simply cannot fathom what's happening. I can't. It's so unfair. "
595,Rant/vent,"I have a lot of chronic illnesses that are very disabling at times. Some of them are lifelong so it won’t get better, I can only manage them as much as possible. I have a hard time keeping a job because of this.

I really need to take a break and focus on my health but I can’t because I have bills to pay. My job offers different types of leave but I won’t get paid enough while I’m on leave to pay my bills and I can’t just keep going on leave everytime I have a flare up or something.

I feel like I’m going to get fired because of how much time I’m taking off and not being able to do my job responsibilities. 

I need a job that doesn’t drain me mentally and physically but also pays enough so I have somewhere to live and transportation to my doctors appointments.

My family won’t let me live with them for free. I would be willing to watch the kids, or do something to contribute. They don’t even believe I’m sick and just think I’m a hypochondriac.

I can’t work but I also can’t not work. So what the fuck am I supposed to do?

I’m tired of being sick and I’m tired of living so I should just kill myself."
596,No One Cares,"A few weeks ago I posted about how my depression is coming back and how I feel more sad and alone. Well that feeling has just gotten worse since then and I'm deteriorating rapidly. I've fully isolated myself from anyone and the only time I actually leave my house is for school and work. My parents have picked up on me being down a little but my friends don't seem to care or notice. All they see is me high 24/7 and they just tell me to stop and that I'm being like my ex boyfriend. Earlier today one of my ex boyfriends who still hangs out in our group said ""we might have to banish you"". And ik it's just a reference to the group's inside joke but it still hurt me for some reason. It felt serious. I just feel like no one wants me around and that I'm a big burden for everyone. All I want to do is rot in bed all day because I just feel like shit."
597,help,help. i don’t know what to do. i cant do this anymore. i’m on step 1 of my benzodiazepine taper and i literally don’t have words to explain
598,I wanna disappear without dying,"Like, I don't wanna exist on this mortal coil any longer, but at the same time I'm too chicken shit to even hurt myself much less actually end it all. Like, I just wanna go *poof* and maybe exist as like some kinda peter pan fairy tale or something but at the same time not exist so I can stop feeling this way."
599,I don't know anymore. ,"Just like the title says. I don't know anymore. I feel like a complete failure. I never do anything with myself, I have no friends, my job feels like a dead end, and everyone in my family hates me. what's the point in living if I don't have anything to look forward to anymore? I'm miserable 24/7, nothing seems to help. Even when I do feel happy it's only temporary and I'm back to square one. Things have been so bad it's gotten to where I'll just go days without eating or showering. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm so tired of feeling this bad. I don't know what else to do. I don't want to live like this anymore."
600,Took a MMSE test today.,"Hey all. Normally I’m a pretty upbeat guy. I went through something 4 years ago that I’m still struggling with and today was a part of that. I’m HIV+ and have HIV Associated Neurocognative Disorder because I had encephalitis. It fucks with my memory. Badly. So I took my second MMSE test today, supposed to have one every year but, I, of course, forgot. Heh heh. On brand. The first time I took it I got a 24, cutoff for normal cognitive function. Today I got a 22, which is Mild cognitive impairment or possible early-stage to mild dementia. So I got that goin’ on. But the kick in the nuts is constantly forgetting things and saying I don’t remember, have I told you this already. It makes me feel idiotic and kills my self esteem. Like HIV, there’s no cure for this and it’ll only get worse. The meds I’m on will slow it. I try not to think too much about it but I’m constantly reading about it cause I want to know. I’m the one who asked my infectious disease doctor if I had this. But I’m alive. I’m undetectable. I have a great support system. It’s just some days are worse than others. Thanks for reading and if you have any questions, please ask. I educate when I can with what I can. Head up and shoulders back, citizens."
601,Everything's been dull for a while now.,"The light has been getting dimmer since I was 11. Now its almost completely dark. I don't know how to go on anymore, and no  in my life really gets it. No one loves me the way I am and it hurts. The panic attacks are too much. The lonlieness is too much. The feeling sick is too much. The mean people I actually cannot get away from is too much."
602,F*ck loneliness and feel of guilty,"French 24M virgin. Never have any king of relationship with a girl. I had to watch a lot of weird porn and became addict to. I hurted a lot of people cause of that and some traumas. I try to change with medication and it's difficult but it works somehow. I try to talk with girl but i'm weird and ugly. I don't have any idea of subject and I talked at the end sex and kink. I hate myself. Why can't I talk normally with girls ? Why am I weird ? And loneliless hurts hard, very hard. Sometimes I want to disappear or not exist, but I am a coward who is afraid of pain. I have any chance in life... happiness doesn't exist for me and it's my karma"
603,Curious,"Am I bad person for questioning peoples intentions towards me 24/7, I never let down my guard unless it’s my blood family and still even then the ones I didn’t grow up with I treat like strangers and never let my guard down and lately I Been seeing them try to get along but I just can’t feel I connection to em and when they come over I just treat them like they strangers cause tbh that’s all they all but yeah my bad for rambling but does anyone relate? Or am I just a trash person I’m open to criticism "
604,Doctor made me feel worse,I went to the doctors today and I saw a different doctor due to the regular one being away and I was speaking to the guy and I told him I have been feeling really sad and depressed due to my break up and it’s my first break up and explained I have been struggling to sleep and the thing they gave me hasn’t been working and I’m losing motivation and feeling worse than before and the guy told me that I should just get a new gf or have a one night stand like wtf ye that’s so easy just get a new gf which for one takes a long time and the one night stand is just mad I don’t care for meaningless sex I want love how does any of this advice help me I want to start working but atm I’m struggling to sleep which doesn’t make it easy for me to find work or if I get a job I won’t be able to wake up for that so I’m trying to sort that before I move on to work and make some self improvements.
605,I don’t know what to do anymore,"I’m so overwhelmed with assignments, I’m a failure. -no, if someone fails, it’s implying they tried at all. I haven’t been trying, I’ve shut given up. I feel so sick everyday, I feel physically sick; I’m surviving off of caffeine and vitamin d supplements. I’m literally hanging on by barely a thread, I want to do something to myself in 49 days, after I attend a concert I really want to go to, and tell my friends about it. I just don’t see the point in life, I genuinely don’t see a future for me and I’m terrified. I know suicide is a stupid, selfish, weak decision, and it’s just the easy way out… …but, I’ve already established myself as a cowardly quitter, haven’t I? I’m so overwhelmed, I feel weak, I’m exhausted, I get chills and I’m always cold. I feel so awful, I don’t really want to die, but I really really don’t want to live like this. I just want a break, and after the break, it’s all going to start again. What’s the point? I’m sorry, I’m feeling horrible right now and I don’t know what else to do. I just want to cry into someone’s shoulder and be comforted, that would pit a sky give me a spark of hope and that’s just pathetic. I’m so desperate for attention, aren’t I? Lol, I’m a waste. Sorry mom and dad, look at the intelligent, pretty, kind, optimistic, and perfect girl you raised! Now that you’ve created this monster, you don’t want to face me, do you? You’re just like me, even if you deny it, you’re a hypocrite who’s also scared of the consequences their own actions caused.

I’m sorry, I don’t know what I want to hear right now, I’m so cold and sick…"
606,how do i believe quotes and stuff like that?,"i am struggling with motivation and many other things, so i’ve started to read and find quotes and like affirmations. when reading them, i recognize what it’s saying/i understand it and stuff like that, but i have a very hard time believing them and/or implying them into my life and daily thoughts. i just don’t know how to use all those quotes i read. i don’t know how to imply them. i don’t know how to have them truly resonate with me. idk really know how to explain it. any tips?"
607,"Self-centered, narcistic, and depression.","Is it normal for human being to looking for validation of the way he think? I may have depersonalization disorder. Sometime i feel so lonely, and i want someone attention, or empaty. Its irony because i don't  empaty myself either, but i seeking someone empaty for my condition. As if i was the most hurt in this world. That so disgusting, pathetic, self-centered, and inferior. I know that. I don't know is there any change if i talk to therapis/professional about my personality."
608,I don’t know what’s my problem,"Hi  ,English isn’t my native language so it might be hard to understand 
I don’t know how to talk to people that are close to me about this so I thought I can share here , I’m 14 girl yea I know 
 my parents divorced a few months ago, it was really hard on my two brothers (16,8) and still is but me? I didn’t felt anything not sad ,mad, upset i just don’t  know how to feel . I wouldn’t say that I was a help to my younger brother we fought everyday he said so many things to me like “go to dad house and don’t ever comeback ” or “i wish you’d die” I just laugh and make fun of him I know I’m in the wrong here but my mom always took his side and it just made me hate him more she would say things like “why are you doing this to your brother” and “ you really like to make him miserable don’t you “ and my favourite “ put yourself in his shoes “ I don’t get it if I fight with him it means that I want to make him miserable but when he fights with me it’s because he doesn’t know what’s going on and why my parents are not together . I know that it’s true but my mom acts like only my brother is going through that . About my older brother he just can’t understand why they can’t just work it out .
My parents were always fighting and they did try for it to work in the end it didn’t.

 all of  this happened in August I think that now my relationship with my mom and dad is worse me and my dad were closer than me and mom but now I don’t really talk to them also to my brothers the only reason why we don’t fight is because I’m in my room all day . 
It’s random but I can’t remember anything it started a few months ago and now it’s starting to annoy me I can’t remember to do homework, drink, put a clock for the morning and also I’m fucking lazy I don’t clean my room , when I remember to do homework I don’t , I don’t go to school cause I can’t get up in the morning because I go to sleep at 6am and when I don’t go to school I just sleep, on my phone , eat and go to sleep again at 6am it’s a fucking loop everyday
I can’t concentrate at school and because I don’t come like 3 days a week I don’t know anything. I fucking hate everything about myself how are you lazy,stupid, annoying, selfish, spoiled and a crybaby . Everytime my mom tries to talk to me I’m always mad or my dad also I can’t get angry cause if I do it feels like I’m going to cry or if I try to talk about my feelings I feel like someone is choking me and when I just want to tell something that happens to me I get everything mixed up I can’t tell a story without my friends looking at me like I said something crazy 

I can’t think about anything because if I think like “I can’t do this anymore “ my fucking mind is telling me that I only think that because I think someone is listening to me
I actually don’t know if this is real it feels like this is all fake and someone is controlling me or that my life is just an experiment 
I just don’t understand why me I prefer that my life were just sad then to not know what I feel 
I can be sad for a day but all of a sudden nothing happen and im all happy again or that im trying to be feel something I don’t care what but I just sit there and think about nothing 
I really just want to know what’s happening and why am I like this I wish that I could remember what it was like before but I just can’t. 

Well that was sure something do I feel good after writing all of this? I don’t know
Good night now 
And it’s 7am
 nah I’m not going to school

610,Life,"I'm just kinda feeling like I need to ramble somewhere and I'm not sure if this will get taken down or what. All my friends have heard it countless times before and I can't really keep belly aching to them or my significant other or I feel like they will just up and leave me for someone who isn't such a sad sack of shit. I have a good life but I consistently feel like a horrid miserable pile of whatever. It gets good for an hour or hell even a day then it swings back showing me I had no place being so content in life. I have a job that consumes my life, and an apartment that consumes my money, I have another part of my life that does nothing but increase my stress. I drink daily and wish I had the balls to just get lost. Nothing makes me feel happy anymore except seeing my long distance partner. I know I shouldn't prioritize the relationship above all else but when that's the only good thing it's hard not too. I have a therapist but therapy has never worked for me I'm on meds that don't work. Life is just wonderful and Ive come to find out it's not life. I can blame my job, my drinking, my whatever on how bad I feel but you know what for once in my life I feel like the depression is right. This is 1000% on me. Maybe I'm just not cut out to live in the world and be happy at the same time. I have therapy tomorrow and I really don't know what to say anymore maybe we will talk about my parents, or job, or the drinking, or maybe I'm just sad cause my ADHD is bad. I'm tired of guessing wondering and trying to get better. Maybe this is just me forever. 

TLDR: just sad rambling "

612,"16, hate myself, wanna commit suicide","I’m 16 turning 17 in two months but tbh I don’t even think I’m gonna make it. I fucking hate myself, I’m a worthless piece of shit and I wish reincarnation was real so I could kill myself and be reborn as a different person. Every day is the same dreadful cycle, I feel like an empty soulless shell of a human-being doing the same shit every day. It also sucks that everyone my age is thriving, having jobs, getting into relationships, getting d1 scholarships, etc. and I’m just stuck in my room with a masturbation addiction wishing my life was different but not doing anything because i feel like when i do try to do something about it I just fall back into this endless rut. I haven’t talked to anyone about it because I don’t wanna be a burden to others, and I’m kinda scared of death but at the same time I don’t wanna live this shitty life anymore. I’m gonna wrap this up by saying I have nothing going for me in life, I’m ugly as shit, no marketable skills, no social life (social anxiety), and honestly idk how much longer I can do this. Ppl say it gets better, and I want to experience life, but I feel like I’m not gonna get to feel those experiences anyway so what’s the point. Ppl r prob gonna ignore this post like always, but I just really needed to vent so if u read this far I really appreciate it.

  
UPDATE: Idk who’ll see this but first off I just wanted to say, wow, I never expected this post to get any attention tbh. But thank you to everyone who responded I wish I could I hug y’all fr, and anyone who also said they r also going through shit I really hope things get better for you 🫂. As for me ik it’s only been 2 days but I’m alr starting to feel a little better. I stepped out of my comfort zone and tried out for my hs baseball team, and I actually made it! And I still find it hard to open up to ppl but I finally did to a friend and I feel a little better. I‘ll be honest, I still don’t like myself and I feel behind in life, but I’m gonna take this one step at a time. Again, thank you all for the love & support 🙏❤️"
613,why do people leave me when i’m at my lowest?,"i’ve dealt with a lot of problems in my life. from loved ones passing away to being put in a life or death situation from a family member. because of that, i have some mental health issues (depression, anxiety, ptsd, and recently diagnosed bpd). i had the knowledge that mental health issues are not easy to live with, but i didn’t know how hard until i started to see people push away.

my friends know of what i go through, but they don’t know how intense it is because if i tell them, i know they won’t stick around because i’m dealing with a friend who’s doing it now. my friends say they’ll always be my friends, but i know if i disappear, they won’t care (i’ve tested it and it’s true). watching it in real time and knowing that at the end of the day, it’s my fault sucks.

how can i make people stay? or like me? or even tolerate me when i’m like this. i don’t want to live a life of loneliness but i know that it won’t get better because of everything going on. i feel hopeless and life seems worthless and monotonous at this point.

616,identity crisis?,"hey look this one’s probably going to be a bit strange, lately i’ve been starting to feel like i’m not me, i feel almost like my decisions are entirely based off what other people think, but at the same time im so deep in my own head i don’t know if i even think that

i grew up fairly “normal” around 12-13 my parents started arguing constantly and eventually divorced around when i was 16

during that period i started to rebel and try drugs and new experiences i fell into a deep depression for around 2-3 years within that same time i had my first sort of relationship also, that relationship had a very messy ending and since then it felt almost like i had pulled myself out of the depressive state, i started working out and exercising, no drugs or alcohol nothing.

i tried another relationship a-bit later and it’s probably not in the best state at the moment, and i feel my anxiety’s and depression coming on again, i now smoke/vape constantly, lost my job and have no motivation to work, pull myself out of bed or exercise, most mornings i wake up i wish i didn’t open my eyes, i feel the strongest feeling of regret and numbness the second my brain knows I’m conscientious,

i feel like I’m starting to question who i am, i feel like decisions i make are highly dependent on what other people think of me

i feel incredibly lost, i don’t know who i am, what i want, what my goals are

since around 12-13 i never saw my life past 20

I’m so deep in my own head i continuously ask my self if I’m bad socially, if I’m controlling, if I’m a narcissist this list goes on

i just feel like I’m not me but i cant explain or understand it, it sounds silly because i am me

617,Suffering for love,"A friend of mine is suffering because of love, I dont like to see him like that but I cant help him since in love matters im the same.

618,Why? ,"Why is it no matter how hard I try I can't get anything right? Why is it that I try so hard in everything that people look at me with hate and pity? I try so hard and yet I feel like I'm sprinting in the opposite direction. I don't want to burden anyone with my problems, but the problems keep piling up and I don't know what to do. Why can't I solve them already? It's been years? Nobody likes me much, and the ones I do have I try so hard for and yet get nothing back in return. Why is it that when I try so goddammit freaking hard for people and get nothing in return?

To put it bluntly... 

... WHY AM I SO USELESS?? "
619,I wish I didn’t have people that care about me. I need to be pushed over the edge ,"I was rejected once again. I will spare the details because they don’t matter, but fact is I will not be living what I always wanted to live. Life feels like a prison and I can’t escape. I have so many people that depend on me emotionally. My parents, my uncle and aunt, my grandmother… I just can’t destroy their lives because of my self hate and low will to live. I’m trapped in this nightmare. Maybe if I was more lonely I could end it all. I’ll keep suffering it all until everyone I care dies so I can go too"
620,Is this depression or something else?,"Im so tired pretending that im fine when all my body wants to do is break down and cry and cry until i cant shed any more tear. People see me happy when im with them but times when im all alone just makes me feel so empty and sad and lonely that i want to just end my life. I cant tell my sister because she’s in med school and i don’t t want to worry her about me, i can’t tell my brother because im not comfortable opening up go him. I especially cannot tell my parents because i think they would not understand why i am like this when they have provided me everything i need and most of what i want. I have a boyfriend but im not sure how he would react if i tell him about this. I tried many times to open up to him but i cant seem to open my mouth and speak about this. I have a good number of close friends who i can talk about this but opening up about this is hard for me. It’s not something i can easily speak about and i think if i do im oversharing and also because i know they have problems of their own

622,My life has not been the same since I left home for college: depression and loneliness,"I was famous in my home country, received many awards for science and mathematics, and represented the country in the math Olympics internationally (IMO), it was a dream to study abroad, I got the royal scholarship, came to the States, and BOOM: my life has not been the same since I left home for college. 

Oh. My. God. I just do not know how to start and where to start from. It has been numerous days when I did not want, or couldn't, leave my bed. Everything turned dark, gradually, and I observed myself sinking and sinking. While doing so, I was TOO embarrassed to ask for help because of how high everyone who knows me thinks of me. 

I started missing deadlines, failing classes because I would not show up to midterms or finals or do anything, procrastinating, sleeping too much or sleeping too little, and spending too much time in my head thinking thinking thinking about EVERY little thing and every single thing. 

I hate the way I look yet many people say I am handsome and pretty. I hate the way I am different yet everyone I meet has admired something about me. But, there is this feeling in me that is just telling me: Oh you are not good enough. You are nothing. 

I hate this voice. I hate its echo that resonates with various frequencies periodically in my thoughts. I made mistakes yes, but how can I fathom all of this that has happened to me: 

A. My beloved brother experienced mental illness during my first year of college, it had gotten to the point where he was going to kill me in two instances, one while he was driving, and the other by a knife. We grew up together, we were together in every single thing that we did.. 

B. I got into a toxic relationship, where the guy was cheating on me for years, yet I was so into him because I was too appreciative and grateful for finally being able to practice my true sexual orientation (homosexuality is prohibited in my country)

C. With A and B going on and on and on: I decided to claim asylum in the States (due to sexual orientation), and I think I made the biggest mistake of my life. I am a family guy. I grew up around and being surrounded by them. My family has been my biggest support system, and the only one. I have not seen them in 3 years and a half. But what can I do? I wanted to be free. 

Loneliness. Loneliness. Loneliness. 

I have had big dreams, and I am slowly chasing them, but man! this is well above what I can take. I feel like I have hit rock bottom and I am unable to get back up. The depression is eating me away. I just always feel like I am in my head with my thoughts, always feel like life is dark and nothing matters anymore. 

I just needed to get this off my chest. Thank you for reading. Thank you. "

624,It's just too much + finding help in Denmark?,"Hello everyone, I just wanted to vent, and maybe find any advice... TLDR at the  bottom

My mental health is just getting worse and worse recently and I feel like I am out of options... 

I moved to Denmark nearly 6 years ago, hoping to start new life, but things just keep getting worse. The official reason for my moving were my studies, but I had so many more reasons to escape from my home country, Poland. Of course my studies went horribly wrong. I had to redo a semester because of my depression, and afterwards I couldnt find any job related to my studies. I was left with massive student debt - the way it works in Denmark is that you get grant if you are studying but you also have to work 42 hours a month. And since I was studying during covid, all the student work places - bars, cafes, hotels, etc. were shut down immediately. I got a letter from the goverment saying i have to pay back pretty much all the student grant I got. I asked them where the hell was I supposed to work if everything was closed, they didnt care. And there was no way for me to set the amount I was paying back each month, and it ended up being nearly 1/3 of my salary. Every month. For 2 years. I was barely survivng, not going to any concerts, selling some of my instruments, dumpster diving to find food, and I am stuck living in place that's cheap, but super filthy. 

My studies lead me nowhere, since last year they shut down pretty much all study programms in English, and my degree in worth only half of a bachelor, so I cannot even do masters with it, and my Danish isnt nowhere near good enough to study in it.  

I still have no idea what I want to do in the future. I am 28 by the way. My life in Poland was really bad as well, I had to collect scrap metal and do black work to save up enough money to move out, since it was hard to find ""real"" job in my hometown. My parents are quite poor themselves, and I would feel like shit if I had to ask them for money. 

This winter was particularly awful for me... in the summer I have quite a steady job, but outside of that I work at the trash sorting place that doesnt have a steady schedule and is super unstable. I had some shifts last fall, but since December there was no work. I managed to get on unemployment benefits, but because of that, and my depression, I ended up being stuck at home pretty much all January and February. Didnt feel the need to go out anywhere. My sleeping schedule became super irregular, sometimes sleeping all day, sometimes not being able to sleep for days. 

My gym was the only thing keeping me sane, but of course I fucked up as well... I was bulking heavy since October, but making zero strength gains, so I decided to order steroids, and I just got a letter from the police saying that they got my package. They will tell me what my punishment is in 2 weeks, and I am so scared that I will end up in jail, since I heard that Denmark is super strict about steroid use. 

As for my summer job, its really, really bad as well... I work at the outside street food market (if you are Danish, you probably know the place), and this Friday we are having our first pre-opening meeting. I hate that place because of the double standards (they dont really care if you are good at your job, only if you are good at sucking up to the managers and if you befriend the managers you can get away with everything, last year there was a guy literally giving me death threats and he wasnt even fired, just asked to apologize to me) and the fake positivity (you have to smile and be happy all the time, i was threatned to be fired just for mentioning my depression). I was hoping to get promoted to a shift leader, so I could finally earn some respect, since I worked there for years, but I got ignored. 

I felt like music can be an escape for me, I am really into goth and industrial music, I am trying to attend to concerts if I can, and I was trying to make music like that myself. But ever since I moved here, I have absolutely zero motivation. I got couple synths and bass guitar all connected and ready to be played, but I just... never feel like actually working on it. Which in turn makes me feel even worse, even more depressed, even more likely to work on it, and so on. I have couple friends who are working on all kinds of music, and sometimes I just feel like I should just give away all my instruments to them since I will never use them. 

Finding mental health professionals is impossible here. I tried twice. I had to go through my GP, and the first time I spoke to her, she completely ignored me, with stuff like ""my teenage daughter is going through the same"" , ""just go and workout"", and so on. When she finally did let me see a psychiatrist, she didnt take me seriously either. I was waiting 4 months to see her, and I vented to her about everything, only for her to tell me that ""there is nothing wrong with me"". I tried again the year after, same story. 5 months waiting time, he says I am fine. And because of my student debt, and soon the inevitable steroid fine, I am way too broke to afford a therapist. 

TLDR: I know I am not fine. And I feel like I am out of options. Having no plans for the future, stuck between summer job where that fake positivity just makes me angry and depresssed, and winter with barely any work, stuck at home with instruments I am too depressed to use, and now possibly going to jail or being stuck with a massive fine. My only moments of... happiness? being goth shows, which end up fueling my depression and self-hatred, since I know I will never be able to make music myself. 

&#x200B;

If you took your time to read it all, thank You. And if there is anyone living in Copenhagen, who wants to hang out, you can contact me. I am up for anything, going for a walk, listening to music, watching some movies, anything to break to cycle of home-gym-shitty work. "
625,The nostalgia makes me super depressed,"I often think about my earlier years as a kid, and I miss it so bad. Back then I used to have many friends, I knew everyone and they knew me. I left during middle school, which I regret, due to all the friends I left behind. I still have some of they’re numbers, so we talk from time to time, but haven’t seen each other in years, I’m worried my friends no longer care about me, I’ve known them since kindergarten, plus since I haven’t seen them in years, I don’t know how to stay in contact.

I feel terrible, I lack friends these days, and it hurts badly. I miss my childhood, which I will never get back, I’m worried I’ll lose contact of my old friends forever and I’ll be forgotten.

I have so many stresses in life, but this makes me so sad, I waste my days playing video games or watching YouTube, I miss everyone, everything about that era."
626,Im a failure,"Dont even get me started, I cant socialize, im still a virgin, I havent even had my first kiss and im already 18 years old, my only friend tells me that I have to look for people because thats a mans job, but im tired of that bs, im not a man, not even worthy of being called a human being, I would love a woman who reaches out to me, but of course thats not gonna happen, because why would the princess ever leave the castle if her knight is coming right? I just, cant do this anymore, I really cant"
627,i think ive made my final decision.,"i love music, i love nature. i love love. im ready to go, im dreaming of the other side and i hope it’s nice. i hope everything goes according to plan. i bought my mom a birthday cake for tomorrow and saw my girlfriend. i told all my friends that i loved them. i broke up with her and she didn’t even try to fight it, i know she can tell something is really wrong and she let me cry in her arms. but mostly she just says stop crying. i wish i had the motivation to keep going, but i just let myself down every time. i got the pills and liquor and the train ticket. i just wanna go see the beach one more time. part of me is scared and honestly everytime i think about my mom i start crying, but i can’t do this. i really hope she will understand. i have a note and by this time tomorrow i’ll be in a different state. im so excited to see the beach for the last time, then go. im not regular. i barely make friends, im terrible at relationships, i can’t keep a job, im just tired. tired of being unhappy, tired of being a burden. i wish i knew what was on the other side. by the end of tomorrow i’ll finally go.. if there is a heaven please God and Jesuss forgive me and let me go someplace nice. i am so tired.
"
628,I feel like I'm just waiting to die,"I feel no joy in doing anything. I may have these random spurts of wanting to do something but when I get to doing it I quickly lose interest and stop. Like video games or reading or working out. I just don't feel like I have the motivation to keep going, and I gave up looking for reasons why.

I feel hopeless at times despite my best efforts to be optimistic. It sometimes feels disingenuous to say that I have depression. Life has not been very fair to me for the past couple of years. While I'm grateful for what I do have, I'm left feeling wanting. I want to love someone, I want to experience freedom when travelling, I want to be able to do things most people my age are doing. But circumstances prevent it so.

I feel like I live every day trying to find a way to pass the time, waiting to inevitably die. I wish I could ""seize the day"" but I often feel that there's no point. The things I look forward to, do not excite me anymore and it makes me sad. I feel numb at times. I don't think I'm suicidal but I don't think I'm afraid of dying anymore."
629,I hate myself,"I noticed some acne on my face over the fall and decided to go on accutane. The medicine ruined my face and I’m on month 5 and it’s still awful. I now look subhuman and ugly. I regret the decision and miss how I used to look. I’ve felt like dying the whole time and I wonder how my life got to this point. I hope everyone out there is happier than me, no one deserves my pain. "
630,Just a curse to everyone it seems.,"Not that everyday isn’t hard for me but today I really got an unlucky roll. I had an argument with my partner early in the day and about 30 mins ago, I was informed by my “family” of why I am just a curse. I have special circumstances and due to those circumstances, I can’t do certain things and this affects everyone around me as well. The argument with my partner was my fault because I added more stress than I should’ve. It just seems like I curse anyone close to me and I hate it. If this is all I can do for people around me, what good am I truly? Anyway, this isn’t anyone’s problem but if you did read this then thanks. "
631,"I don’t want to accept love, I hate myself but I don’t understand why","I’m a young adult and just had a heated argument with my father about college. He has always been hard on me and I sometimes struggle to meet his high standards. I don’t drink or do drugs, I don’t get into trouble with the law. But nothing ever seems to be enough with him. I don’t have the required course to enroll into the program he wants me to take in college and when I told him that their is a way for me to get into that course by taking a online summer course and apply next year he yelled at me saying things like “taking a year off is for losers” and “when I was your age I already had a full time job” (which is 18 btw). Instead of being happy that I found a way into the course he just yelled at me for what I should have done in the past to get in, Things I can’t change.


After the fight he told me he loves me and I broke down into tears for the first time since I was like 10. I feel like a failure even though I know I’m not. If anyone has ever had similar feelings please feel free to share. "
632,Winter time has me feeling worse than ever ;-;,"I (17F) have been clinically diagnosed with depression last year after deciding to get therapy but have been depressed for the past 4 years. Usually around winter time, I get even worse and lay in bed all day. This is a major problem and is seriously starting to impact my life. I used to be really active in school by playing sports and attending multiple clubs. I had dreams, goals, and ambition. But now I don't want to do anything at all. 

My daily schedule involves me waking up feeling miserable, getting dressed (only if I want to go to school), going to school, and coming back home only to lay in my bed and rot for the rest of the day. Most of the time the only reason that I actually decide to get up is because my family is pushing me. But I'm afraid that I will completely give up on myself if someone else doesn't force me. Honestly, I have no idea how to change this habit since I have been doing this for YEARS. And before anyone tells me to ""just get up and do something"" I have been trying to do that but I always just revert back to my old toxic habits. 

I have spoken to my therapist about this before and she told me to find something that makes me happy and excited and try to occupy myself with that. But the problem is, the only thing that I really enjoy now is being on my phone and things that I used to enjoy like walking, running, drawing, etc. quickly become boring for me and I just fall right back into the cycle. 

I don't know what I need to do but I know I have to change. I cannot keep feeling absolutely miserable every single day. Has anyone overcome feeling this way and does anyone have any tips?"
633,I think i hate myself ,"I have severe depression, Adhd, Autism, social and general anxiety. I’m tired. In highschool i had friends who i could feel human with, and feel good, but they’re all gone, my best friend is busy with school and i genuinely feel useless and like i’m not supposed to be here. My attention span is nonexistent. I feel overwhelmed and tired, home sick but i’m not even that far from home. 2 years of this college and no friends, I’m miserable and I’m pretty sure my depression is making me stagnant, I can’t do anything i plan these beautiful elaborate things and can’t get through them, i give up as soon as anything gets hard. I feel like i wanna die. But i’m not suicidal i’m afraid of death. I feel like shit, i feel like my feelings are invalid because there are people who are worse off. I’m tired. I’m really tired, i want to go back to highschool because i felt normal, now i feel irregular, i see people in the library studying and every time i try i get overwhelmed and anxious. Feel like I’m drowning, i’ve done nothing at all. 

I don’t understand what i feel my brain is always wiring and i really just want it to stop, i want to be normal. I wanna sleep for the next year

634,How to survive in an emotionally abusive household when you can't leave?,"I (22f) was diagnosed with C-PTSD after initially being misdiagnosed with BPD 8 months ago. I've been going to therapy regularly, but it's hard living with people who don't understand what you're going through. 

I break down crying often due to college stress ( I'm a med student in my final yr) and family issues (alcoholic dad with lots of debts). My introverted nature and lack of energy makes it hard to maintain friendships. Even crying seems impossible without being labelled ""crazy"" by my mom. 

I can't move out because I don't have any means of supporting myself and moving out is not an option in Indian household. I've been contemplating restarting antidepressants but a close relative advises against them. 

I'm stuck at home for another 1-2 years and I don't know how I can stay sane.

If anyone can relate or has coping mechanisms to share, I'd be really grateful. Thanks for reading and apologies for any mistakes :) "
635,Today was it,"I’m going crazy. I’ve been going down little by little over these last years. Trying to make deals with god as if it would help me with a cop out. Sometimes I feel it’s going to work out and before it even seems like it will, 10000 other problems come and split open in front of me.  
I’ve been dealing with severe depression and anxiety for the better part of 15 years. I haven’t had a peaceful night of sleep since I was 13 years old. All I’ve ever wanted was someone to love me (genuinely not necessarily a romantic connection. any connection). For someone to understand me. For me to go to sleep peacefully and wake up peacefully. With this fantasy, I tricked myself into moving forward even when I didn’t want to all my life.  
But today, Today is the day I feel I lost it. My will. My hope. The one strand of hope that helped me push and push and push through what I thought were the darkest days of my life. The lying voice that told me that my horrible time was behind me. It failed to tell me the truth that, with every time I find the light in the darkness, it’s extinguished a little from inside me. I don’t know if I even remember all of those times. I just remember I’ve completely repressed the hell out of it. I used to lie to myself and say that even though I don’t remember the details, I remember what I felt. That’s not true. Had I remembered, I would have the courage to persevere further. I would have known that I am capable of handling this. Of any shit that comes my way. But let alone the slightest iota of self confidence, I am nose deep in self-loathing.  
I hate myself. I truly wholeheartedly hate myself. This is the most sincere feeling I’ve ever felt. I can confirm this because in 27 years of my life, I’ve barely felt anything other than guilt and shame that I was told I should feel.  
I don’t have the courage to die. But I feel like I’ve lost my will to live. I’m not sure what to do next.  
Please don’t leave comments that are positive that say “I’m here for you” “try to hang out with friends” “change your environment” as reading them now may only enrage me further. severe depression isn’t something that you can do all of the above with. And I don’t have any friends. I have spent months not talking to another human being."
636,Reassurance needed,"I feel like my mental health is the worst mental health ever. Anyone I talk to about it never has experienced anything quite as bad and it worries me how badly I'm affected because I desperately want to recover. Since I was 21 l've had huge panic attacks which can last days and take me like two weeks to get over. I have to get extreme support and love and presence from my parents and sister to get through it. It seems to happen every few months sometimes there's a trigger sometimes there isn't. I'm currently in a bad blip and the anxiety is just intolerable the big shoots of anxiety through my chest and tummy feel so so frightening and scary. For some reason this time I'm extremely down too I am 30 now btw. I've had to go off sick at work again I only just went off sick in January. I'm absolutely at the end of my tether it's like there's a huge wall in front of me and I can't get past it. Like there's no hope. I believe l'm autistic but not diagnosed. Always been called weird odd strange etc. I still live at home, I'm overly attached to my mom and dad, I can't seem to hold down a job, I have no partner because I don't seem to get attractions. Life just seems... impossible... I am starting to see a pychologist soon and my gp regularly sees me and knows. I'm really hoping they can help. I'm on Prozac. Just feel like I have no life and am completely stuffed. :/ I can't even go on holidays since 21 as I get panic attacks when I go awar it seems unfamiliar. What kind of life is this. Any tips? Hope?

639,Telling me I'm loved means nothing.,"I deserve nothing. 

Since my first breath I have earned nothing. Not the reward of a good life nor the misery that I hold now is owed to me. 

""You have people who love you, and want the best for you."" That doesn't make everything change. That's like saying ""we're sending our thoughts and prayers to the children of a school shooting."" 

It's just pretty words. An endless cochophany of beautiful noise. Like an outstretched cry to make themselves feel better but it does nothing for me.

As I wait here for a release or a sign of escape, I'll continue to decorate my cage. Using effigies and knickknacks to line my tomb like the pharaohs before my time. 

I endure a continue to exist."

641,feel worthless,"Graduated from college 2 months ago, yet I had no time to celebrate got forced out of my dorm before saying goodbye to friends I had made over the years. Came back home, to a city that I knew no one, no friends to hang out with or do anything, no connections, nothing basically starting a new life.  Everyday im reminded how disappointing my life is, family members are constantly bringing up whether I found a job or have anything yet, old friends poking fun at me for being essentially a bum, , job search is a total mess, been laughed at by hiring managers for my stutter also how much of a joke my resume is.  Have legit zero drive or motivation to do much of anything, whenever I try something new I lose interest 20 minutes later.  Sleep Schedule is a joke, lucky if I get 3-4 hours of sleep a day, life is legit a mess, no social life, no drive, no motivation.  Prolly need some sort of meds or something but again family would look down upon that, idk just needed to rant about how shit my life is. "
642,I want someone ,I’m 39 F. I squandered my one last chance at matrimony listening to a friend who made me let go a guy I was really interested in. The guy blocked me and is now married. Now I find myself moving far away from my hometown and all I want is to marry someone from my own hometown but can’t cos I’m moving away. Today I packed my stuff and realised I’m utterly alone.  
643,Just kinda wishing for something to go my way for once,"Maybe it's my outlook to life, but I've almost always had the thought of ""something nice has happened, therefore something bad will happen next"" and for last year things seemed good, I was working super hard for my degree and I got a top grade! I was so proud of myself! 

And now I look for jobs, and all I see is ""They don't care about your grade"" ""employers look at your quality of work not your academics"" and I just.. Ow. I thought life had been a little too kind to me but I wanted to believe maybe I was just a more positive person - a couple friends even complimented how uplifting I was 

But no. I have to felt this low in a few years, it might be a new low actually. I've lost a whole friend group, I think my dad might be abusive without even realising it, I spent a lot of my savings to try and improve my job prospects and it didn't work, and now for the first time in my life my friends are inviting me to big grand things in life and I have to say no because I can't afford to go.. 

The worst part is I know 90% of this worry and sadness will go away if I get a job. But.. six months and still waiting "
644,Enneagram Test,"Just food for thought. I found it very helpful in discovering myself and why I respond to certain things a certain way. I urge anyone feeling a little unsure of themselves to do an enneagram test. It can be very revealing to our own internal needs and you will start to notice a lot about patterns you didn't realize you had. For a deeper dive, look into  'enneagram levels' after you know your number. For me, it was a big turning point. Cant recommend enough, really.  It's like reading the  manual to your operating system's archetype.  It''s kind of a longer personality test, but worth the time to take."
645,Cutting myself,"Please someone help me. I know my mental health has been terrible these past few months but recently I feel like giving myself little cuts all over my body. I hid all the sharp objects in my room, now I’m scratching myself hard enough to cut. I don’t want to end it all but I’m not fine, I’m not doing okay. "
646,"On top of all the other accidental shootings, I was playing with a .22 deringer and my dad's second or third wife was victimized","One wedding was probably just in order to have a party at this really cool church and outdoor seating areas, that's a whole other ball of fur in itself, but as for the .22,,,I remember it being hard to pull the trigger, but it was the second shot that was hard and not the first shot, it was a 2 barrel deringer that fit in my hand when I was 7, 8?  Then I grew up, and, well, I was holding my up stepmom and her sis, I may have sed drop your drawers, I was tormented so much I made jokes often to cheer myself up, but, not funny at all, I didn't expect the gun to fire, she lived of course but I don't know all the details of the medical findings, I was looking for a home as I was tossed out @18 no money or job, or car I went to college on a bicycle until  heavy rain in/near 1997-98 omfg it rained everyday almost from fall to the next early spring,,,, almost summer, but quite noticably, not nearly like it was B4, I felt like I wasn't sleeping until I was tired enough the rain was so loud,,,day and night after night"
647,I feel like giving up,"Does anyone get those days where you just want to give up on everything you have and know ? As horrible as it sounds I get these thoughts of leaving everyone and never talking to them again and go somewhere really far and just isolate myself, no friends no relationships no family and drive off a cliff. I think of hurting everyone around me before leaving. 
I hate my mind and I hate others 
I feel as if my hate has only grown more and more each day. 
I get irritated by everything and even the sounds of peoples voices. 
I wish it didn’t bother me but it does and I don’t know what else to do. 
I feel lost and I have lost all motivation yet I feel so down. 
I want to be alone but I know I shouldn’t. I just want to give up… my home my car my comfort the places I know the roads I take I want it all gone i don’t want to know about it nor anything. 
I’m tired of feeling so let down I’m tired of feeling like a complete burden I’m tired of being so controlled I’m tired of being expected to do anything I want to be on my own I want true peace. 
I’m tired of myself."
648,How do you get by with bpd,"I’m struggling really bad with my mental illness. It used to be easy but I went through a very bad traumatic experience about a year ago and man it’s like I’m wasting my life away. It’s hard to get out of bed or go to sleep. One thing I hate the most about this illness is why can’t I just be one emotion like why do I have to feel everything. I’m always up and down with my emotions and it’s getting so bad it’s noticeable now… I actually feel ugly cause my depression is showing up.. even with makeup… 

Idk if I want support or advice I just want to know if someone who has the same mental illness if they made it out and doing okay… I don’t wanna feel like I’m hopeless in this world. "
649,Uggh… I vented now I feel like sh!!t,"I vented. To my brother, who is a farmer. I’m moving into my mother’s house, the main house on the farm. I’m collapse aware, climate scared, depressed from a traumatic, abusive marriage (15+ years in the rear mirror but still rears its ugly head)… just faaaaaaaaaaack. 
We disagree about climate change, stupid convoy in Ottawa, and now I feel like the biggest idiot for bringing my inner angst on him (although still feeling 95% correct). No regrets on my facts but guilty for bringing it to my lil bro. Who is an alcoholic. Like my dad. Faaaaaaaaaack. I want to protect him still from the ugly ugly world. We aren’t babies. I’m 52, he’s 50. My mother suffers from dementia and is in LTC. What’s the point, really? So much “poor me, poor me” I’m sorry. I’m not suicidal, I have two boys otherwise who knows, and I know others have it worse, I see you… but faaaaack me. What is the fucking point of existence…
Despite all my pain, still just a rat in a cage"
650,All my friends are in heaven.,As a 32 year old woman who used to be constantly surrounded by friends I’m finding it very strange and sad that I’m finding myself alone now. My close friends all passed away and now everyone views me as the last one standing out of that group. I know I’m rambling but what I mean to say is that it’s really hard to find people I connect with at this age and adult friendships are just so tricky. How does someone my age find friends? 
651,I just want friends.,"Yeah I just want friends, I miss when I was 16 and had a group of friends, now I'm just completely alone, noone to talk to."
652,Sharing my opinion and 'problems',"(Spoiler alert: long boring story)

To start off, I am not really posting this for advice (always welcome of course) but I am curious to see if anyone can relate and I mostly just want to get this off my chest. Since I am not comfortable talking about this with my parents, and I dont want to be labeled by a doctor, knowing everyone will find out. So I chose internet strangers to talk share/talk with about my problems as a way of relief.

I am a 20 yr old male who has been feeling down for quite some time by now. And to cut to the chase, it has mostly to do with my physical appearance. Ever Since I was a little kid I have been aware of how I look (not great xD) and trying to hide it by being funny and 'confident' when I am really not. I have been coping for a long ass time, and for the past 3/4 years my feelings have been caching up. Untill this point where I am sharing my feelings, which I find to be very uncomfortable. 

I have friends who would tell me stuff like: ""its ok... idc about how you look"", or "" I could go outside and pick 20 guys uglier than you in a second"". I know they mean well, but I am not a fool xD, i know what this means. Combine that with the fact that I have never even hugged a girl, the fact I dont have a single female friend and that they have never taken an interest in me tells you and me enough... I am also not a creepy dude or anything, I have a lot of friends and I get along with almost everyone, but I am merely the funny guy.

When I think about the future, I dont nessecerely (not english srry) want to be rich, have kids, or a wife, I think I just want to be happy. My personal hygiëne is ass, cause i only brush my teeth and shower when I have to go somewehere. I either eat a shit ton of junk, or I only eat once a day. I dont get anything done and my room has 3 garbage bags that have been staring at me for over half a year. These 'symptons' have led me to believe I may have been feeling a little depressed. 

Also my whole life my parents and teacher assumed that I may have autism and ADHD or ADD or whatever, but getting a label like that will only make things worse for me I feel like. 

Is anyone else here fairly ugly? So yes, is it still bothering you? I am kind of at the edge of seeking medical help, but if I can cope a little longer... I dont have to go xD.

I want to thank you in advance if you have even read all this, means a lot to me."
653,Hypersomnia,"I’ve been struggling with this for about a decade. I was diagnosed after a sleep study found mild apnea but an MSLT said I can sleep at will.

Has anyone been diagnosed with this ? I’ve lately been questioning if my profound sleepiness/tiredness is really just mdd. I lack suicidal ideations although in the past I may have had them. I also have ED (not totally relieved by meds) and anhedonia? Pretty bad.

If anyone else has been down this route any info/suggestions would be helpful."
654,going too far ,"i’m not sure if this is even depression anymore, or something else, but i have dealt with depression since i was young, i had my first suicidal thought at 9 years old. before i even knew what that meant. my whole life ive spent feeling consistently sad, all of the time, nothing else. i’m 20 now, and the past couple months have gotten worse. i don’t feel anything anymore. i don’t feel happiness, excitement, sadness, guilt, pleasure, empathy. i don’t love or even like anyone. all i feel is contempt and annoyance. i dread seeing my “friends”, i dread talking to people, even hobbies i once found pleasure in have become more of an annoyance.

i don’t care about anyone or anything they might go through or say, my entire time spent awake is pretending to care what people say and carefully choosing my responses. i keep people around me as they will be useful in my future, but i would much prefer to spend my life completely alone. 

i have found myself thinking bad thoughts about people, strangers and loved ones, which i never would have thought of months ago. intrusive thoughts, that i just can’t seem to shake. i find myself wanting to hurt my “friends” and family, emotionally, and i do not know why. 

i feel like a shell of a person, just someone who other people can project onto and create a version of me they would prefer, and i cater to it. because i am not a person, so i change who i am around different people. i be who they want me to be and it serves me. 

i’ve lost dozens of friends in my life, i grow close to them and cut them off suddenly with no warning. i do this everytime. in the past month ive cut off one of my closest friends and i do not feel anything. they are quite upset and ruined by this but i just do not care. "
655,I suffer so much in my head that I have made life difficult for myself ,I m struggling alone mentally. I need help but I don't have the money to go to a therapist. I cannot go to my friends as my equation with them has changed and my parents expect me to be the breadwiner of the house. There is this unresolved trauma in my head and I don't know how to deal with it. I can't runaway. I m still suffering but nobody understands. What do I do? Should I smoke weed everyday?
656,Help ,I had a breakdown in November because j didn’t want to go back to my job and was avoiding it because I had anxiety and I had family here and everyone was supportive of me and told me just to quit and I finally did on bad terms with one week and I don’t even think I have mental health problems. I think I’m just so fed up that I talked to so many people about it and let my people person personality take over and I didn’t want to screw up at work and I didn’t want to screw up at home so I did nothing and then I did quit Monday (after not quitting then rescinding 2 times) and I asked my fiancé stand in the room while I did it virtually but I really just did it for him because he said I needed to quit the job but the job isn’t the root of this and now I’m avoiding work and haven’t wrapped up or told the team because I didn’t want to leave. I really know the root of all this was avoidance and now I’m on Zoloft and was taking Ativan and it’s so hard to tell what’s the issue or drug side effects. help can you tell me what you think? 
657,How do you get a depression diagnosis?,"Hello, 

I am just reaching out because I believe I am suffering from moderate depression, but I'm not certain and I am trying to find where to get a diagnosis. For context, I am a university student and my university only seems to offer counseling and therapy services, but I am purely looking for a diagnosis. Would I need to find a psychiatrist or schedule an appointment with my primary care physician? Not really sure, as I have never sought for mental health help. Thanks."
658,"do i have a bad therapist, or am i just too sensitive?","i’ve been seeing my therapist for about four months now and at first my sessions did provide me with some relief. prior to treatment i was very isolated and i felt very alone, so it felt good to finally pour my heart out to another person who i thought would be understanding. over time though, i’ve began feeling more distrusting of my therapist and i’ve left my sessions feeling misunderstood and a sense of abandonment. there have been a lot of instances where my therapist will respond to my worries and anxieties with “that’s normal” or “everyone feels that way sometimes”. at first i let it go because i knew they were just being realistic, and likely said those things to ease my worries and make me feel less abnormal, even though i perceived it as being dismissive. but it became hard to brush off when it became more of a constant than an occasional reminder. at our recent session i tried to express my recent suicidal ideations and somewhere along the conversation my therapist said to me “people kill themselves all the time, it happens everyday”. i’m not sure of the intent behind that response, but it felt hurtful and dismissive. i also perceived a noticeable switch in their tone and they became more harsh and demanding when they began asking about my family and the trauma they would go through if i killed myself (they insisted they weren’t guilt tripping me, but why bring it up in the first place if not to make me feel guilty? there is no other purpose i could think of.) in general i just don’t get a very caring/warm/empathetic vibe from my therapist. when i begin crying and shutting down in our sessions, they just stare at me silently, waiting for me to stop. their responses are mostly geared towards making progress or finding solutions, which i understand is an essential part of therapy, but i feel like sometimes i just need to be able to feel that this person i’m telling all of my deepest feelings and secrets to actually cares about me and feels badly when they see me hurting. this is my first experience with therapy, i’m not sure if it’s my abandonment issues causing me to over analyze our conversations together, or if our personalities clash. i also wondered if all therapists are supposed to be more detached to maintain professionalism, or are there some out there who would be more openly empathetic?"

660,Natural Light for Depression?,"I have had two bouts of legit depression in my life. Both times I sought professional intervention. It was … rough. 

There’s a lot going on in my life right now, and sometimes I worry about #3. Someone showed me an article today about natural light.

I don’t have SAD, but I think getting more sunlight in a healthy way might help ward off that third bout. I mean, not that ALONE, but it might help.

Has anyone else tried light? Natural light? Light therapy? 

I’m just looking for others’ take/experience.

662,"""Quest for Inner Peace: Balancing the Desire for Freedom and the Pressures of Modern Life""","I sense desperation. I just want to leave everything behind and go somewhere far, with trees, forests, and fields, away from the hustle and bustle. I wish someone passing by would just say, ""Here's some money - for me, it's charity and small gestures."" That's it; I'm getting a second apartment, renting out one, living in the other, and I don't need to work damn 6-12 months at least. I'm tired; everything inside me hurts and screams. Work triggers allergies, any kind of work. I silently or subtly cry out to my loved ones: ""Save me, let me feel relaxation and peace, let me forget about the damn work, about people, about everything. Give me a safe place to hide and wander, not thinking about tomorrow. Just let me live life, not exist like a squirrel in a wheel."" But no, everyone says, ""Go through it, become stronger and more mature. Everyone goes through this. What do you mean you feel tired, that you have no energy? There's no such thing in adult life."" And I just spent my best years from 22 to 30, working 12-16 hours a day, trying to buy an apartment, and not getting to enjoy life. And now, everything seems peaceful, but this feeling is killing me. I feel nauseous from people, simply have no strength to tidy up, talk, endure work, or someone else's emotions. Can anyone relate, and how did you cope, or how did it all turn out for you? I hope at least someone had a person show up with a suitcase of money as a gift."
663,Not brushing teeth - Mad at myself,"I’m 23 and have struggled with chronic depression for seven years, I made myself brush my teeth this evening, I don’t know why - every night I go to the loo and my toothbrush is there but I just never brush them, today I was thinking I can’t even remember the last time I brushed my teeth in the evening, in the morning I’m always in a rush for work so just brush them quickly, and on my wfh days I just don’t. I was looking in the mirror and saw my front teeth have gotten whiter as the enamel has gone from them more, I’m so mad at myself, I hate myself so much, enamel can’t even grow back and I’m only 23. I eat so much sugar aswell because I struggle to make any other food, so I just know I’ve done this to myself and I’m so angry at myself. I’m trying to tell myself it’s not the end of the world, but I feel like so often I feel like I’m not depressed and just faking it and then I’m looking at these white spots like what have I done to myself, why do I feel this way, why can’t I be normal. I’m just so angry at myself, I’ve set myself a timer to try to remind myself to brush them every evening, but I’m doubtful it’ll work, some evenings I can’t even be bothered to go to the loo so I just hold it for hours and hours, my bathroom is ten steps from my bed. I’m so fed up of being depressed but I don’t know how to be truly happy or normal all the time. I’m so angry at myself. "

Of a time in my life where all the people dearest to me have already passed away, or don't care about me anymore and I'm left all alone nobody there to take care of me, or for me to try and take care of back.

The thought of being all by myself in this world surviving each day in a dangerous and hostile world is awful. I can't even fathom it.

I'm not too far away from that day today. I'm well into adulthood by now. I still live at home, and my family wants me to move out actively.

673,"What does ""remission"" look like?","I've been suffering a pretty bad depressive episode for several years now. With the right combination of meds, I'm finally at a place where I'm able to sort of take care of some of my basic hygiene. I'm working again most days. And I only have suicidal thoughts maybe once a week or so.

Today my psychiatrist suggested we change my diagnosis from ""moderately severe depression in partial remission"" to ""in complete remission."" Which is weird to me, because I'm still struggling and my meds are the only reason I can function at all. Does this really count as remission? She told me it's remission when you've gone 4-6 weeks of feeling okay after a depressive episode.

I asked her not to change it yet.

I feel sort of, I don't know... invalidated? I'm still struggling. And I'm always one day of skipped meds away, from being back to unable to work or function at all. Is this really remission?"

I'm socially inept and as I've gotten older I don't even care about my lack of a social circle. All I do is wake up, sit down at my desk to work and then feel trapped by an invisible cage. My days exist to work and then wait till my family goes to sleep so I can stay up late to be alone. Each night I put off going to bed because I don't want tomorrow to come and end up having to repeat in my head you don't have to wake up to drift out to sleep.

I can't kill myself because it wouldn't be fair to my family. I always hope my body gives out in my sleep and that's the end. I know I'm depressed but there always feels like there's just something fundamentally wrong with me.

I had a relationship which made worth living for a bit until she practically discarded me. It has tarnished my self esteem and I have hit rock bottom. I almost failed my semester exam because of the whole breakup, my parents are also giving up on me and I am just pretending to be okay so that they don't make me feel worse. I go to therapy but it hasn't made anything better yet. I gave my all to this relationship and made it my only purpose of living. My friends don't even check up on me given they have witnessed my terrible condition. I feel like a burden because all I do is sulk around and none of my friends really want to hangout with me or talk to me. I feel the worst because I have always been there for my friends when they were struggling but they don't seem to reciprocate it a bit. Nobody really checks up on me. My parents are homophobic and have literally asked me to stop being depressed over the breakup because they don't want others to assume my sexuality. I have a friend who checks up on me daily but I feel guilty as all I do is sulk around and doesn't have any fruitful conversation. I still don't know how can people just forget my existence when I have been nothing but good to them. I still can't fathom the treatment I got at the end of the relationship, the awful things they have said after being there for them when they were at their weakest. I just wear myself thin for every person and every bond in my life and in return I barely get any of it. I have always been depressed and that relationship kinda made me feel alive for a bit, but now I am just lonely, friends and my parents don't really care about me anymore. And all I do is try to reason everything out but at times it's just too much to even rationalise things. I don't really see a point in living and I know I am just too coward of a person to kill myself. So I don't know what to do, I really wish every night that I don't wake up the next day. I am barely surviving and slowly withering away. I don't feel good enough to even exist tbh, I know I am so young and have so much to look forward to, but I don't want to continue living like this, I can barely trust anybody anymore, I just want to isolate myself in a room and wither away.

682,Healing from depression: Is it normal to want to leave the friends you made while you were depressed?,"So I’ve definitely been pretty down the past few years and have completely lost myself. I would say I learned a lot during that time period but would definitely call it a period of depression: no joy, numbness, sleeping in, loss of enjoyment in passions, loss of creativity, tons of self doubt that I buried in false personas… you get it. 

But I’ve noticed that I’ve made some of my “closest” friends during this period, friends that I would turn to and would be there for me no matter what and it felt like we could talk about “anything.” Even if those “anythings” were just spirals of negativity and fear and me being inauthentic. It felt like those friends were comforting, and all that I had. I rarely felt enjoyment being with them, in fact, I mostly felt misery, so I’m very torn with what to do as I’m learning to be myself and enjoy life again. It feels like those friends don’t even know me, and they just keep me stuck in the person I was when I was deep in the shit. 

So I guess my question is: can anyone else relate? Is it normal to lose the friends you made during depression as you heal back to your healthy self? Or is it better to try to take them with you since they were there for you through such a dark time? ✌🏼"
683,regretting regret?,"does anyone else look back on moments you didn’t enjoy cause of your depression but in hindsight realise these were positive / good moments that you didn’t ‘enjoy’ enough cause of your depression then just get doubly depressed regretting the way you behaved.. any way to avoid this pattern of thinking?

684,How can I cure my boredom/depression," I'm an average guy in my twenties, struggling to find motivation in life. I'm stuck in a monotonous routine of work, anime, gaming, and mindless scrolling on social media. I have a weak body, short attention span, and often feel depressed. Nightmares haunt me, and I sometimes have unsettling thoughts. I feel emotionally numb and disconnected. 

Deep down, I know I still have some kindness and self-awareness left, but everything seems to be falling apart. I'm becoming cold-hearted and empty inside, oblivious to the world around me. 

Given my unhealthy lifestyle and unstable mindset, I wonder if there's anything positive I can do to improve my situation. There are a few things I've thought about, but I keep procrastinating or avoiding them, thinking they require too much effort. I have a strange interest in stutter/flash videos with Stutter Techno songs in the background, like a high-minded experience.

I've poured out my thoughts and experiences here, and I might come back to this post later. I don't have high hopes of finding someone similar and learning how they overcame their challenges, but I'll see.
And fuck me, this text turned out way too long."
685,daily dread,"everyday i dread the next. waking up and doing this bs all over again. knowing i'll struggle just as much tomorrow as i did today. when i was 8ish and first heard the phrase ""if i die before i wake, i pray the lord my soul shall take"" i've prayed that i wouldn't have to face another day of misery."
686,I finally made it out of the hell hole.,"There are various reasons for people to go into depression. I too had many. As insignificant as it may seem, people pleasing was one of them. Please do give a read.

We live in a society where things must go as predicted. This is the reason we all try to do our best to keep things in order and hoping for them to go our way.I too, was trying my best to keep things in order and ensure they function smoothly. In that process I relied on external validations (Smile,head nod,compliments etc) to feel more useful to the society. But then things went down to an extent where I gave up on everything. Looking back, few people did tell me to learn to say no, and I didn’t think much of it. For me saying ‘no’ to others equated to being selfish. And after deep introspection I realised that every time I said ‘yes’ reluctantly even when I knew it wasn’t a big deal, I was putting others before me.

To my subconscious mind:

>It meant I valued others feelings more than mine.

>It meant I valued others time more than mine.

>It meant I valued others happiness more than mine.



Your subconscious mind takes everything in. And when you're depressed, it only pushes the negative thoughts to your consciousness and these thoughts disort the perceived reality. Be careful about what you put into your subconscious mind. It takes everything inside.



For me saying 'yes' reluctantly, was like putting on a ‘YES MAN’ mask. And when I moved to a new place,I consciously and subconsciously,started feeling inferior to others.Anxiety started kicking in, my life started falling apart. In fact,I would never negate others opinion just to fit in and to not come across as rude. I started treating others more nicely than I would treat myself.I kept everyone on a pedestal.It’s a rule of nature that if you are ALWAYS selfless, you’ll perish.



I did have lot of friends. Like they say, a friend of all is a friend of none. It didn't feel like they were legit ones. I didn’t feel like being my  true self around them because I wasn't completely comfortable/myself around them. This obviously led me to having people who didn't match my vibe. But still, I used to hang out with them for drinking, road trips and clubbing. But everytime I needed an emotional support, I couldn't get any from the ones I thought would be helpful. Also my girlfriend at that time would always get things her way.I don’t blame her,It was her circumstances that made her that way.We are all products of our traumas and how we manage them.





It shouldn’t be surprising that I  spiralled down into severe depression because of self loathing and no emotional support.I popped almost every class of anti-depressants there were over a span of 8months.After Meds, CBT and lots of reading,I came across being ‘Selflessly selfish’. It means you should not think about being good to someone nor being evil to someone ,just don’t think about them at all.Obviously ,do make some  exceptions for family and close friends but, even then you should be the first priority. As clichéd as it sounds before the flight takes off ‘ when the cabin pressure drops, you should put on your oxygen mask before you help others.’ It applies to every aspect of our lives. Only when you are safe, you can help others be safe.



During my depressive phase, all I had were negative thoughts. I even attempted to end it. I’m glad the rope broke. Since then I have lost the fear of death, after all I attempted to bring it on me.



 ALWAYS remember two things:

>It’s not the thoughts that are problematic, it‘s the amount of importance we give to them.

>Thoughts are not reality.

Once I realised the problem, I was able to peel that filter which only let negative thoughts into my minds eye.



Since then, I have thrown that mask  away.I have been myself truly. I started expressing my thoughts which also meant I started negating others whenever it felt appropriate. I started saying ‘no’ to people whenever I felt I should be prioritising myself. I saw a few changes:



I felt more confident.

My friend circle started changing, I started attracting people of my vibe.

Energy parasites detached.

I started loving my life rather than just trying to survive it.

My current girlfriend makes me feel at home.



It’s surprising that seemingly small things can you can control impact you to an extent where you lose your grip on life.

Presently, I’m working as a doctor.

You know, being a doctor is cool and all, but my proudest moment wasn't actually getting through Medschool. It was overcoming depression. That was the real fight.

And always remember:

687,Inner demons,"**NOTE: Grammatical errors and SUICIDE. This is just my inner thoughts at the moment where I was really down. I need outside perspective on what's really going on. It's okay if you guys are completely brutal and honest with me.**

.............

Well the conclusion is I am an absolute TRASHHH nothing I ever do is rights apparently I just copy pasted everything... Maybe they're right... but it was supposed to defined each qualities but my mistake was that I didn't put an in text citation. I paraphrase each line though... Fckk it just accept it there's nothing to lose anymore. I've got nothing. I am nothing just a good for nothing. All I do is bring people down. Swallowing another shame huhh honestly at this point I've grown numb to my faults after all I've become nothing but mistakes, flaws and everything miserable. Just absolute TRASHHH PLS DEEI PLSS JUSTTT STOP ALREADYYY

They say that the better thing to do is just accept and learn from it. I want to honestly but... what else am I fighting for my pride?? Wat pride? Ego? Probably? I guess I just wanted to feel like maybe Ii aint like a trash after all... but time and time I was proven wrong. That I could do something right. I want to take a break just be alone somewhere far away pls just take me away. So shameful. Everyday feels like I'm being corrupted slowly not by my surroundings but by myself. I'm feeding myself poison each day and I'm slowly dying. Probably because I am addicted to it.

But another side of me just says to accept it there's nothing I could do about it nah. Be the bigger person and overcome it. And it's what I trying to do. Honestly at this point it seems like I am so detached from myself that even if you completely publicly humiliate me it wouldn't matter to me anymore. Throw me to trash I just wouldn't care. What I would do would just analysed each situation like some mathematical problem to be solved. Without feeling anything I guess that's my biggest problem. A problem to be solved and something to get dopamine from. Just like a math quiz on paper, something I just fo to do but at least quite fun. It feels like just a machine walking not me not my whole being just a character to this world. A mass of problems and contradiction."
688,another glimmer of hope vanishes...,"This will probably be stupid...

Every time I see a little glimmer of hope for a new start it vanishes...why? I thought that finally I found someone that wanted to start something new with me.  Yet I found out they like my sister...and they've been probably been kind, and talking with me almost every day just to me just to get closer to her... I'm so fucking dumb, but the worst part is that I can't do anything to save them from my sister... she's the pinnacle of toxicity...once again,  I'm sranding here,useless and at the bottom of the lake. 

Sorry for this post, I have no one and this was the only place where I could vent...what should I do."
689,do meds not work for you guys either?,"meds have never really worked for me. off meds i feel completely like blah but sometimes i get mood swings that help me feel happy, which is great. sometimes my mood swings make me feel pretty bad too, but at least i can be happy. on meds i always just felt blah. no ability to get happier or sadder, just blah. all empty all the time, off meds and especially on meds. it got exhausting trying to explain to my psychiatrist every time how i felt when it never felt like it changed me for the better, so i stopped taking meds. i still feel blah. i tried at least four different meds? some were combined sometimes. for you guys who never really worked with meds at some point, was there a medicine that ended up changing everything?"
690,How do I ask my doctor for help ,I’ve never went to the doctor about my mental health. Lately it’s been getting unbearable and affecting my school and work. I’m very nervous and anxious to bring up my thoughts and experiences with my doctor. How did you guys do it. Is going to my GP enough or will I get referred to another doctor. Thank you!! 
691,"Very unfit, need help","How much should I walk each day? I get pretty fatigued for the rest of the day if I walk even like 2 or 3k steps and it stops me from being productive. Especially on hot days when I walk for too long I get dizzy.

I used to be able to walk an hour in the soaring heat to work each morning, uphill as well, and then still work for 8 hours, walk back and also go out in the evening. 
 I do much better for example with working out in my room although I need to stop after like 15 to 20 minutes when my muscles give up. But I dont feel as fatigued after, infact I feel a lot better, just sore.

 Ive been really depressed in my home, my diet and sleeping rhythm sucks and I barely move, its horrible. I always tell myself ehh Ive been moving more and doing more but its never anything consistent. Whenever I get hit with the fatigue I just feel frustrated and awful. Working for 3 hours now feels like a full day shift.
 A very gradual and awful decline over almost a whole year now and I dont know how to stay consistent and pick up my life again."
692,I wanna kill myself but what if there is a hell as well as this world waiting for me,Please check my last post if youre interested why im looking for ending my life.i got trapped in hell
693,"I dont know what to do, I dont know how im supposed to feel","I've delt with depression twice before in my life, once as a teenager when I was getting bullied by my friend group and again when I ended my relationship with my mom. And now I seem to find myself reliving my depressive symptoms with no explanation that I can think of. 

I dont want to live anymore, I feel alone, I feel isolated and I feel like nobody truely cares about me. The only urges I feel is to live the rest of my natural life in suspended animation, not alive but not dead. 

For the past three years I have been living with my girlfriend and her family after my mom kicked me out of her house. They have accepted me into their home and have told me that I am their family and have taken very good care of me these past couple years. After I got kicked out of my moms house all I had was the clothes on my back and $50 to my name, I now own my first ever car, put myself through college and landed a pretty good job. Even tho I am in a much better place and ""a different person"" from who I was three years ago, I dont feel happy, I dont feel proud.

Even though I am in a much better place I don't feel like I have any sort of value. There's nothing keeping me tethered to this earth, there are no pets that depend on me for food, there are no humans who will be impacted by my death in any way shape or form. If I where to die this second, the memory of who I was will only be a passing thought to those who surround me. Maybe I am selfish for wanting to be mourned or for having something depend so heavily on me, but I don't think its wrong to want to be wanted. My partners family say that loves me, her sisters call me brother and her parents buy things with me in mind (like picking up a pack of pogo's because they know I like them). Despite all this I do not feel like they truly do love me. I never get a ""how was your day?"" ""how are you doing?"". Feeling like a ghost in the house, eating food and taking up space. Nobody seems to want my company or simply interact with me. And despite me being in a happy relationship with my partner, a part of me always reminds me that if I where to die that she would move on and replace my position in her life. I know its selfish I know its sounds fucked , but I am just so sick and tired of feeling replaceable, I want to feel permanent I just want to feel fucking loved. I dont know what if wrong with me, why despite being told that I am loved I dont feel it. I feel like I have my neck in the hangmans noose just waiting for the floor to drop from under me to put me out of my misery. 

So many times, so many countless times have I wanted to seriously injure myself just to be able to see how those around me will react. Who would visit me in the hospital? Who would stay by my side as I fight for my life? Who would cry if they heard that I was in a accident? who would be relieved to hear that I still draw breath? Like I drive my car and just imagine myself getting smoked my a semi, blood dripping from my head, consciousness starting to slip slowly by steadily away,I die without knowing it I would die without warning. And when I think those thoughts I feel good, relieved. Sometimes when I'm alone I put a knife to my neck and cry, I cry because I cant muster up the courage to do it. I fear death but I yearn it. My hobbies and sex dont give me any joy like they used to and noting but pain feels natural. I burn the tips of my fingers to constantly feel that pain, so that it lingers for days, so I can constantly feel those feelings of relief. 

Im fucked, and like the title says I dont know what to do. I havent told anyone about this because I dont want to be seen as fragile or as someone you gotta keep your eye on. I just want to be treated normally and these feelings to go away. I really just looking for answers or some advice.

694,My Journey So Far,"About 2 months ago I posted a Reddit post about how life had been lonely and depressing! But I came back on here to say it truly does get better you have to have faith even if you don’t believe, the last 2 months have been the best time of my life since 2020, I reconnected with people from my past, I went to the gym, I met some people by putting my self out their and just genuinely being me! Soon I’m going to be graduating a year early, I finally got my first job and now I’m working on getting my permit! I can truly say so little time can change your life and it will feel like it didn’t happen so quick. I can truly tell you their is a light at the end of tunnel you have to find it and do what’s best for you, I was just so stuck in the past mourning what doesn’t even exist anymore that I forgot I could be making new memories and look forward to the future I finally closed that part of my life that I truly wish to never go back to, and even if I’m still kinda lonely and working on stuff slowly I can say I haven’t been this happy in a long time! Time takes patience but it can be better and I just want all of you guys to know that if you all are struggling right now in life! It does get better!"

696,"Why ""life"" bother to exist when its literally just a bunch of atoms and particles","Why ""life"" bother to exist when its literally just a bunch of atoms and particles? 
There is no meaning to existence. It exists, and it disappears, everything in our perception will one day disappear, the world will end or the human race will end.
The “You” means nothing to existence. We are just a lumpy pile of matter that learned to rearrange other matters for their own benefit.
Your friends, family, they too are nothing. Just necessary bonds to your host for survival. There is nothing to the world. Everything, emotions, marvel, beauty, happiness, love, shock and pain, all came from “You”. From “your” perspective, the little chemicals in your brain dictates all that you feel and comprehend, as it was apparent through discoveries in the biology field. You must realize, there is absolutely nothing greater out there. No point to live, that is unless if you are religious and believe in an afterlife, which I meant absolutely no offence if this did. Life itself is a mishap. There is no point to its existence. Just convenient matter that happened to be able to stay together.
This is reality, where all “your” actions literally mean nothing at all. All “your” achievements, all that “you” love and “own”, is nothing. Existence doesn’t care. Existence is itself. Existence continue on without your opinion.
Its funny how people chases the small things in “life”. The price for a meal, the joy of watching make-believe movies, reading make-believe stories. Love. Fun. “You” are not getting anything out of that. Its all just “you”. “We” communicate to “ourselves”, saying how a tiny part of existence changed to “their” liking or mourn.
Yet, even knowing this, its impossible to escape this reality. It exists, and so did “you”. Its everything. “I” still feel sadness. “I” still feel excitement typing these words. “I” am a “useless” man. “I” know that. “Usefulness” all depends on the thoughts of “your” “matter”, at which I still am not.
“I” can see poets writing about love, singers on stages live for their crowds, “me” thinking about how to type in here. Why would we do that, when everything else is nothing?
After all, all that “we” can think about is “us” and even more of “us”, “our” offsprings will will probably continue on thinking the same thing, until the day that we all die and be forgotten. Until that day, we are still stuck in our small community on Earth, arguing about the latest stock changes and the price of oil.
Its harsh. I know that, I felt that. That is why I chose to ignore it. I chose to ignore my very own philosophical opinion.
Since there is nothing to nothing, which is meaningless, I might as well make myself think that there is something to exist for. The matter in me, when together they can feel joy, a concept that is enjoyable to me. I can feel the joy of others, and in turn I too feel joy. When I succeed in my tasks others and I set myself, I feel triumphant, even though it is ridiculously pointless to existence.When I post this somewhere on the internet, I will feel anticipation, hope.
I will let myself enjoy the “ignorance”, for now. My biological will to survive wants me to continue on to survive despite know the idiocy of life, and maybe to read other’s opinion on this. We are just so “We”, self-centered. Its impossible to feel anything other than what we perceive as “living”. Sometimes, maybe ignorance is happiness. Ignorance is bliss, and so I heard and confirmed.
My question is, after/even knowing that there is ultimately no point in existing since we will never achieve anything except for ourselves or accept the fact that we are too small to comprehend how self-centered we are, why do we still go back to our normal, everyday lives, or simply stop bothering about our own existence?

697,Problem with relationship ,I am depressed and my boyfriend had some issues last year but this year he tries to be good and does activities and stuff that I don’t have the courage to do. And I know it’s bad but I feel jealous and bad about myself and I get triggered all the time because he is feeling better and I don’t. I don’t know what to do 
698,My dad told me I'm a coward and deranged for being depressed and suicidal,"I'm 23 years old and jobless, just got out of a three year relationship and I am at the lowest point of my life. I'm too much of a coward to actually kill myself, but my will to live is just slowly fading away.

My parents have been somewhat supportive. My mom has always been there emotionally for me, but even her snaps out in desperation for seeing me suffer and not being able to do anything to help me. 

My dad is another story, he has always looked out for me financially and I know that he loves me, but he just has the emotional maturity of a baby. He has never looked out for me emotionally and always runs from any emotionally difficult situation, and I honestly resent him for that.

He said that suicide is for cowards that don't want to face life and that's when I told him about my suicidal ideation when I was 17, he didn't take me seriously and said I was just being dramatic.

Today he got pissed off because he sees no progress of me ""getting better"". I told him that I'm severely depressed, that I want to die but that I'm trying to get better one step at a time. I tried to leave the room but he stopped me, grabbed me and got physical with me; I thought he was going to hit me just like he did to my mom multiple times in the past. I pushed him away and yelled to him to never touch me again.

I went to my room and he confronted me, told me that suicidal people are cowards again and that's when I finally snapped: I told him he was a fucking idiot and a coward for running away from problems. I told him ""Then I should kill myself so that you can go around and say that your son died because he was a fucking coward""  He said to me that I was fucking crazy and deranged and I got ready to beat his ass and that's when my mom showed up to stand between us and de escalate the situation.

He ran away and according to my mom, he's been crying all day from what I said to him. I have never yelled at my dad or got physical with him, I love him, but I just can't when he calls me names at the lowest point of my life. I want him to be there for me, but he thinks that money will solve everything and has never bothered to be an emotionally present father.

I hate that I yelled to him like that, but I don't know if I can ever forgive him for what he said to me when my life is quite literally in danger."
699,My boyfriend is manically depressed and I can't help,"This is my first post about something like this, so sorry if this isn't the right place to ask for help.

For some context, myself (30F) and my partner (29M) are in a long distance relationship, but that has nothing to do with his depression. But this might be useful information to know when it comes to offering me advice. 

My partner has been in a manic depressive spiral for the past 2 weeks and I feel utterly powerless to help him. I have asked him what I can do to help, but he says I there's nothing I can do. I've told him I'm there if he needs to vent, or just distract him without fear of judgement or me abandoning him. He appreciates it, but i still have this awful feeling like I might say something to trigger him and subsequently upset him further. I also wish I could be there physically, but even then he says there's no guarantee that he'd be any less depressed.

I guess I just need advise on how to approach this and reassurrence that I'm saying the right sort of things. I don't want to keep asking him ""how are you feeling?"" Because I already know the answer. And he already knows I care about him. Immensely. 

I'm a very empathetic person so hearing how depressed he is upsets me greatly and today I had a full on hyperventilation attack from sobbing about it. But of course, I can't tell him that. I don't need to add to his plate of worry. I just want to be a pillar for him and for him to not worry about coming to me with his problems.


What do I do?"
700,the urge to completely and utterly ruin my life.,"im writing this in a rage and as some sort of outlet i guess. maybe i can get insight but the thought of someone else reading my experiences makes me feel more validated for some reason.

recently, ive been filled with so much grief and pain and anger for the world that i have the urge to just lash out and ruin everything. i want to ruin my health and my relationships and drop out of school and break things and just destruct everything in every single way. i want to break everything until i am left by myself and i want to be so self-destructive that im not even worth anything anymore. nothing feels real, i feel so apathetic to everything.

all my life ive been a mega people-pleaser, to an insane degree where i cant even enjoy myself around my own house for fear of siblings/parents being slightly inconvenienced. i know where this stems from (a long childhood of being the youngest child and constantly being told i was annoying/an inconvenience) but i dont wanna get into that. since birth ive been a punching bag for everyone else and nothing i ever say or do is taken into consideration. the world has always punched at me and i just want to punch back for once in my life. i want to do the impossible and just lash out and ruin everything. nothing is worth anything anymore. my whole life ive been so logical and calm and level-headed and peaceful but for once in my life, after just 17 short years ive had enough. i cant be the worlds punching bag anymore.

i dont know what i hope to achieve with this reddit post but i think putting it out there might help or something, i dont even know. im just so so so filled with feeling right now and i didnt know where to go."
701,"Can’t bear to live anymore, but won’t put loved ones through this ","That’s all. I’m on meds but nothing makes me happy and I don’t want to do anything at all. It’s deeper than that but that’s the short story. Thinking of doing something drastic to maybe “wake myself up”. Would love to hear if anyone has any stories where they managed to snap out of their depressive state without religion or romantic relationships (can’t do either). You know like maybe you went on a trip or realized something. Idk, anything is fine. "
702,Alternatives to therapy ,"
What are some good alternative's to therapy. Therapy ain't really gonna help me get enough money to pay bills and I don't think it would solve the bigger issues in life.

The other reason is that I'm too poor for therapy. I'm already skipping meals as it is.
Can't really get any aid either since I'm a dependent technically and my parents are upper middle but they only tell me to fuck off.

703,Loneliness is killing me,"I think there is no one to care about me. No one wants to talk with me. Unemployed from 8 months has resulted in depression and loneliness. Just to escape the reality, I used p**n but it's making me feel bad . My all friends are at good position and living a happy life whereas I am becoming suicidal.

Can anyone help me to get back in track with their personal experience. I can't take it anymore"
704,Afraid of this feeling.,"I was with this women for a year and we had moved in together, me, her, and her friend.
At the beginning I knew it might’ve gone sideways if I messed it up, we went a long while being together and enjoying the days we’ve had, she made me so happy. Then it slowly starts to go downwards once jealousy and clinginess got into play. It seemed as if I became too connected to this women. I started spending money i don’t have on her just to please her. I always wanted to spend time with her. I was always putting her before me. We had gotten into an argument, it was silly and dumb, but she had broken up with me because of it. I owned up to every mistake I’ve made and would hope she had the patience to let me learn. We are both young, i’m 20 and she’s 21. Obviously because we live together and her friend was there, she started talking to her friend, telling her everything I’ve done wrong, and now they both don’t like me. They talk about kicking me out and constantly ignore me. I pay 700 a month to live in this apartment and it kills me seeing her everyday and having her ignore me. She drinks heavily and is a very angry drunk… she’ll try to break me down completely. Insulting and threatening me. Saying she’s gonna fuck other dudes and if I’d “want that”. Being an overall emotional person, I’ve been put into the worst depression. It killed me thinking about how I’ve forgiven her for everything but she’s so quick to leave. I know I’m now an adult, but I can’t help but to cry, it makes me look weak but I just can’t help it. I’m stuck in a position where I don’t know how to let go, and I try so hard to rekindle things. It sets me back in life and I’m finding it so hard to do anything. It’s a terrible feeling, for a person to leave you because you didn’t suit her needs. Because you weren’t good enough. I know I shouldn’t come to Reddit with this, but I just never thought therapy was worth it. Talking to a person that doesn’t understand my feeling. I have goals and aspirations, but it’s so difficult and unmotivating with this feeling. How do I let go? How do I mask this feeling? "
705,Love is not a necessity.,"I remember as a kid when they taught the basic needs they always tried to shoehorn love onto the list. ""Food, water, shelter and love."" 

  
Having gone years without any love in my life, I can definitively say that it's not an essential need and the horseshit they tried to teach in elementary school was false. Everyone I've ever loved is dead, here I am, still alive. Miserable, but alive.   
"
706,my life isn't my own,"I just feel like my life isn't my own anymore. I've moved into my partner's house with his family, and I'm so far on the outside. I've lost all my routines, had to completely change my diet, moved into a dirty house, don't get a choice in my social life as people just appear here... I've tried to make new routines but it's so hard. I do all of the household chores for myself and my partner; I clean our space, I do all of our laundry, water our plants etc etc. I have also paid for virtually every single moving in expense. The amount of evenings I've had to spend with people that I dont want to see, doing stuff that I dont want to do is awful. I have barely done anything that I want to do in months. I've barely read, danced, watched my shows, done anything for me. I don't even sleep enough anymore because god forbid i want to go to sleep before 1am even tho i wake up at 7 every day. I can barely even have a proper shower bcs the shower here stops working after 15 minutes. My self hygiene and selfcare has just disappeared. My whole life is just spinning out of control and it feels like I'm just on the outside watching it spiral. All I do is go along passively with whatevers happening, barely sleeping and eating like shit. I hate this. I miss MY life. I miss me. How did I let this happen"
707,It's over,"Well! It's official. Life just isn't for me. I lived here on earth for forty years! Enough is Enough. I tried it, it didn't work out!!

708,Failure ,"I fuckking hate myself i'm the biggest failure ever exist, no matter how hard i study or work i never get good , my scores are always the lowest in class all my classmates and teachers make fun of how stupid i am, all of my classmates are really smart and can understand everything very quickly while i take hours just to understand it and always never do good in anything, you know what's the funny part? I wanna be a theoretical physicist 😂💔 i fucking hate my passion i wish i never had passion about anything and only cared about my look and sleep, i hate how i care so much about my future and want to be successful person(not rich because this  wasn't meant for me ) fuck it man i wish i never existed "
709,I feel like a burden ,"So I am 23, and as title says I feel so worthless, if I had to advice something to my younger self I would say commit suicide, before you are 18.
Life has been a shitshow for me, I have weakened myself so much, I can't feel welcomed when I am around people, I always feel like I don't belong, I am below them, I am never gonna be good enough. 
I just wanna drop out and become a NEET, cause I never feel good around people, they always remind me how much I suck, I am so ugly, with no intellect and can't even compete in my masters course, I just bunked last sem, I am trying to be regular in this sem but I feel like dying whenever I come back, I can't mingle with people, I have had this issue for last 8 years, I try to improve and change but I can never, still ugly with no communication skills, I have had this idea of trying to present more femininely but I can't cause I never feel good enough and feminine in terms of my physical self, and I have devolve into husk of a human, only time I feel better is when I am at home doing nothing or just gaming( and I am not even good at it), whenever I am in college I just wanna go back, I can't talk to people properly, professors are cunt they only care about attendance and they will never understand. 
I only wish that I had one thing of my desire going in my life, but I got ugly face, ugly body, a gender that I don't feel good about and fucking no talent or communication skills, or even fashion sense, I just see others and feel disgusted by myself, I feel sub par and like an alien, I have felt inferior for around 7-9 years now, and this feelings has gotten worse and worse, none of my efforts pay.
It actually gets worse, I started balding at 21, and now I wear hoodie and hat to hide my bsdk shaven head, it gives me dysmporhia and dysphoria, haven't taken a picture in 9 years, haven't ever had a real friend, always shallow interactions and idk how to be normal like others, how come I can never be good enough, idk everyone says good stuff and it gets better when I talk to people online, but I can never fucking her anywhere irl.
I just wanna die, run away or become a NEET and stay shut in forever, I don't have any place in real world, I am not normal like others and I just wanna die, nowadays I am thinking about jumping on the metro track or jumping from college building. 
Real shit is the feeling it's always the same, no matter what I do, I have lose hope about stuff, have been trying to change myself for quite a while now, you can say 5 years minimum, but shit only got worse. Now I am In a sport where I just wanna fucking become invisible or better yet stop existing, can never feel good enough to be with people, and none really wants to be with me anyways, so alone and worthless, I feel like a burden when someone is paired with me, like a dead weight...
Idk have been years I don't even feel like it is gonna change anymore after years of never getting good enough or better than I was, my sister and parents love me, and she said no to self harm but I can't, I wanna punish myself now for being not worth it for anyone. I feel like a burden to my parents too, I can't really see a way out of this, maybe in next life. "
710,I wanna die,.
711,not sure how to get back,i’m not sure how to get back to the way i used to feel. i’ve been stuck in a depressive episode for a few weeks now and i genuinely just don’t know how to get back to feeling happy. i could win the lottery and id still cry because i just feel so sad all the time. it’s starting to get to the point where i’m crying daily and snapping at loved ones. last time it got past this point i ended up in a hospital. i’m just now sure what to do at this point. i’m worried that before my new medication kicks in i’ll say something i don’t mean to someone that i love. is there anyone who went through this and has advice? Thanks for reading.
712,am i having a mental breakdown?,"i wrote this while crying also english is not my 1st language so excuse me if some things don't make sense 

ive been depressed for a while now so that's nothing new but today after school i just immiendetly broke down crying. thats not that unusual for me either but today it was diffrent. the feeling ive felt today actually reminded me of the grief the day i found out my grandma died. ive had this feeling of unwashable hoplessness since i first broke down today. i had a panic attack like this once but it lasted less than an hour, but ive been feeling like this for the past 7 hours and I'm scared this feeling won't go away and ill stay in this horrible mode of grief and hopelessness forever. 

after today i strangely wanted to go back to school, which is weird cause i do not enjoy school these days. I don't have any friend's at my new school and the amount of missed schoolwork is making me stressed out. but suddenly the thought of being at school felt comforting.

an important thing i should tell you is that last week one of my teachers asked me after class what was going on since i had so many absences. i ended up telling him i had depression. he was really nice about it and i felt good after that interaction. but after that for the next couple of days until i had a class with him i felt so anxious like nauseating type of anxiety to go back because i guess the thought of someone knowing about my problems made me really anxious for some reason. and don't get me wrong!! this teacher is nothing but the best. being back in class today wasn't bad at all, since the teacher is really nice. 
 but then i broke down the second i got home.

am i having a mental breakdown or something? im so lost and I don't know what to do "
713,I'm such a fucking loser.,"Everything I do, I do wrong. I let everyone down all the time. I ruin the mood. I fuck up the vibe. I'm a burden. Nobody knows what to do with me. Everything I do is ""too much"". I think I might be having an autistic meltdown rn but I haven't been diagnosed so it could just be in my head. Idk what is wrong with me. I have such a strong feeling my long-term partner is about to cheat on me. I feel like I'm about to lose this really, really good job. Working on SO hard for me. So fucking hard. I push every day not to do something drastic. But God damn. I guess I will just go to sleep since I can't do anything else right. I'll end up fucking myself over again like I always do because I am incompetent. I hate that I let everyone down. I can't do anything right. Trying my best never amounts to being good enough. I wasn't meant for this world but I can't do anything to leave. I'm stuck here for a while. It just really hurts. I can't even afford medication, therapy, or doctors visits. I don't want him to cheat on me or feel unfulfilled in our relationship because I can't give enough. I'm not good at sex. I'm not fun. I'm mean and cranky all the time because I am in pain. And I can't go back to working an in-person job with lower pay. I might give up if I have to do that. I'm trying so hard not to give up. None of my friends believe a word that comes out of my mouth. My promises mean nothing because I won't stand by my word. I flake. I let people down. I won't follow through. I wish I could just leave. I don't want to be here. I feel like I want to crawl out of my skin. Everything just really fucking hurts. There is no remedy except waiting it out, whatever this is. It hurts."
714,I hate myself,I have too much shit in my head I’m overthinking like..I can’t open up to literally anyone in the world and even people who are close to me and “care” it feels like a waste of time and emotion talking about how I feel because at the end of the day no one understands in my life or will care. It’s so hard to say anything that has some emotion of how I feel I’m sick of hiding everything I feel so tired from life. I want to isolate myself from this world but when I try people try to talk to me but it makes it more stressful for me to deal with anyone. Idk how to really explain how I feel I’m so bad at talking I keep everything in my head to myself. 
715,Did anyone else’s depression get worse as an adult? ,So I (23m) have had major depressive disorder since I was like 13. I did have a real hard time in school when I was a teenager. But like now that I’m an adult it feels like my depression got 10 times worse than it was before. The past couple of years have been awful. Just traumatic event after traumatic event. Can anyone relate? 
716,Depression is taking over my life in som small ways and slme big ways,"My doctor prescribed som anti depressant a couple months back but i was always too scared of what they might do to me and how i would act when i would take them so just didnt take them.
And my depression is at a point where everything is hard. Brushing my teeth have become a job that i just dont want to do, and have then skipped it unless im gonna go out. I dont do it when i go to sleep or when im just in my apartment and not going out. School is also hard, i dont have much school but still icant manage to get ro school. Does anyone else have this problem? I feel like i am stuck and dont know what to do"

Yes, I have it much better than 90% of people, that's upsetting, still, i'm on medications, therapy, nothing seems to be working"
718,I can't make sense of why I won't let myself be better,"\----Throwaway account because this is very personal to me 

&#x200B;

Dear all,  
I'm writing because I'm in a really tough spot right now. I've been feeling like I'm battling with myself for a long time. I've tried to be kinder to myself, but it's like there are different parts of me that don't get along, and I can't figure out which side to support. I want to start by saying that I want myself to be better, I really do. Writing here is also helping me in a way. I hope you can follow along because this is quite unstructured, and I am writing in the order things are appearing in my head.   
When I was 15, my parents went through a really bad divorce. It was filled with violence, both physical and verbal, and a lot of mental abuse that lasted for years. Luckily, I've always had good friends and people I could count on.  
As time went on and I stopped talking to one of my parents because they left me and never talked to me again. I started binge drinking for months on end when I was really young and never got the confidence or self-esteem that my friends did. Even though I'm good-looking, tall, and smart, I feel small on the inside, like a tiny version of the outside me. I often have to act like I'm okay and confident, like what people expect from someone like me, but it's hard.  


I hate the fact the parent who abandoned me is doing so well in life and I can't start building myself. I hate that in essence, they won. They broke me and I never recovered. My other siblings are no better either and as the eldest I feel like I failed to help them because I couldn't help myself. One of them almost killed themselves due to an eating disorder while the other one is growing up with their first memories being of my parents fighting.

  
My other parent gave me a lot of chances in life, but I always end up feeling sorry for myself and really hating who I am because I don't do as well as I think I should with these chances, which makes me feel guilty. I've been through heartbreak and never got over it. I've felt everything from not caring to being sad, hopeless, and desperate, and my ability to get things done has changed a lot. I even hate the way I cope with negative emotions. I wish I could suffer ""differently"".  
The emotions I deal with are too much for me sometimes, and I've thought about suicide more than once because of it. I never went through with it, although I was very close, because of the guilt I'd feel towards others who love me and how it would affect them. If my non-existence had no effect on them at all I would have probably done it by now. 

I've been to therapy and I am still going, but it only makes me feel okay for a few weeks or months before I fall back down again. I feel happy for a while at times and even motivated. I get a lot done when that happens. The problem is that I can't stop wanting to punish myself and not let myself get better or grow. Therapy is good, but it can't seem to ""fix me"" despite my best efforts.  
I feel jealous, guilty, and overwhelmed.  
The idea of not trying makes me feel guilty towards the people who have always been there for me and given me everything. But trying is always so hard and painful. I'm fighting against myself in an uphill battle.  
I want to help myself, and I have before. I exercise regularly, study, and am in a relationship now. But I can't keep my emotions steady, and the smallest things throw me off.  
I stopped drinking a few months ago, and it helped at first, but now I feel just like I did when I was drinking.  
I also smoked weed for about 6-7 months straight because I couldn't sleep and needed something to distract me. I quit that 6 months ago as well.   
I don't know where to start. My life is exactly how I want it to be right now, with all the perfect chances to get better, but I can't stop trying to hurt myself through failure, giving up on myself, and thinking negatively. I wish I could be more free, less socially anxious and just generally more willing to stand back up when life (naturally) pushes me down. 

I have a lovely intimate relationship, great friendships that have endured since childhood, a loving parent and many loving family members. I have nice siblings and I had so many opportunities I am grateful for in life. The fact I feel this way is due to some dark unexplainable force inside me that fuels self hatred, even though I can perceive how lucky I am and how much good is in me and in my life in general. 

I hope one day I can start facing life fully and not with half of me always working against me. That will be the greatest day of my life. I can feel like I can achieve so much if only I felt a bit more consistent emotionally.

&#x200B;

I miss being a child, I was truly happy then. It makes me sad thinking how weak I became and who I generally became. Younger me would be embarassed.

719,"I hate myself and my life, and I can't fathom feeling any other way","I'm drowning in depression and don't know what to do anymore. 
I'm a single mom, disabled by multiple chronic illnesses that keep me from being able to work at all so I live in extreme poverty. I have no support system and barely any friends. Just me trying to take care of 2 kids while being constantly tortured by my body. Every day is an endurance challenge from hell. It has made me a grouchy miserable person. I feel no joy. I've become a crappy mom that just grouches and bitches all the time. I don't mean to be, I'm just so broken. But it's not fair to my kids and they deserve someone better.

721,Why do I fail to understand emotions?,"I don't understand my emotions very well. I fail to relate to others on many occasions. This has cost me my romantic relationships, many friendships, and has severely damaged my mental health.

I don’t have anyone who understands me; I feel that every day. Even if someone comes into my life, I won’t be able to express anything to them because I myself am not able to understand what the heck is wrong with me.

There’s no book that can teach us how to make friends or form good relationships, so I will never be able to understand them. However, I’m working with a therapist on this topic.

But I’m good with math and understanding science a bit, so I tried this approach. Here’s my experience with the science behind emotions. It might help those who struggle with emotions like I do.

[Why do I fail to understand emotions?](https://arshad-kazi.com/why-do-i-fail-to-understand-emotions/)"
722,Am I the real problem?,"Idk how to start this...
But I'm struggling with a lot...
I have health conditions and symptoms that got worse with my unmedicated mental health for several reasons and not excuses.
Today I made Mom left our home because I'm just a bad person that do not care about my own life or others.. and I'm supposed to be their right arm but I failed to make these work EVERY SINGLE DAY.. because if ONE DAY I couldn't even wake up at a certain time, HELL is waiting for me. The fact that I'm 24F and living in Asia, so the concept of a strict family with (hidden NPDs) is still existing. 

But maybe I'm just a coward... my parents are old (and Dad is the one has NPD but he is a different story that I recently managed to ignore him for the sake of my overall health).. but mom, she started unconsciously to be an emotional abuser like my father.... she never done bad things to me (only physically but emotionally... she is really good at making everything on her side) but to be honest she is kind when she is in a good mood.. but I'm NEVER meeting her standards and expectations EVERYDAY, because if I miss only one day, the only simple thing I can say that I am NOTHING to her, literally.. 

she is workaholic, perfectionist, believer, had a successful career, but she also had me, she don't want me to work because I have to take care of her... she succeeded, I gave up on looking for jobs because of this..I'm also the one acting like her Narcissistic Husband, the one who don't give a **** about her or anything else but his life and needs + I am the reason of her cries everytime I don't meet her standards and expectations. 
-----------------

My problem is that I learned not to express my feelings because I don't have the right since my brother's life worse than mine (he is disabled).
I once remember telling how I struggle, I wanted them to see that I struggle too.
I broke the wooden table once with my bare hands when they were not present because I was angry.. but once she knows that I did that she cried telling me ""don't act like your dad and your brother, they are enough for me.""

-----------------

I'm always the walking problem-solver for them.. I am that energy that suck up all their anger.. always listening and make things go easier.. I never get MAD my entire life. but please tell me and slap me in my face by the harsh trurth that I AM THE REAL PROBLEM.. so I expect my place in hell and prepare for it.

------‐----------

I realized I was doing everything right for their only sake and not mine... I studied hard just to make them proud.
And please don't lecture me how toxic this mindset because it is literally written in my core and it's hard to not think otherwise because I'm strongly emotionally attached to them.

I'm literally questioning my own existence from the age of 5.

Lol idk why did I even wrote this.. cuz who gives a f? I'm not seeking anyone's attention and I know this is a universal experience and no one will ever care and I only have myself in this process.. you know what? Fuck you, fuck me, fuck this society. I am a pathetic loser, bye."
723,this feeling *14F*,"the feeling im feeling right now, and have been for a while is where it feels as if theres a big heavy boulder in my stomach, and im lightheaded and i cant form any tears even if i wanted to , even tho im extremely depressed. ive gotten to the point where im too tired to type long paragraphs on how i feel, this is it right now. ill be happy for a day or two, or a couple hours but after that its just gone , i feel the same shit."

I’ve never felt so bad in my life (23M)
I don’t want to do anything but stay on bed and watch reels or TikTok and adult content (but even doing that brings emptiness)
I sometimes want to throw up or just cry without a reason. 

The situation: I am a college dropout whose identity was based on something I can’t do anymore. I have nowhere to go and no possibility of work till next month or change degree till October. 

People who’ve dwelt with this have my full respect. And to those people I ask for help in what to do to not continue to sink in. 

I dont want to unalive myself but I do want to stop existing. Like my sole purpose which was getting the degree has failed and my mind always follows the phrase “death before dishonor” that was incrusted during my time in military highschool.

I am a privilged person who has everything a human needs to survive and even more.
But somehow I am ungrateful and stuck in a loop of misery. I talk to nobody about my needs and problems. I only journal to express my thoughts. Sometimes I feel like I don't even have any needs. I feel worthless most of the times. 

I don't think that there is something wrong with me, but I feel that there is something missing.
And that's definitely human connection and a sense of purpose. I just have no drive. It's like a negative feedback loop that got me here. 
Everyday that I live is wasted. I feel out of control."

I get a sticker every day I go to work, and after getting 5/10 stickers I get a reward. Anyone have any ideas of what rewards should be for me? It's harder to come up with something for it since I'm an adult and not a child in elementary school lol thank you!"
728,I feel like I can’t sit down and relax,"23F, just graduated college in May of 2023, and live in an apartment with my partner. Currently holding a part-time job (10-3 for about 14.50/hr, so not terrible) and been recently trying to lose weight while also trying to do more art throughout the day.

Right out of college, and a little after I got my job, I started getting depressed. Felt like nothing was going nowhere, I wasted my degree and can’t do anything with it, and I was unsure if I was where I was supposed to be in that moment (ROCD is a bitch, as well as imposter syndrome). I started gaining weight, letting the apartment go to shit, did nothing all day when I’m home, and cried a lot.

Right after New Years, I had a few weeks of being ill and bedridden while my BF worked a lot of hours. On my only day alone, I was able to get up and do some chores and noticed how crappy of a state my apartment was in. So, that kicked into gear keeping up with chores and doing a massive overhaul on cleaning.

From there, I went to weight loss. I started with just dieting, but then it developed to now trying to get 30min + walk in and some light exercises when I get home. I’ve also been trying to learn how to cook. On top of this, I picked up learning to paint, while also planning to learn embroidery or Blender.

The thing is, now I feel like I can’t sit down. I feel… better? But the moment I sit on the couch and start to scroll on my phone, I feel like I’m going to cry and that I’m all alone and trapped in adulthood responsibilities. I feel like my life is so… BORING! I want to be doing more things in my life, or at least get a different job, but I have been struggling majorly to find something. But the second I get up and start moving around again, I am zoned-in and can do a lot.

This only seems to be the case when I’m home alone. I’m somehow fine if my partner is also home? Unless I’m by myself, which can start a depression spike.

Anyone else go through this? I feel like I can’t relax and it’s driving me nuts"
729,Can't get out of this negative loop,"I just feel so stuck in my ways, lately been more depressed. My ex left 1 year ago, I lost my job, and I am trying to start my online business myself, but it is very hard for me at the moment, it seems to go nowhere. I should probably get a more normal job, but I am just so depressed right now. I feel that at 33 I already failed too much, I am not where I would like to be, mostly just always sad, and I got out of my workout routine. My sleep pattern is also totally disrupted right now. Don't know how to get back on track, every day I just feel overwhelmed, and I am already on a lower dose of antidepressants. The last 2 weeks I have been smoking a lot of weed, now I stopped, but it seems all I want is to beam myself away. I also feel quite alone since I broke up with my ex, and feel too unattractive for dating at the moment. He said bad things to me, that he never met such a sad person, etc. I just feel sad on the inside and so blocked, like I cannot move into any direction, as I do not see hope and do not have energy. I feel so burned out. Looking for any advice or support. thanks."
730,Can one develop depression?,"Like through situational sircumstansesce and not through their heritage?
 If so, what causes it?"
731,A hole in my heart.,"I've been trying to write here for 2 years, but each time the story is too long because I like to write. So I will be brief. High IQ + sleep  Trouble + depression = diskjfkekzks. I can't name this, no matter how hard I try, I just have no luck. But no matter how much I advance, I become more and more apathetic, I feel less and less emotions. I have a literary degree and a degree in hydraulics and I work at McDonald's. I feel like Murphy's Law is constantly bearing down on me, that I always get the worst outcome from every choice I make.
All I want is to feel life like a normal person."
732,Extremely anxious and depressed ,Hi guys. I am extremely depressed and anxious 24/7. I’ve basically dealt with depression and anxiety my whole life since I was ten. I am now 25 and still can’t feel content with anything in life. I was in a relationship for four years which was extremely mentally abusive and took a lot from me. It’s been over a year and I feel like my life is still in shambles. I feel like my ex still speaks so ill of me. I also feel so lost since I sacrificed everything for that one person. No one gets me. I go to therapy and I still feel extremely overwhelmed. I got laid off as well for no reason. I just wanted to vent. I don’t feel like living sometimes. 
733,I wish my mom died. ,"I love her as much as I possibly could, but this isn't about her. She used to be the only person in the world who gave me hope that I could find what I'm looking for. She is the only one that keeps me going. But today she is no longer a enough of a reason to belive, to have hope. Still, she is a barrier for me, that tells me to keep living, because I know if I died, she would die right after me. But I no longer have hope, I only have a barrier. 

I wish she wouldn't love me so deeply, I wish I knew she would continue. But I'm lying to myself. And I selfishly wish she was dead so I could turn all of this off, without all of that guilt. 

She is the only one I can truly count on to care about me. No one else does, and I fucking wish they did. I wish they cared that I loved them. They don't. 

And I can't talk with anyone because I'm full of shame. If I told my friends what my love does, they would pity me. If I told my love what my friends do, he would pity me. Both would think I have no self respet, both would judge me for staying, for begging them to love me, to respect me. 

All I ever dreamed of was a house in the countryside. A partner who would crawld with me in it at night. And a room for guests such as family and friends to come and visit. That was all, but I can't have it. 

Nothing is ever mine. My job can be taken away, my house can be taken away, my friends come and go and my love is always leaving me. 

I don't want to be happy anymore. I want nothing. I just wanted to be loved. I wanted to share. I wanted someone that cared the way I feel I do. I can't find it. Maybe I don't deserve it, maybe it doesn't exist. Either way, I don't want to be here. "
734,Yep,"I don’t want to socialize (only at work). When people outside work come up to me and try to socialize. I get aggressive and depressed. My meds don’t work. I gave up on help. It’s driving me more insane. So I do what I can do best. Social isolate. It’s the only thing keeping me sane and not depressed.
"
735,I don't want to continue,"I have no hope of ever being happy. I don't understand why I have to keep fighting. I know that my loved ones would suffer enormously if I died, but why do I have to go on enduring my existence for them? They're selfish without knowing it"
736,Wish I knew how people even get by everyday.,"I wish I'm just a bubble head who just breathes everyday and be ok with living.

This is just a pointless rant. It is sad that I don't have anyone real to tell my deepest thoughts to without being judged."
737,Does smiling actually make it better? ,"When i was in the mental hospital i had a psychiatrist who im not sure was very good. Once i was doing a daily checkup with my psychiatrist and i was telling him about my issues and he told me my problem is im not smiling enough and to just think happy thoughts, saying that is my issue. What does this mean i cant force myself to have happy thoughts!! "
738,How's life,"How's things lady's and gentlemen 

I just want to know "
739,I don't know what to do anymore,"I've always struggled with depression, but when my marriage ended a little over a year ago I have been spiraling ever since. Binge drinking, doing drugs, over eating (or not eating at all), sleeping anytime I didn't have to be at work.. I stopped taking care of myself entirely. Not showering or cleaning my house or changing my clothes. The wave of sadness took over my whole body and mind and I just can't shake it. My depression has gotten so bad that I had to quit my high-stress job, thinking it would alleviate some of my sadness and I would become less miserable. I wanted to go back to school but was turned down for grants. Now I can't pay my rent and I will most likely be homeless soon. 

All of my family lives out of state. My garbage health insurance isn't covered by any therapists in my area, so seeking out help has been increasingly hard. I tried to end my life twice last summer and failed.

Most days I don't want to leave my room and I just can't stop crying. Sorry for the rant. I don't know where to even begin to start coping and dealing with my pain."
740,as the eldest... get all the responsibility... i'm so tired,"sometimes i'm thinking why i got all the responsibility.. im tired, i wanna rest but i cant

every since my mom get paralyzed, i became the head of the family with lots loans from the hospital... i am full time working at home + caregiver to my mom and to my siblings.

I don't have anyone to rely  on specially in financial as my brother and sister still studying. I wanna rest for at least one day without thinking of anything. i'm physically and mentally exhausted now. There sometime i'm wishing to just die so they will get my insurance and we will be free from debt and have some extra money for my moms medical expenses...

i'm really so tired now."
741,Feeling empty ,So low. Just don’t see any hope for the future. I’m rotting.
742,Turning 20 soon and I feel like I'm not living,"Hello,
So I'm a first year student at college in engineering and I've become lethargic and chronically bored. I'm turning 20 in less than a month and I've realised how I've fucked up everything already. I failed to live. Most people around me enjoy life, they hang out with friends, they have fun, or at least they're holding it together. People at my age have already had relationships, already lived their own adventures, and I feel like I've missed the boat. I do not know how to make friends anymore and have no experience whatsoever with relationships. 
For context, I lived with my parents, and was pretty introverted, during high school, mostly never hang out with anyone outside of class, I then did a 2 year pre-university program, with mostly the same attitude. Throughout high-school, I was enjoying my time, but wasn't really going out of my confort zone. Then at approximately my second year of the pre-university program, I started to actually want to socialise, meet people, and be less introverted. I couldn't, and didnt put really much effort into it. Then college came and move out to another city, didnt go into residence for financial reasons, and rented a studio alone. Problem is that the university life is inexistent. As a result, I have been extremely lonely for the first and second semester, tried socialising with people in class but most of them shut me down. I ended up finding 2-3 people who are friends, but we don't really hang out much, they're mostly too busy, even gets me thinking of whether we're even friends. I also tried myself at searching for a gf, although I'm aware that finding a gf will not wipe away my depression, at least it may help part of the process? Maybe? Anyway, I've only been to one date with this girl we talk a lot but I am considerably more attached to her than she likely is to me, and I am way too attached to someone that doesn't really care about me. She probably doesn't like me and I wouldn't even know if she's playing with me, but I'll keep pushing and see what happens. Also, I have to admit that I have started this process because I found uni life too dull and wanted some action. I am aware that this is a pretty unhealthy way of doing things, but now it's too late.
I also stopped enjoying things I used to enjoy, like gaming with friends, or reading. When I do that, I do it obsessively for 9h and don't even enjoy it. I am sorry for the poor structuring of my thoughts but the end result of all that, inability to find friends, no experience in relationships, no hobbies to enjoy, no university life, I feel bored, all the time. I have a lot of free time and I do not know what to do with it. I only enjoy time that I spend with other people, I am unable to enjoy time alone anymore. Its like I was switched from an introvert to an extrovert overnight but wasn't given the necessary social skills. I usually end up wasting my time on YouTube or other useless apps, feel much worse afterwards. So I do not know what to do, but I am not living, barely just surviving to time. I've considered suicide couple of times but never actually planned anything as it would hardly solve my problem, barely annihilate the fact that I'm not living. I would be interested in any tips or ideas or anything to get out of this situation."
743,My brother is moving away and I'm so sad,My brother is my best friend and I found out that he's moving away this spring and I'm so sad. He's my rock and he keeps me centered. Without him there my life won't be the same. I'll miss hanging out with him and remember everything we did together. I'm acting like he passed away but that's almost how it feels like. There will be a hole after he leaves
744,Depression has gotten worse,"Staying in bed longer, going to bed is hard.
More irritable than usual and doing reckless behaviour instead of being able to sit and enjoy the outside, and biting my nails too much that it hurts
I know what caused it. I mean, aside from depression and trauma but external factors also did it. Bad job. I am struggling in new barista role and it clearly is not for me, and I am given less hours than I was promised. Also I have been spending a lot of time with helping with volunteering that has made me feel empowered and because of job I wont be able to make important events"
745,I'm sad,"I've always been depressed at somewhat level since 7th grade, but I've been sad and helpless like this only a few times. I lost my ring. The ring my grandfather gave me before he passed away, my head feels like operating in a fog. I've lost my hunger, I feel tired I feel sad. Somehow this loss hit me hard than everything this past 4 years. Even death"
746,i don’t feel real,"Honestly this is my last resort before I do something that’s irreversible so i’m really hoping this helps. I’m a 15 year old girl in my freshman year of high school and I just got broken up with by my ex boyfriend last month. I know it’s pathetic how much it hurt me but it really did. He was everything to me and I miss him every single day he made my days so much more fun and eventful and he just broke up with me so suddenly, He supposedly relapsed on heroin but in reality he just found another girl and it was the girl I was worried about. I just hate how bored I am and how alone I feel, I tried to do substances to cope like benadryl, weed, opiates, and shrooms but honestly it’s just making me feel less and less real. I honestly just feel like I died when he left me and I know it’s pathetic but he was all I had i’m basically a loser at school and don’t have many friends and everyone thinks i’m weird, which i’m not I usually just keep to myself and don’t talk much but people still talk bad about me. I can’t get a therapist because my mom won’t let me. I’m just tired of being alive and living the same day over and over again. I know i’m probably being dramatic but I really can’t help how I feel and I just really feel numb and dull like a lifeless person and my eyes lost the sparkle they had which really upsets me I really do just look dead. I just want him back but I can never go back to how it was. I miss my old self and I just wanna be the person I was before I met him but for now I’m just tired of trying anymore. I really hope posting how I feel helps. Thank you to anyone who reads this."
747,Partner in Therapy - Advice ,"My partner of 10y has suffered from depression for a long time. I have had issues with depression in the past, and have bad days, but it is mainly under control through lifestyle changes and medication. My partner however, is still going through it. And has been on and off for the last 10+yrs. They are currently taking medication and going to therapy and I have seen them really make an effort in the past 2yrs. I am so happy that therapy is working for them and that they have an outside source to confide in. The issue is I feel that my partner doesn’t share their feelings with me anymore. We are either having a wonderful day together or they completely shut down. When I’ve asked them about it, they said it’s not my job to make them happy and that they will discuss with their therapist. We’ve also recently had some tragic events happen, so I don’t want to push. I honestly understand where they’re coming from and I want to respect their boundaries, and I never pry as to what was said in a session, but I feel left-out. I even feel jealous of the therapist sometimes, which I know is not healthy. Has anyone experienced this? I want to connect on a deeper level but I also want to allow them mental space. "
748,venting and confused,"!  
I think I may have depression. I'm from a lower-class household in Morocco, so mental health was not always a priority; we were just too poor, and we still are. Recently, my mother was diagnosed with it and was medicated. It was a tough few months, but she has mostly ""gotten over it."" When she was seeing doctors and taking medicine, I felt jealous because for the longest time, I have been through countless episodes of extreme highs and lows, but they never knew or just shrugged it off, saying, ""You're still young, what do you know?"" or ""You don't have time for this, go do stuff with your life."" You know how we are; we can't add this crap on us, kind of thing. But I don't know if I'm thinking like this because that is exactly what happened, or if it's all in my mind. I used to know when I'm in an up or down position, but now I don't know. Recently, I haven't been doing anything; I can't get myself motivated enough to do anything. I don't really want to talk, but I feel lonely af. I feel sudden bursts of ups, but they don't last, then I just go back to binging YouTube. I would watch anything; I can't sleep unless I put a silly video on so my brain would shut up. I have never reached out or felt the need for someone else to know what I'm feeling, so I never shared with anyone, but I know that I have been lower than this. I used to want to end myself; that feeling is not here anymore. For now, I'm so confused; I don't know what is happening to me."
749,Considering THE END,"Dont have much to write or rant about, just done with life, ill keep it short
I am 20

DISCLAIMER: NOT HERE TO BEG FOR MONEY

I have a major surgery coming up (don't have the money) , many other health issues too

750,School is making me want to die,My exams are stressing me out so much rn i have to hand in a portfolio at the end of this week and im so scared for it then my mum was shouting at me for not passing a couple of my prelims and then she said that she thinks im depressed 
751,That period where a girl and you don’t act friendly?,"As a young adult, i felt like i hit this brick wall with an aspect of socialization that i was true afraid to understand or confront, and thus overcome.

When you’re good friends with a girl, and you might like her and you might not, and she might like you and she might not, what do you do when things get sour?

If I as a guy don’t reciprocate some “feeling” she has for me, is it normal for her to act cold and mean? At some point, it even feels like she makes me feel bad on purpose. Or am I just missing the attention she gave me? What’s the proper way of handling this? And I feel like girls do this all of the time to the extent they can be purposefully harsh or hurtful towards me. Does being friendly with girls always entail getting romantic with them?
"
752,Taking my medication every other day instead of everyday,"What could be the worst consequence of taking Loxx 60mg every other day instead of taking it every day? Honestly, I'm just continuing to take it to avoid withdrawal symptoms. My last checkup was last September. It was my fault for not scheduling follow-up checkups. Sometimes, I try to stop taking Loxx for 2-3 days but withdrawal symptoms start to kick in so bad that I always decide to continue. Due to financial constraints, I can only afford to take it every other day.

I've already scheduled a follow-up checkup, although there's no specific date yet. I'm just preparing myself because I might be reprimanded severely for the way I've been taking the medication."
753,I ruined my life  ,"Hi, I didn't know where to go, and I needed somewhere to vent this is a trow a way account I don't know if that the right way to write it, this isn't my first lenguaje anyway I just turned 24, and my life after highschool is a completly mess and a lie, before university I got a lot of diplomas and was in a constant state of learning and training with new stuff, I had good grades and they even give me a scholarship for keeping the good work but after that part of my life ended I just went downhill and I just don't feel I can't get up, I started an engineer but deam they really kick you hard when your math and physics skills aren't up to date I really tried studying and preparing my self but after countless failed attemps to approve subjects, I just give up ñ, I keep pretending I was trying or lying to myself that I will do best next time but next time never came, and before I knew it I developed some kind of phobia to studying or even trying to go and present an exam, and now I'm stuck in a constant lie to all my circle, all are having high expectations on me because all of the previous achievements in my past but I'm nowhere near that I just can't lie anymore I cry myself till I'm exhausted so I can sleep, I'm a fraud, friends and family ask me how I'm doing with things and I just lie to them that everything is going great but that's not the reallity it's just me pretending so people don't look down on me.... I got used to lie to them but now I have a partner and she is wonderful but she already has a degree and is currently working and seeing I can't be with the same time as her in her life is really hurting me, even more lying to her that I'm doing good with my grades... I'm thinking of ending the relationship Even if it is the best thing that happened to me, but I won't be dragging her in to my bad decision's I do hope she can found someone who can go at the same time as her and makes her happy, sorry if it was too long but if you read all this rant, you have my thanks and I really hope you are doing well even if it sounds ironic I do hope you can use my favorite phrase ""De nada sirve llorar por leche ya derramada"" (It's no use crying over spilled milk)  and keep moving on"

I’m a terrible person, I ruin everything around me, I have no skills, nothing good that I bring to the table and I’m a complete and utter failure. No one should like me honestly, I don’t get why people want to be friends with me. I’ve told them I’m a terrible and worthless person but they ignore the warning. I know im also going to die alone, im not attractive to either gender (I’m bisexual) and I don’t blame anyone for not wanting to be my partner. I blame myself for everything I’ve done wrong, no one else is to blame it’s just me, I’ve ruined my life and I don’t deserve anyone who is in my life.

What will make them happy?"
763,I’m so fucking lonely,"Ive tried a couple times to get in a relationship but it’s so fucking hard to go up to people and talk to them and it’s killing me i’m lucky to have some good friends but that’s not the same as a girlfriend you know, and I’ve been depressed for a while and I’m on antidepressants but they can only do so much and I just want to hug someone who loves me but that’s so out of reach all the people I’m interested in are not close enough to me and I can’t make friends they just show up and I don’t have a attractive personality I get I lot of friends that I wouldn’t hang out with but I’ll say hey to but it’s never women because it’s not like that and sometimes I make some sort of progress towards anybody and something happens this one girl that I managed to get into her friend group with my friends and she invited us over to her house to watch a movie and she invited some other dude who is her ex that’s she’s trying to get back together with and he has a girlfriend he’s chill it’s not his fault but she tried to give him hints like she talked about how she was lonely and single and it just hurt cause I’m sitting here watching the closest I’ve ever gotten to a girlfriend try to flirting with someone else and it’s even worse because she’s not conventionally pretty but I like her and she has a odd personality like me but she just doesn’t even think about me like that I thought I was getting somewhere because she was being nicer to me than normal but it all just fell apart and I know exactly what to do I can give anybody perfect relationship advice for whatever situation your in but I can’t take my own advice because I’m to much of a fucking wimp and can’t handle going up to people and talking I’m not scared of rejection I’m to scared to talk and this hurts me I’m sad already and then I have to deal with this all I need is someone I can love and hug and cuddle it would make me so happy but instead I’m venting on fucking Reddit because I can’t to shit about what situation I’m in I’ve thought about suicide but I can’t be such an asshole and ruin the lives of my friends and family even though a sometimes I feel like they would want me gone and how much better it would be for them the two main reasons though are my best friend we are so close to each other and will never not be each others friends type deal he’s moved away a bunch but we still managed to stay just as close and the second reason is my cat who lives me  so much and I love her and she kinda hates anybody else so I couldn’t imagine her having to live without me she gets stressed when I go on vacations so if I never came back it would ruin her back to my point I don’t try to get with anybody outside of school though instead and play on my Xbox alone and sometimes with friends and outside of that the only other thing I do is go to the gym and I’ve gotten kinda shredded which I hoped would help attract people to me but it hasn’t worked at all I just have told people my bench and gotten impressed looks but it’s not helped at all maybe someone likes me and are in the same situation I’m in but I guess I’ll never know.

764,Anxiety or something else?,"Hi! It’ll be long I’m sorry.
So it all started with my Grandpa getting a brain tumor diagnosis after a stroke. I had the worst panic attack of my life after that, derealization stuck woth me since. Four days after i had a very bad tension headache, it lasted for about a week. Now there’s only pressure behind my nose and eyes, sometimes i feel sharp pain on the side of my head, but not that bad. After the headache got better i started to feel my ear is full, doctor said nothings wrong with it, but it’s ringing sometimes, especially when it’s quiet around me. I can’t function without my headphones or i’ll panic from every noise i hear, it’s like a bucket is on my head. I felt extremely dizzy, and had a blurred vision, which got better sometimes and then worse again. My symptoms got a little better, went for a walk with my boyfriend, than next day i got high fever and a bad flue. The last three days i didn’t eat much, so maybe that’s the cause, but the dizziness became worse. My legs are weak, i literally can’t walk, can’t make myself stand straight. I know the flue didn’t help, but i don’t know if that’s the tumor developing or my mind playing with me. Neurologist sent me to MR, but said i don’t have any symptoms in eyes or reflexes so probably anxiety. Help, i’m going crazy till the scan. It feels like im dying."
765,i have not stopped drinking in 5 days,"i cant be sober

i cant think straight when i am so why be sober and have bad thoughts 

its 330 am i fell asleep at 7pm first thing i did when i woke up is grab a beer

because i cant stop thinking

i cant stop thinking about her 

why isnt she here"
766,Years ago...,"Years ago, it was my plan to end things here. It's my 25th birthday that was my limit. I won't say I feel better or worse, just empty. I wouldn't particular say I've won and it's over but also, I haven't lost. I'm still here. Even when i planned to tell someone about today, i couldn't or more, I wasn't able to do it. Anyway, I'm still here. I guess that's all that matters, at least for now. I might actually became a little more toxic, because of the recent events of my life, but fuck it and the people around me. These fuckers won't deserve me anyway, dead or alive. So well than, I should make myself a nice day I guess."
767,Health issues,"English is not my first language so bear with me here please.

My age is 20 now, I have health issues. When I was born, I have a rare condition on both of my arm which is called Radiolnar Synostosis. I didn't know that until I'm like age 7. Doctors said that they can't do operation because it is harmful and the bone will grow back as it was. I can't twist my arm and I got bullied alot, even in some of my family. I'm having trouble on writing, grabbing, climbing, almost all of activities that uses my arms. And then in 2019, I was having an immense pain on my lower back. When I went to a hospital, not a single doctor knows why. But on my xray I have a little bit of scoliosis but nothing harmful they said. I can't sleep everyday, literally. Everyday is always pain. It is not like something hitting you with a knife but the pain is more like an always eletric shock every second. When I lie down I still have that pain, as I'm writing this, I'm still having pain on my lower back. I can't control it. I feel like I need to always walk for it to become less pain. if I stop, it becomes worse. I did everything. I went to physiotherapy, I did exercise that is for Sciatica issues, doing it for years. My studies reputation went down because of this. I have soo much dream in my life. I was doing fine when this pain didn't struck me yet. When school, I always absent every week, like only 2 days I went to shool Everyweek. Teachers were insulting me because always absent even though I stated my problems and I was having good grades. Now I'm here, 5 years of my life, having this immense pain that I couldn't stop. I'm on University right now but I failed soo many exams. I tried. Now I feel like wanting to suicide. I tell my close friends and other loved ones about this issue. But they didn't seem to care. This life is soo unfair. I born into this world just to feel pain everyday. When I look into other people's life, I feel sad because I can't be normal like them. I don't feel happiness. Even if I did, it is just for a couple of minutes of happiness. I can't write properly, I can't drive cars comfortably, I can't do anything. I dreamed everything when I was a kid. Now, I just always wish something to happen for me to end this suffering. I just want people out there who is having a good healthy life, please, adore it."
768,My Imotions,"Thay need me to listen their words, thay told me about their sad and good moments but thay don't listen my words my sad moments.

Thay just need my service, I felt iam disconnecting from my life, from this world.

I feline iam a burden to every one including my self."
769,It's so hard being depressed in university ,"I dont even have time to digest how im feeling because something is always happening. Like every time i miss a class cuz i didnt feel like showing up to people, i feel guilty. Every time i have an assignment due, i cant do it bc i dont feel prepared enough and it makes me feel guilty. I have so much work to do that i cannot get a break to understand my feelings. Yet my feelings are what is making me stuck in this position. Feeling not ready enough and isolated. And no one talks about this. Everyone in university seems content but i know we're all struggling and i wish i had people to talk about this with. "
770,It keeps getting worse,"No matter what I do, I cant stop the thoughts. I'm so paranoid all the time, my medication doesnt work, my thoughts are just all to much. I can never think about the good times, because I've just had so many bad times. Why wont anyone listen to my calls for help. I just wanna paint my wall red. Im so hopeless, and worthless, I can get over this stump, I've been stuck in for 6 years. Im 19, but Its just a neverending hell. I cant save myself"
771,19 year old. Life is super hard and I’m not good at it,"Hello, I’m 19 from Oklahoma. I’m currently going to UCO in Edmond. I’ve struggled with depression for a good couple years now with decent success in managing it up until recently. I tend to not sleep at night, I lack drive to finish things I start. I feel pretty hollow most of the time and I don’t really understand why. Just thought I’d post and see what you guys have to say. Thanks in advance 👍🏻"
772,I know it won't find anyone,"20f, just...what the fuck is wrong with me? I'm struggling to a point where I'm normalizing it. I'm so incredibly depressed due to my situation to the point where I'm so anxious I can't even sleep at night worried about waking up on time and I am unable to call in sick about this when it happens and I end up In a minutes Ling trance where I just keep repeating something like ""it doesn't matter if I crash because I'm so tired, if I don't fo to work I don't have a job and I dont have a life without a job"" it's been so awful lately and I'm seriously thinking something is wrong with my head and I don't know what to do"
773,Personal help,"I'm tired, but it's not from exhaustion, it's tiredness from being alive.
I feel numb and depressed.
I asked my school counsellor is it was depression, but she laughed it off and said depression was about feeling sad.
My dog is acting strange, and my exams are near, and I just want to cry from exhaustion. 
Someone help, I feel like I'm drowning, but I can see the others breathing.
Help. Please.
I can't laugh, cry, feel anything! 
I'm tired. 
Help. Please"
774,I thought about dying ,Today when I was going in the car and walking out of work all I wanted was to be hit by a vehicle. I don’t want to die but I want appa and amma to feel bad for me at least in this way. I wish they understand me because all I care about is them. If I put myself first I wouldn’t be having these thoughts. Maybe by liking someone I am selfish true I chose my own happiness over others. But I would let it go too and pretend to live a good life when I’m actually drowning. That’s how I think
775,KMS,"I have finally made up my mind, ill be kms on the 29th. I no longer have any reason to stay. Finally I can do it without having the feeling of guilt. 

Now the only thing left is what method should I use, I sincerely dont want to live anymore. 

Fuckin hate being alive."
776,Why do I care so much when a friend ignores me,"I mean I haven’t known this person for long but I did open up to them about the pain i’ve been threw in my life and my struggle with choosing to stay alive everyday. Normally I wouldn’t open up to people i barely know this easily but i can see that he was going threw a lot, trying to deal with everything in his own and i thought it would help if he knew he had someone to lean on. Honestly he’s doesn’t treat people around him well especially me he alway look down on me and women in general he has a questionable moral and belief, he alway say i’m stupid when i share my opinion or make fun of the things i love my hobbies too. What he did made me extremely defensive i alway felt like i was alway walking on egg shells around him and felt like i constantly had to fight which led to me saying or doing mean things i regret to him which i apologise for. I should have cut him out but every one of my friend was friends with hin and seem to ignore all the horrible things he say. I shouldn’t care i should be glad he one day all of sudden stop talking to me or would only ever spit out cold words as if i was nothing  but it hurts so much i think i’m blaming myself for this. The worse part about this is that my best friend sort of defend this person they seem close since they have a lot in common they been talking a lot  she seem to care about his feelings and wellbeing more than me everyone seem things i’m okay with all of this. I feel like everything my fault that i’m the problem i’m the one causing the awkwardness in are group. This is driving me insane and it’s mentally killing me. I’m the horrible person aren’t I everything my fault. "
777,i give up,"at least twice a month my friends and i have arguments and theyre 100% my fault. i keep ruining everything i touch i cant take it anymore i don't know what the fuck to do anymore. i tried apologizing and they accepted but i already know we're gonna end up in an argument again. my other friend also hates me (i think) because of politics.

i just dont know what to do with myself anymore. i feel like a failure. i wish i didnt feel like this, and i fucking hate it, dealing with it since i was around 10.

i also have a feeling that my parents hate me too.

im sorry for posting i just want to rant"
778,How do you know when you need to get help / see a doctor?,"I have been feeling off for over a year now for the following symptoms low motivation, crying several times daily, disinterest in gardening which has been my hobby for many years, general malaise, issues at work, extremely negative self talk, thoughts of death (not suicide, just generally feeling like death would be something of a relief), and weight gain. I went to my doctors last September to discuss options, he suggested we run blood work and get a sleep study. My bloodwork came back saying I have low Testosterone, vitamin D & B-12 deficient. I have been on testosterone replacement therapy since October 2023 as well as vitamins. I was also diagnosed after the sleep study with severe sleep apnea. I have been using my CPAP since middle of December 2023. I had hoped that doing all of that would have made me feel better, and in a way, I do feel better. But in my mind, I still have all of the symptoms that I have that I mentioned earlier. I'm still able to work, even though I am struggling at it. How do you know when you should go and get some additional help? Thank you."
779,I don't have much to keep me going.,"I've been having a shit time for the last 10 years. I've given up on thinking good things are ever going to happen to me. I've lost all hope and faith. I've never felt loved, never been intimate. Ugly, untouchable and now I'm crippled. Now I was doing okay last year, started making some real changes and actually had a fairly happy last 9 months, however I Suffered a stroke a month ago and now I'm completely unable to have any sort of independence. I'm back home living with some incredibly overbearing parents that talk to me like I'm a little retard kid. Nobody has my back. I'm alone, crippled, ugly, misunderstood by everyone and tired. This stroke should've killed me. I'm done thinking good things will come to me. Fuck."
780,not going to school anymore,"i havent gone to school in a couple weeks, i just cant find the motivation to go, it is the one place that gives me the most anxiety and i know there are going to be consequences but i still cant find motivation to go, having to interact with people having to get my grades back up when im failing and just always worried about what other people are thinking of me i need help, ive also been getting blackout drunk almost every day and i know its doing harm to me but it makes me feel alot better how do i start pulling my life together without it feeling forced"
781,Hitting rock bottom,"I feel like I can’t pull myself out of this episode. I have a delayed grief reaction to my grandma passing away on Christmas. And I just think about how lonely my life is in general. I have constant crying spells and I’ve been missing work a lot. I have people I like to call my friends. Even if I can sense that they’re not doing well, I check up on them. Sometimes they acknowledge it immediately and sometimes they don’t for days/weeks. And it just hit me last night that they all know how close I was with my grandma and none of them have even sent a “how are you?” text after she passed away. This has always been how friendships have been, and relationships too. I always invest the kind of love I want from people and I get treated as if I’m insignificant in return. I feel like I’ve hit rock bottom with depression, grief, and loneliness. I have been posting thinly veiled cries for help online and still nobody in my circle has checked on me. I finally got one friend to message me back but they’re only talking about themself. And they bragged about how they spent the night with their friend who was having a rough time. Idk, I feel so terrible."
782,"You also hide your depression and suicidal thoughts from other people by constantly talking about all the good things that happen to you, which is supposed to make you happy, although in fact it doesn't.",everything is written in the title
783,I wish I was as kind to myself like I am with strangers.,"Title pretty much is self explanatory; 

But honestly why am I so harsh on myself? 
Why do I have THE BEST advice for everyone but me?
Why can’t I swallow hard truths.
Say no.
Be gentle with my own soul.


"
784,I want motivation and I want to know why I never have any,"It would solve so many of my problems.  I could finish college.  I could start working and saving money to get the apartment my bestfriend and I talk about all the time. 

I hate the word “lazy” but it’s all I think of and all I hear when I try to explain the depression I’m in.  

I just want my room to be clean. “Then clean it.”

I want to be healthy and fit.  “Then go to the gym. Stop eating fast meals.” 

I want to be beautiful. “Then take care of yourself, get a routine.” 

I feel like I literally can’t. I am 20 years old, I know so many stories of people being well and independent by now but I feel so stuck.  I am 100% convinced (or rather, hopeful) that I just have some sort of undiagnosed issue that is at fault for all of my struggling.  I just want to blame something for my failure and I don’t want it to be me.  


For the last two years I’ve been a high school graduate and I’ve done next to nothing with my life.  Sure I’m enrolled in school, but I’m like four months behind.  Because I’m signed up online and progression is entirely reliant on me being able to give a fuck.  Usually I spend my time just waiting til I can sleep, playing stupid video games that won’t matter if I plan on finishing my shampoo and conditioner at the same time.  

I just want to know what’s wrong with me "
785,Any help would be appreciated,"Hey, How are you? I’m looking to speak to someone who is experiencing health issues or any problems to understand their challenges for a project I’m working on. Would you mind if I asked you a few questions? It won’t take more than 10 minutes."
786,I can’t stop thinking of ending my life,It’s the only thought that has been in my head for the past 5-6 months im so tired I wish that I was never born. I cant even cry my eyes out
787,I feel like I should check myself in somewhere,"Like I should go to the ER or something. I was doing so well that my suicidal ideation actually went away for the first time since I was an adolescent. 

But in the past year, my father in law has died after a slow, agonizing battle with cancer. 3 months later my boss was unexpectedly killed in a motorcycle accident. My beloved grandmother just died two weeks ago. My new boss and his little work wife have been making my life a living hell because I stood up to her when she started bullying another coworker. My boss won't stop fucking with me, and my employer just doesn't seem to give a fuck that he's literally destroying my career and making want to fucking die. I can't fucking take it anymore. I try to use my PTO to avoid my boss because he fucks with me at literally every opportunity. I don't want to quit because I have a great career. I applied for a transfer but they're dragging their feet. 

And to top that off, one of my coworkers stole my wallet on Sunday. I have a GPS tracker in it, can see which truck left my workplace at the same time my wallet did. My old bosses and grandmother's funeral memento cards are in my wallet, and I want them back. That's all I care about. I've filed a police report and I know I need to inform HR but I just CCd them on an email where I was begging my bosses boss to transfer me and stop delaying and I'm honestly humiliated. 

I just want to stop existing. I feel like the stress is literally killing me. All I want to do is do my job and come home. And have just one baby with my husband. I've been struggling with infertility for years and it's absolutely pointless to continue fertility treatments while I'm under so much stress and I'm losing precious time. I can't take it anymore. I have always been extremely reluctant to admit I'm in this state of mind because I was involuntarily committed when I was 14 and it was kinda traumatic. But I really feel like I can't take anymore. I'm an anxious wreck, especially at work. My boss can be physically intimidating. He threatens to write me up over stupid shit constantly. My employer does N O T H I N G.

Can't

788,life doesn't gdt better so what should i do,"i want to try suicide but i don't have a gun, and since i'm poor i can't buy one. what should i do? other methods don't seem as successful"
789,I feel like my mental health is negatively affecting my Girlfriend.,"Hello i am 21 years old and i have severe anxiety/depression, i attempted on taking my life earlier this month on the 6th of Feb (i've gotten the help i needed im doing good) and gradually,  i feel like everything that i say negatively impacts my partner in some aspect. she already deals with a lot on her mind but we both do our part as partners to be there for each other and to help one another as so far it has been working really well, we're both happy to extent until we feel shitty.

The one thing that worries me a lot is that ever since i started venting and talking to her about my problems regarding my self she would listen and do her best for me. but she neglects the idea of ever telling me about her problems which is crucial due how she deals with her own problems she feels like talking to me would only add more to my plate but in reality its never been in issue. through our discussions not only did it help her out it also made me find better solutions  and to see things in a different perspective not only to better myself but our relationship overall. , she thinks about self harm quite often and its scary, yeah i know who am i to talk i almost killed myself a while back but everyday i regret making the decision to end my life.

i just wish she wouldn't shut me out. i feel worried :(

( i forgot to add that she wants me to tell her my problems, so im being transparent and honest with what I've been feeling)"
790,Slipping back into a Depressive episode and I have no idea how to get out of it.,"Hey everyone. I really need advice.

I am on two antidepressants (one also treats my OCD) and an anxiety medication(also for OCD$, so before you suggest getting my meds changed I find that my current blend works well for me. But it isn’t bullet proof, I know medicine isn’t a one stop shop to cured depression.

I am slipping into a depressive episode. My cat got cancer, the one creature that’s ever loved me unconditionally, and it’s all been downhill for me.

I feel it. I know it. I’m neglecting school work and important things to do useless hobbies I don’t even care about. I’m only kept alive by the useless obsessions and compulsions my useless brain makes me do, and sometimes I’m too miserable to even do my compulsions, worsening my anxiety and worsening my OCD symptoms.

I can’t go to class because I can’t focus. Going to my lectures are literally useless at the moment and I’m so behind. Im dragging down my class teammates and I can’t even bring myself to explain to them what’s happening.

I’m sleeping too much or too little. I just feel so hollow.

How do I even start to unbury myself from this hole? I have the desire to do something about it but not the motivation.

I need advice about stuff I can do myself. How do I start? Is it worth it? 

Thanks everyone."
791,Why i hate my family.,"Growing up, ive never had any siblings, which gave me every responsibility in the house starting at age 7. They trained me to be responsible and be obedient. Which is a very good parenting strategy if it wasnt for one thing..

My mother was very close towards her siblings therefore they always hangout, and so does me and my causins. 𝕀 𝔽𝕌ℂ𝕂𝕀ℕ𝔾 ℍ𝔸𝕋𝔼 𝕄𝕐 ℂ𝔸𝕌𝕊𝕀ℕ𝕊. Why? Well because there very fucked up, and I knew that SINCE I WAS 8!!!! 

My causins would do really fucked up shit for fun, like trying to drown me, killing any animal i got as a pet, and more shit that basically developed to physical harm. And the worst part is, the older causins 𝔼𝕏ℙ𝔼ℂ𝕋𝕊 𝕄𝔼 𝔻𝕆 𝔸𝕃𝕃 𝕋ℍ𝔼 𝔽𝕌ℂ𝕂𝕀ℕ𝔾 𝕎𝕆ℝ𝕂 𝔽𝕆ℝ 𝕋ℍ𝔼𝕄!!!! Or they join the others in doing violent shit.

Now that my mother is dead and my father is hospitalized, I now carry the responsiblity of taking care of myself at the age of 13. But even then, my causins will still come over to ""comfort"" me, they say...

And the shit that annoys me is that Dickhead either; 
1. Dont believe me. 
2.Tells me ""Its not that hard""
3.says that im using it as an excuse.

im currently 14 yrs old, Still strugling with financial, accademic, A broken family, A family i wished never existed, and way more shit that most people my age shouldnt even be handling.

And for those who say ""Why didnt you tell your aunties?"" Well its because they naver believe me. ""Why didnt you fight back?"" Its that easy.."
792,People don't actually care if you're okay,"They only ask if you're okay to know if they want to spend time with you or not. They only care if you're okay enough to make them feel good when in your company or talking to you. Once they feel you're not okay, they will move on to other people. 

I've experienced it many times, just today at a gathering, my friend asked me if I was okay or not, once they found out I wasn't they moved away to other people who they could have fun with and feel happy with, which I understand to a degree cos it's human nature to be around people who are happy and laughing, but it's kinda bullshit how people fake concern only to see if you're worth talking to or spending time with. This is a friend whom I've helped during the toughest times and actually feel a lot for. It kinda hurt me when they did that but then I also felt guilty that I probably ruined their mood that they had to move away from me. 

At the end, Im only worth what I provide to people, if I can't provide anything, Im could rot under the sun, and no one would give a fuck. Im not great with words so I don't know if I expressed myself clearly what I was feeling but yeah..."
793,Our world is fucking doomed,I don’t wanna live here. Years feel no different than months. Why live in a world where genocide and colonization is happening as we speak?
794,Please shame me,"So this is gonna be a list of the things my boyfriend has done to me. If you can, please shame me for allowing somebody to do this to me. So I can get the willpower to leave this relationship. I’m so emotionally attached and I can’t let go. Even though I know it’s not healthy for me (and him). I seriously love him, but I don’t wanna live like this anymore. 

1. Has physically shoved me to the ground, or kicked me off of the bed.
2. Has thrown food at me when he’s gotten really mad.
3. Poured liquor down my purse, ruining everything inside.
4. Has scared me before.
5. Doesn’t know how to regulate his anger. 
6. Takes things out on me, only verbally/emotionally 
7. Makes a tinder for attention. I was complementing him enough. So it’s just to “boost his ego” (his words). He wasn’t talking to anymore. 
8. Has slammed my phone at the wall a few times.
9. Has told me details about his past sex life/partners. Even after I asked him to stop bc it made me uncomfortable.
10. Has shown me pictures of girls that he could fuck if he really wanted to. 
11. Has made comments about my weight. 
12. Tell me to stop talking whenever I get too excited about anything.
13. I always drive us around. 
14. I always drive to his place. It’s a 13 minute drive. But he never comes over to my place.
15. I pay for everything.
16. He owes me. $600+ 
17. He can afford a bottle of rum every 1-3 day. But can’t afford $7 flowers.
18. Has broken my stuff before.
19. Has stood me up for hours before.
20. Just throws me out the door of his apartment.
21. Has thrown my things out of his apartment.
22. It’s just always angry. Period
23. Wants to move in together, but doesn’t even want to add me on social media.
24. Tells me if I was a guy, he would fuck me up.
25. tells me I am victimizing myself when I start crying.

Small details: We’ve been together for a little over a year now. He’ll be 38 this summer. And I just turned 27. It’s not always like this. He has OCD and BPD, Still new to him. I do have ADHD, but I’ve learned how to cope with it(I still have my days though). I really do know he loves me. In his own way. I’m his good days, he’s literally perfect. On his low days, it’s a different person. 

And trust me, I know what you’re thinking. To whoever is reading this. I just needed somewhere to put my thoughts. I don’t think I’ll ever experience a human being like him ever again. he is absolutely the love of my life and my soulmate. And I have nothing but love for him. When I look into his eyes, I honestly see his hurt/scared inner child. The amount of things this man has endured his whole entire life, breaks my heart. And I will be forever sorry for any pain I have caused him. "
795,The cruelest trick of nature was allowing humans to feel no care even for themselves,"Apathy drove me to commit many mistakes and failures to act on choices that matter that I’ll regret forever. Ignoring someone who tried to help me, letting a toxic partner stay in my life, hell even just sleeping on time. 

And at the root of it all is the fact that I can bring myself to care about me. Food, sleep, self improvement in general. I can’t be nice to me, I can’t be mean to me. The way I feel seems unchangable, and the way I act feels written in stone.

I’m 19 now, and for the first time I’ve found a friend who cares about me genuinely. And yet I’m caught driving our relationship to madness because i force them to watch me spiral. 

I’ve learned that It’s impossible to have someone in your life who cares for you, and simultaneously do nothing to fix your own problems. 

And yet on the other hand I can’t fix myself for them because that sort of improvement wouldn’t  be real. Hell, I’m not even sure if I could with that motivation.

And yet at the bottom of it all im not even capable of being a selfless human being, maybe if I can’t care about myself, I can care about others; but that’s not true, because the only thing I seem to care about in relation to me is TRAUMA. 

My trauma with men, with fears of abandonment, with jealousy, with cheating, with disappointment. The only things I clutch dear to my pain stricken heart are toxic learned habits that do nothing but make it impossible to trust others or find happiness. But the simultaneous apathy would be entirely fine with never sleeping.

Put it in perspective, I’d rather starve and be exhausted if it meant having a partner who would never cheat than have to deal with another cheater and be physically healthy.

What a cruel and horrible world to allow for a sentient being the desire to destroy itself on a crusade against demons it had never had a choice inviting into its life. I feel defective, like I took a fall like everyone else but mine hit an integral part of my programming. 

I’m tired of me, I’m tired of being broken, but I’m too tired to even do anything about it"
796,Zero motivation and i just hate myself for it,"I have zero motivation for anything at this point. Ive gotten so lazy to the point that i dont even feel like lifting a single finger anymore. I just want to rot in my bed 24/7 until i die. Everyone my age (16) are having so much fun yet i seem to be the only one who is just left out. Why is it that others get the good things while i always get burning dogshite?? I hate everything about myself too to be honest. Nothing i like if myself. Im short, im extremely fucking stupid, i have zero friends and the only people who are talking to me are only talking out of pity, my grades are horrible and im barely passing, im horrible with looks too. Im a disgrace to my dipshit-filled family and atp maybe offing myself is the best choice. I have no future and im so sure that i'll be dead by the time i graduate highschool or something. Nothing is just worth living at this point knowing damn well that im gonna end up on the streets. 

Why must i be a laughingstock while everyone else has the best lifes???"
797,I don't think I want help,"I'm failing college, and stuck with a shitty job. I can hardly afford food. My car is breaking down. I'm at my fucking wits end.

I met someone who changed my life for a while. She held me together. And I fucked it up by saying I loved her. She cut me off because I couldn't keep my mouth shut.

I have nobody else. I cut my toxic family off and I have no friends.

I don't want help because I want to get worse. To the point where I have no other choice but ending my life."
798,Today I woke up and smiled when I realised I was alive,"This comes as a huge surprise to me. Exactly a year ago today was the last day of an extremely violent and bloody self-harm streak that lasted 9 days. 

Just over 5 months ago, my friends, my very foundation who had dragged me through my earlier episodes ditched me, made me feel unloveable, and made up lies about me.

I thought that was it. I cried 4 minutes into this year, knowing I physically couldn’t go through all that again, sobbing in fear of what I would do to myself if everything went wrong again.

But so far, it hasn’t. I’ve made new friends. I’m a little over two months clean. Life, as it stands, is pretty good.

Don’t get me wrong, I still get suicidal thoughts and urges to self harm, and I’m still incredibly insecure about my scars. But I think I can deal with it. You can too.

I made this post realising that a lot of people here feel like I did this time last year. Hopeless, worthless, lost.

I hate to repeat the same overstated cliches but there is genuinely light at the end of the tunnel. You have people- friends, coworkers, family members, who love you more than you could ever understand. Your presence means so much to them. 

And still, understandably, if you feel like that isn’t the truth, reach out to someone. Anyone. I get that I’m just some internet stranger but I hope that someone can be someone to you.

Here’s to hoping your lives turn around soon 🥂 "
799,... ,"I feel like I can't talk to anyone. No one cares, and when you apparently reach 21 years old your suppose to magically be okay and not have things like depression or anxiety or ptsd from an abusive alcohol mother.
So there must be something wrong with me. Even at 35 I still think about suicide."
800,lonely but not alone,"i (22m) never post things like this online but its late at night and my mind won’t stop. 

for about 2 years now i’ve been experiencing some hard hitting depressive moments, usually stemming from issues i have with my ultra conservative/christian family—more specifically my ex-pastor father. along with that, I also work night shifts in the health industry and it takes so much out of me with little to no satisfaction. 

My job is mostly solo work keeping me tied to a singular room without windows and little interactions with anyone my age/who’s not my immediate coworkers for 10-12 hr at a time. No amount of music or videos could distract me from spiraling hard every night.

Ive been living with my partner (29m) for a little less than a year + together for a yr 1/2 and my time with him has been amazing and i cant ask for a better partner, but I cant help but feel so much guilt coming home to him every morning feeling nothing but a void in my chest. Leaving to go to work is even worse, by then Im completely devoid of emotion or motivation and i cant even give him a proper reason why. im just not happy with anything or anyone when i feel that pressure in my head and just replay memories, thoughts, things ive should have said or done in my head. 

I have no friends, besides a conversation here and there with an old friend that has everything but the time and day for me and i dont blame them. I’m a loser. ive never beenextroverted, i didnt make it into any universities so i was forced to make the decision to stay with my parents through the entirety of what wouldve been my college years. Covid, on top of that, shifted my entire state college academic career online leading to even less human interactions i can get in a day. I lost all my friends, presence on social media and desire to continue my education.

Because of my job i havent been able to fully complete an entire semester of something i never wanted to do in the first place. Ive dropped out of more classes than Ive completed in the last year. I feel burnt out and choked up. its never enough for me and no matter how i frame my situation I feel like a failure and having a partner in the middle of it just makes me feel like im wasting their time and energy to console me but i dont know what to do.

im in pain after every shift, im constantly breaking out, restless at night, and overall numb and uninterested in everything. even if i try to pick up a hobby it leads absolutely no where.

time is my enemy. minutes, hours and days pass by me like nothing. Video games bore me after 20 mins, i hate watching tv or movies because i feel like im losing time when i could be doing something more useful whatever that may be. i never got to experience life free from anyone or without worrying about losing someone. I hate saying it but i wish i was alone so no one would care what i did.

im afraid all of these things im feeling is gonna result in me cracking. ive already accepted that im probably not gonna graduate and filled to drop out. 

I don’t know what to feel. Guilt? Anger? Satisfaction? I can’t help but feel selfish when i hear someone say how lucky i am or how grateful i should feel because i just dont.

801,I’m genuinely trying to be better but I’m really tired.,"I feel so pathetically lonely and I want to just feel wanted, even if it means being dead and finally feeling important.

804,Have Citalopram lost its effect? Switch to different SSRI?,"ER doc and new father since 7 months here. Been on Citalopram 40mg for a long time. Initially got it after consequences of several concussions/mild traumatic brain injury 15 years ago. Eventually went off it and later had a burnout with much insomnia, anxiety, dizziness, brain fog, lack of energy and likely depression. 

Went back on Citalopram, then switched to Mirtazapin. Felt absolutely awful until we added back Citalopram in combination. Reduced my depression score by half over just a few weeks and then slowly improved from the burnout(but suffered side effects so went off Mirtazapin after a year and continued Citalopram). 

After a few years of getting back to normal and now 3 years work as a ER physician I have since 1 year had similar symptoms and been on and off work/sick leave. Me and my psychiatrist chose not to change/add medication but since my rehabilitation is stagnant I feel something needs to happen. Difficult situation with a small child also. 

Currently unsure whether Citalopram has lost effect or if its just not enough. Have noted that side effects such as difficulty reaching orgasm is not as prominent as from what I remember previously. Could this be an indication that it has lost effect and that maybe a different SSRI may be sufficient? Otherwise I will have to restart Mirtazapin combination. 

Thank you for your insights and experiences. "
805,Suicide attempt,Hello i am 14 and i attempted suicide a couple of weeks ago basically i jumped from the 3rd story landing it was very pathetic just like me i didnt loose consciousness i remember the whole fall and i just landed and dropped to the ground i then was trying to stand up but some teachers were holding me down i had a compression fracture on my lower back i fractured both of my heels and i also fractured my pelvis i lost half of an inch of my height aswell.

806,I just want to see my wife and son.. ,"My wife and youngest son are in Georgia. I’m in Spokane. 2500 miles away. I haven’t seen them in 6 months. My plan was to move in two weeks, with taxes to help pay for gas and everything. My ex fucked me on taxes and claimed my oldest son ( I was supposed to claim him this year) so my taxes went from 5.6k to 1.6k. And on top of that the IRS Decided to take 1.3k for an overpayment on unemployment 2 years ago. So I only got back $126. My oldest son’s bday is march 9th so the $60 I have left is going to his bday presents. So now I literally have no money to get there. It really sucks and idk what to do, I’ve already sold off 80% of my stuff. I feel so heart broken and defeated. I just want to see my wife and son :(

810,Why must you disregard concern for others to get support? (Content warning),"Tw: suicide depression self harm etc

Haha

The only people who get comfort from their friends and stuff are the people who actively make everyone around them miserable because they’re always talking about being abused or suicidal and never let anyone else vent and never ask before talking and don’t even care if they’re exposing random people they don’t even care if they trigger people around them they don’t even try but they’re just desperate I guess because for some fucking reason that’s the only way you can get support hahahaha 

To cover your arms in scars to constantly talk about to never ask before venting or traumadumping to never listen for very long to others they say they’re try they say they’re sorry and I guess they probably are but it’s so frustrating bc I can’t let myself do that

It would hurt too many people "
811,One of the harder days,"Im 31m, I have an amazing boyfriend, a beautiful cat, hobbies and friends and yeah.
I feel guilty on days like this, the wave hits I lose energy, my mind wanders and I start thinking about the end of it all and why I should.
It becomes a me vs me situation and it gets unbareable. 
I have recently found myself letting out  invouluntary yelps, for lack of a better word, I keep having the same delusions about everyone hating me.
Been doing AA for a few weeks again after my last relapse. Missed today because I just couldnt leave the house honestly.
Hell i can hardly do that most days without nearly breaking down and crying.
So i just sat around and played Fallout new vegas.
I thought meeting joshua graham again would help. And uh yeah it didnt.
I never used to be like this, I used to be fun.
I used to be cool, now im just this fucking wreck.
Apparently my friend said it the other day ""I look like a shell"".
Fuck i didnt even think about the weight loss until now, its gotten that bad that a guy at aldi asked if I knew where to buy ice (meth).
That hurt, I knew the poor dude was just trying to feed his shit and he was nice enough but fuck man. 
I cant even talk to my boyfriend because it will spiral him and make him feel like shit, like he doesnt do enough.
I cant talk to anybody really, everyone is either sick of my shit or knee deep in theirs.
I dont know what to do besides just buckle up , grit my teeth and hope i dont have a fuck it moment and go get loaded. 
Gone back to playing tf2 so i can relive some kind of nostalgia from when my life wasnt a constant stream of burning shit.
I try to be grateful for what I have, I love who and what iv got but man yeah.
Days like today are the reason why I will never own a gun or have one where I live.
Hell im not even sure if i want to die, I think I just want it to end. 
I just wanted to get that outta my chest"
812,Want to skip to the end,"In four months I (29,M) will graduate from college. At one time that seemed like a huge accomplishment--I was a high school dropout and for a while it looked as though college was not on the cards. I went to trade school, kinda liked it, and got a job that I came to hate. Then I got laid off during covid and decided to give college another shot. Fast forward a few years, and I'm on the cusp of a BA in Business. Well-regarded program, big university, competitive atmosphere...and it feels completely meaningless. I've been trained to spew convincing bullshit, but have no real skills outside rudimentary operations and data analysis. 

When I think about life after college, the bottom of my stomach drops out. There's a clear progression of things I SHOULD do: get an office job that pays ok, move out of my mom's place, save up, maybe travel a bit in whatever vacation time I can scrounge. Fundamentally, though, I know what my next 40 years look like: work, sleep, repeat. I'll be a mid-level spreadsheet jockey somewhere, doing my bit to make some asshole shareholders just that little bit richer.

""So what?"" I can feel you thinking it. ""That's life. Time to grow up. You have your health, you have a decent education, you have no debt and no excuse to whine. Nobody likes working, they do it because they have to pay rent and it funds the things in life that matter. Focus on the people in your life, on your hobbies. Be a man.""

But what if there isn't anything that matters? Hobbies were never really my thing; I used to ski a lot but lately it doesn't do anything for me, just feels mechanical. My social life feels like a set of appointments on a calendar. I go out for drinks or go see a show the same way you might go to the dentist or get a haircut. Talk, drink, laugh, ""This was so much fun, what are you up to next weekend?"" Pretending makes me tired. 

Sometimes I think about how inconsequential we are as people. Everything in the world seems so big and important, but it's all happening on an infinitesimally small rock hurtling through an incomprehensively massive and mostly lifeless void. Before I existed, the universe went on for billions of years, and after I die it will continue for billions more. So what does it matter if my little blip lasts 90 years or 30? If we're all going to the same destination, why not take a more direct route? 

I've considered self-deleting, sometimes seriously, but don't think I could do it. Partly because I'm squeamish, partly because I'm an only child and it would completely destroy my parents. They're good people, I love them dearly, they love me, and leaving them in that level of pain is a pretty despicable idea. 

Maybe I'll get hit by a cement mixer tomorrow. Maybe I'll get cancer. But barring that, it's going to be a while. 

So, reddit, how do I make my time in the waiting room a bit more comfortable?"
813,Who even am I?,"I 29M, am feeling the lowest I have ever felt. I feel like no one's even home in my head anymore. The days keep going by faster and faster. I want to make a plan for my future but I'm too busy flying by the seat of my pants in the current moments. There's no time to stop and think or make decisions.

My mom passed in October, I think I'm still coming to terms with the reality of that. And also realizing that she was the one that tied the family together. With her gone things are different. She's the one who would have made sure they attended my graduation or checked in on me from time to time. I opted not to walk for graduation because I doubt anyone would come.

I had a daughter in September, her mom left with her a couple months ago. I video chat her once in a while. We live four hours apart now and my current schedule and finances don't allow me to go see her very often. When I do see her it only brings more sadness. I want to be there for her firsts, I want to raise her, I want to know here. Last time I saw her she was afraid of me.

I try not to think about it too much, which is probably wrong. But I don't know what else to do, it hurts too much. I tried so hard to make things work, to do well in school to make moving with me worth it for them, fought through the burnout. Only for them to leave. My friends just say 'I told you so"" or ""You should have seen it coming everyone else did'. Why can't I fight through the burnout anymore? My reason to keep going is gone.

Her mom has since tried to apologize and tell me she was wrong and regrets leaving and has hinted at wanting to return, but I really haven't been able to respond to her on those topics. I just can't get back on that roller coaster ride with her. 

Not really sure what I'm posting for, to vent? Hopefully get some of these thoughts out of my head. I don't know. I'm tired.

Tired and angry and sad. That's all I am. I can remember the person I've been before. I can look back through my memories and see how that person gradually got beaten down and destroyed and now, I'm all that's left. Just a sad empty husk. I know the things that once brought me joy. Different activities or hobbies, but it all just feels like more shit now. 

They say it gets better. Life has ups and downs. What's the point when the ups are just a slightly less shitty version of the downs? It doesn't get better, just shittier. Like everything I do to try and better myself leaves me more alone, more miserable, and less alive.

I'm supposed to graduate college in a couple months, but I'm slipping hard. I want to care, I know part of me does care, and that I'll definitely care if I do mess this up. But right now I truly just don't care anymore. The work keeps piling up. My job continues to takeover priority and I'm just in a constant state of absolute burnout.

I can't think straight, can't focus, and I don't know why I even get out of bed. I just sit aimlessly until I can go back to bed. It's like I keep going through phases where my mind just turns off and it feels like five minutes have passed when in reality its been hours and I can't remember doing anything in those times.

I just want to rest. I want time to breathe and to think. I want to not be consumed by stress at all times. I think about death all the time. I don't actually want to die. I want to feel alive. But everyday I feel less so than the last.

I'm sure this will pass and I'll reread this post and delete it just like other times, only to return the next go around when it comes back stronger again.

Right now I really need to power through this schoolwork, but it feels so impossible. I'm not sure what to do. I need therapy."

817,Journal entry 2 pardon if there are grammatical and spelling errors I left my glasses on the dresser.,"Journal entry #2: 	I’m drowning  
Today has just started since it’s two in the morning and my burden of failure has carried over to this hour, of the next day. I feel worse than after the internship interview today. Maybe it’s because I was able to cry after I closed the laptop and release my sorrow, as compared to now, I want to cry but I can’t. Only small trickles will run down ever so slightly and only if I think about cutting my wrists. For some reason, I feel draining my blood will be an easier death than a heart attack. And I think the only reason I cry about it is because I know I’m entering that dark head space again. My head right now aches only slightly, my jaw is clenched, and the light in the room is making my eyes lower than normal. I’m so tired I’m drowning.   
I set my alarm for 9 hours so I could give myself time to fall asleep 30 minutes have gone by rolling in the sheets, covering my head with the forest green comforter, while having my eyes completely open. Watching my heartbeat through my wrist. The rhythm was smooth and faster than normal only slightly did it look irregular and that was when I thought about suicide. The medication does help, I can admit that. In addition, low intensity workouts and lowing my coffee consumption has made a large difference. My chest pains aren’t as frequent, and it is nice. Feels good to say something positive, but also ironic. Ironic that when I feel healthy I want to die, but when I feel god is taking me naturally I beg to live. I’m so tired I’m drowning.   
I have noticed when I can’t control my state of emotion that smoking cannabis doesn’t put me in a sense of panic compared to when I feel fine and in a way almost content. The thought of impending doom never crosses my mind when it’s inhaled on days of hopelessness. Before this sadness the last emotion I felt was irritability and then eventually anger. I didn’t have a particular reason why I was angry, I just remember thinking about violence and internally hyping myself up in fictional scenarios. Ashley and I got into after. Had another conversation about the same old shit but different location. Little does she know that her solution drains me. Drains my energy, my hope, my sense of positive thinking. Everything revolves around her, I could have got an A on an exam and lost 10 pounds or even won $1,000,000 but if were not good nothing is good. It’s been 5.5 years I’m starting to really grasp how dependent I am of her. The thought of her absence makes me ill. If she came close to me right now and hugged me it would be like medicine to this darkness clouding my skull. Yet, this relationship is a double-edged sword. Love is a double-edged sword. She is my sickness, she is my health, she is my drug. I am so tired I’m drowning.   
"
818,How to get over self-hatred?,"I don't know why, but I've always set incredibly high standards for myself. Part of it may have to do with being labelled gifted in early elementary school, which shaped my identity such that everything I did had to be perfect in order to prove to myself and parents that I really was ""gifted"". I know I was insecure as far back as I can remember and always felt like I was missing something compared to other kids. I always felt uncool and struggled to connect with people socially even though I maintained a healthy friend group back then. Being ""smart"" was the only thing that made me feel acceptable.

I always fed off the love of my parents. I remember being afraid to advocate for myself because I didn't want to displease them. It was so bad that I could never say no to even the smallest things and I pretended to be enthusiastic about stuff I really didn't want to do. I don't really understand why I formed this deep sense of insecurity and dependence on the approval/love of my parents/others as I was never bullied or verbally abused. My current theory is that I received *too much* attention from my parents as a baby (my mother was extremely protective) which formed in me such a strong dependence on extrinsic love.

Anyways, for whatever reason I burnt out by the end of middle school and lost the motivation to really engage in academics and sports. I'm still trying to work out why I burnt out so fast, and I know part of it had to do with the heavy workload I received in middle school. Things really went downhill in the beginning of high school when I started receiving poor grades, which really upset my parents and subsequently me. I hated myself so much for the fact that I couldn't muster up the willpower to pay attention in class or do my homework and this exponentially increased the deep insecurity I'd been repressing. Suddenly the only thing I derived self worth from was ripped away from me. I had no idea who I was without my ""being good at school"". It didn't help that my friends were all high achievers which alienated me from them because I felt like I no longer fit in.

There was tons of stupid drama from that point on with self harm, drugs, shitty suicide attempt, mental health treatment, homelessness, etc etc. I'm 20 now, I got sober four months ago and I'm trying to put myself together so I can move on from it all. I've been doing lots of reflecting and have concluded that my deep depression has been a result of a severe lack of self compassion. I'm very ashamed of the narcissism and stupid drama of my adolescence but I also recognize that it was because I didn't know how to love myself.

In spite of this insight into myself, I still hate myself and feel inadequate no matter how much I tell myself I'm worth more than that. I've become acutely aware of this constant self-deprecating voice in my head and I don't know how the fuck to shut it off. It's kind of terrifying how little control I seem to have over the thoughts in my head. No matter how much I tell myself how pointless it is to be insecure, I can't control the constant shame I feel for the most minute, trivial things. In short, I have no idea why the fuck I can't love myself. I have no idea why the fuck I never had self-compassion to begin with and I feel it is the only thing holding me back from living a happy, fulfilling life.

I wrote this more just to organize the thoughts in my head, but I am still in desperate need of advice from people who may have experienced something similar. I mean, I know learning to love yourself is part of the human experience but I feel it's overwhelming how much I dislike myself."

I volunteer, I'll drive the distance to help you or give you sdvice, I'll drive the distance to be a shoulder for you to cry on. I flew out 12 hrs to let someone rant to me and cry about their ex because I knew they'd be happy. it wasn't until recently that I started waking up and realizing I am worrying about everyone else's problems and focused on saving them...I am the type of person who would easily throw my life away and push a fucking grandma walking across the street about to get hit by a car away if it means she lives a bit longer...then I take a look and realize how fucked up I am. that's a fucked up perceptive. I could have everything I want in life but I would easily throw it all away in 30 seconds like that. I realized that these tendencies are becoming more and more qhaf seems to be making me an angrier person and honestly reading that makes it look I'm an alternative form of suicidal but it's not really like that. I took another look and realized the last 4 girls ive been with all had mental issues and I grew accustomed to making sure they were always doing okay and talking to them about their problems but they all left and disregarded it like it was nothing, with one of them cheating the entirety of our relationship . I'm just such a lost person in my life right now and I have video games and anime which really do help me distract myself but as soon as I'm away from them I'm a miserable person. I don't even want to talk to my only 4 friends anymore. I don't want to be around anybody at all anymore and I keep cycling back to saying im fine then the next week I am isolating completely from everybody and it's starting again this week I can feel it. my friends questioned why I don't reach out or talk about it but they just told me that I need to get fucking help. all I want to do is change and be a better person for people and be a happier person but the older I get....the more I feel like sanity or my mind slipping...."
820,"Tell me, is a psych ward really everything I dream it is?","When I'm really doing horribly, I imagine this place where I don't have to explain my mental state, where they flood me with sedating drugs and where no one requires anything of me. If you've been to a psych ward, what is the reality? Would it really help me like I think l it would, or is it a place to avoid at all costs? Any insights would be really helpful."
821,i feel like i'm actually going insane,"
For the last few months i've been spiraling to being a disgusting person and i really don't see myself ever being functional again. 
There's not a single moment in my days where i'm not thinking about either self harming, drinking until i pass out or fantasizing about someone straight up killing me, and it is so fucking tiring. For some reason i got a really bad addiction to imagining myself getting stabbed, and now i can barely stay still when i'm close to a knife.

It is currently 02:35am here and i have to go to work at 07:00, but i simply can't sleep because i don't want ""another day"" to begin, because i know that as soon as i have to leave my house, i will feel like puking.

I also became obsessive towards a person that i barely know, simply because she is polite to me, and it's got to a point where i'm only able to be in a normal mood when i'm thinking about her. She is not a good person either but i simply do not care, in fact it's almost as if because she is bad, she is able to understand what i'm feeling.

I am really, really, REALLY tired of having violent thoughts everyday. At college, work, home, anywhere, my brain is giving me the most gruesome images about my dead body, and it makes me happy in a weird fucked up way

Up until last year i was completely emotionless, i felt nothing towards myself and others, but now i feel like i finally got to my breaking point, and honestly i don't see myself turning back. It's like i completely lost track of who i was or wanted to be, idk.

sorry for the brainstorm, i just want to cry my eyes out but not a single tear comes out, so i had to type it out.

822,Never good enough ,"If I was the man I wanted myself to be, I'd look back and ask why I held myself from becoming him sooner. If I was the man I never wanted myself to be, I'd say look in the mirror, there's nothing to change here. 
Trying to figure out, why this present man answers saying to the first: ""Don't worry I'm headed right towards you"" and to the second: ""Your reflection is all I've ever seen, and nothing I do right changes that""
Leaves the present man wondering what he did so wrong, that in time everything he did right fails, and everything he did wrong flourishes into something worse.
He does good, and is rewarded with evil.
He does evil, and is rewarded with evil.
How will he ever be that man he wants to be when no matter how much he tries saying ""don't worry I'm headed right towards you"" to the good man.
Yet all efforts lead to ""Your reflection is all I've ever seen, and nothing I do right changes that"" to the man he never wanted to be.
Maybe it's time he stops thinking about both.."
823,My Life Is Looking Bleak....Anyone relate?,"I discovered I might have a chronic or (maybe) terminal illness. It is sending me into a downward spiral. Again, every time I try to be happy, God abandons me. It seems like I was born to suffer.  I was abused since a child and when I finally got away from that, I ended up working abusive jobs and homeless for a few years. Then I finally was able to get a place but During pandemic I ended getting taken from a job I actually loved.   I ended up being self employed only to end up in a car accident. For an entire year I hardly had food and was arguing and constantly fighting with my roommate. Then I finally got the mental help I needed (because I was suicidal at that point) only for things to turn on me and now I'm dealing with a physical illness.  Was I not meant to be happy?  Why is my luck so horrible? I look at other people's lives and wonder why that can't be me?  I'm ranting I  guess...maybe looking fir people who relate.  I'm in the hospital as we speak. I came in for simple flu and now it has turned into something else.  I just want to scream. I'm doped up with Xanax to high heaven."
824,I’m emotionally unstable ,I’m a single mom of a beautiful 1 year old I’m battling suicidal thoughts but I’m told constantly if I say something my son will be taken from me and that I’m selfish for wanting to unalive myself…my own mother (NOT BIO IM ADOPTED) told me to do it I feel so alone I have no real friends and no body to talk to I’m on depression meds but I don’t think they are working I wanna be happy and loved so bad 
825,i have everything but im not happy,"I have a history of depression which dates back a couple years ago.

Growing up as the eldest daughter, I always felt alone because of the responsibilities I had. I was a straight-A student up until I got depression my sophomore year of high school. I flunked that year, but I was able to do a complete 180 and did better than ever.

Now, I am at one of the top schools in the world, but I still don't feel enough. I'm never happy. I am always overwhelmed with guilt and shame.

This is my first year of college, and I am not doing well at all. My academics are poor, and I am too stubborn to ask for help (academically and emotionally).

I really want to be put on medication. I cannot ask my parents for it because they felt shameful that they had a depressed daughter. They told me they were embarrassed when they knew I was depressed. I am not blaming my parents; they love me and will do anything for me. But one thing I will never do is ask for emotional help again. The amount of burden I felt was overwhelming.

Ever since I had depression, it never really went away. Sure, I did get significantly better, but even after years it is still present. I have resentment for so many people and I have so much resentment towards myself. Honestly, I wish I was never born.

I always have to be *this* and *that*. I have to marry a specific type of person, I have to be intelligent, I have to be feminine, I must be proper, I must not do *this* and *that*. I am so sick of it. I am sick of being my family's entire image. I am so tired of having my emotions undermined by everyone around me. It is not fair I always help my friends out, both emotionally and academically, but never get it in return.

I am this picture-perfect daughter everyone wants. But I am such a mess in the inside. Words cannot describe how much hate I have for this world. I wish it could end. I wish I did not have this burning sensation in my throat every second of the day because I have to hold back my tears. I hate seeing happy people. I hate it when my family is happy. I hate it when I am happy. I do not believe I deserve to be happy.

I wish I had an older sister. I wish I did not have to be the eldest child in the family. I am expected to help everyone else, but nobody is there for me when I need it. I am just told to toughen up.

I wish I didn't have to feel this way. I have everything. I have my whole life set up. I am guaranteed a high-paying job straight out of college. I am guaranteed to get accepted to a top grad program, too. I have so many connections with the top researchers of the world, so why do I have to feel this way? Why do I have to be so unhappy? I really do not understand why I'm so weak. I am really, really tired."
826,"When it rains, it really fucking pours","Christ, why is it when something goes wrong, everything else does, too?

I (M29) have battled with depression for the last five years. It’s a volatile battle, but I generally get through the dark days and things tend to get easier for a while.

However, recently, it’s really becoming difficult to see my life as anything other than absolutely written off. I’ve lost tens of thousands (70k), and I’m about 20k in debt. House and car have already gone - I’m now renting a shitty place and was driving a shitty car. I say “was”, because that car broke down today and the cost to fix it is way more than it’s worth.

My frustrations are showing at work. It’s causing me to be short with people and causing problems - I suspect I’m going to be laid off in a manner of weeks, at most.  

My life really feels like it’s now over - I don’t really see how I can crawl back from this, and, even if I did over the next decade, what is the point of living through such a grim struggle. I’m not overly scared of the prospect of death, I guess part of me has always hoped that things would get better - or I would make them better. But as the years go by, I’ve just made everything worse. At some point, it becomes sensible to just call it quits "
827,My crush asked me why I'm so quiet and I'm kind of upset about it ,"Don't get me wrong, 9 times out of 10, people don't have any bad intentions when asking that. It's just that when I was younger, if someone asked me that, and my parents overheard, they'd hit me when I got home. But yes, my crush asked me why I was so quiet. I just kind of brushed over it and told him I prefer listening. He then asked me what I like to do for fun. So I told him. 

I don't know. It's not a big deal, really. I just get self conscious that he thinks I'm weird, or creepy, like so many other people in the past."
828,Why,"I am 3 days from turning 28. Lately I haven't been able to get out of my own head. And it's let me down a pretty dark path, I honestly don't know how managed to keep some sort of semblance of a smile on my face, When all I want to do is just crawl in a hole and stay there.  I used to look forward to my birthday Now I just want it to be over I just want everything to be over. "
829,The first time I didn't feel safe with myself,"I needed support yesterday and after being told by my go to person that they didn't have the space for me, I asked four more people. They all rejected me, because of good individual reasons. I think I give people a false sense of security. When they reject me, I brush off how much I need them, I tell them I will find someone else, that it's okay and show them a smile. 

But I was not okay, I have cried non stop for 3 hours. I have imagined myself dying, jumping into the ice cold water and slowly drowning, letting the soft hands of death take me away from the anxities. 

While going home I stayed as far away from the water and the traintracks as I could. I don't want to die, I want to finally live my own life. Be free from the control of my mother. I want to do a big endurance cycling event, I want to lift 100 kilo's, I want to decorate my own home, I want to teach a kid the wonders of life. 

I repeat those things to myself and hope they will always overpower that lurking hopelessness that wants to give up. I did not feel safe, I hope I can regain trust in myself."
830,i live in constant okayness.,"im just okay. happy sometimes. sad sometimes. is this it? im at the point where im not super depressed anymore. but im still not good. maybe i am good and this is just it. i dont know when my expectations on life are too high, or too low. i think im happy with where im at in life."
831,I'm dumb as hell.,"Maybe this sounds stupid, but most of my problems have been caused due to me being very dumb. Always been a class clown, being humiliated by everyone, not being able to get when they were insulting me or how to respond. I would literally say the most stupid things just to make everyone laugh, and I thought they where laughing with me instead of actually laughing at me, like a teacher said, same teacher who called me mentally retarded in front of everyone in the last year of elementary. I went through highschool as the biggest loser and finished it at 19 years old instead of 16, like every normal person due to my lack of intelligence and not getting nothing right, ended up in a sort of a special education class. Whenever I'm with my ""friends"" I get mocked for not understanding something or for being a general loser. Nothing gets better, I'm useless, like everyone else, including family, says. I think my IQ is far lower than average, and on top of that I'm ugly, bald and short, all at 19. 

I'll probably kill myself eventually, there is no use going to a therapist to tell him I'm retarded, that won't change my intelligence and will probably laugh at me like everyone else."
832,Why can't i just be happy? ,"Tldr at the bottom.

I (23m) can't seem to be happy. I have always thought that if i do this and that or change up certain things that i will finally be happy but it doesn't seem to work.

I have a good relations with my friends and family who support me. I am currently together with the girl of my dreams, who is pregnant with our first daugther. And we are currently looking into buying our first house. I have a well paying job that helps other people and keeps me physically and mentally active.

From the outside it would seem like i pretty much have it all but i cant get happy without a direct stimulus if that makes sense. My default state is always beeing depressed about something and if i dont immediately do something to cheer me up it always gets worse and worse. I cant seem to catch a break. 

I just dont know what to do anymore and thought why not ask people on here how they deal with their negative thoughts. I have tried changing my lifestyle to be more healthy, exercising, eating better, cuting toxic people out and surrounding myself with more positive people who i actually like.

Its not like my efforts have been for nothing. Its gotten better over the years don't get me wrong. I was just under the belief that i could finally have my default changed to positive. 

Tldr: I have tried everything i could think of and succeded but still am feeling depressed/suicidal and need some suggestions on what to do next.

Thank you for reading and have a great day!"
833,I wanna die ,"I wanna die because for me,life doesn’t have a sense,and I suffer of depression,my life was full of depression and oppression,I hate myself,I’m worthless and I’m tired of this life."
834,The future seems so hopeless and bleak I don't know what to do,"I don't even know where to start. This is going to be long so I appreciate whoever reads this. I decided to try posting this because I literally feel like I am hollow entity just existing and I need someone to hear me. For some background though I guess, clinically I have major depressive disorder and GAD. I suspect I have some other mental illnesses (BPD and maybe ADHD) but have not been officially diagnosed yet. I am also on medication: Prozac. I've been on it since 2018 and I hate it. It was supposed to be a short term thing but I am very much still on it and see no end in sight. I was doing the best I have ever been in my life (granted I still had some major lows of course but averaged out) from 2022 up to the end of last year. I met the sweetest girl and am still in a very serious relationship with her. She has been my only and best friend since I met her as well. She was born and raised in another country and has lived here in the States for around 10 years. At the beginning of this past December she moved back to her country for college because she couldn't afford to go here. She is planning on moving back after she completes her degree there. Things have been pretty difficult for her there so far and whether she will be able to get into school is still up in the air. 

And the distance is killing me. And while I have been trying to be a lot more transparent with her about how I've been feeling and doing, I feel like I can't be 100% because I don't want to stress her out any more than she already is. Despite us calling every day and having no real reason to worry because our relationship is still strong and both of us are still determined to see this through, I have an extremely anxious attachment style in general and the long distance and bad internet there has made it so much worse. I have been struggling with constant obsessive behaviors like checking her social media profiles way too much, checking my phone to see if she texted me/when was last active every chance I get and spamming her with messages. 

My depression and anxiety have been off the chart these past two months. I'm at community college currently and hoping to transfer to a real school in the fall. I've always struggled a lot in school due to my mental health. My current GPA is on the lower side (not horrible) and I still have no idea what I really want to do for a career. I want to do something that will make 100K because I want to be able to provide for my girlfriend and our future life together, especially in a time when our economy is insanely bad, but I don't even know if that's possible considering my mental issues. I've been really struggling this semester too because of the big life change being long distance. I'm also working part time to save money to buy a flight to visit her for a month in the summer. I'd love to not have to work since school is stressful enough but I'm going to have to if I want to see her in the summers for these next few years because my parents don't approve of me visiting her and she can't afford to come here. Tickets are average about $2000.

I feel so hopeless. I'm wrestling with passive suicidal thinking, self harm and self destructive behaviors almost every day. I have frequent panic attacks and am super anxious anytime I am not texting with or on call with her. I get about 3-4 hours of sleep a day, any more than that and I'll get really bad, realistic nightmares. I know I need to stay strong for my girlfriend and she is the only reason I'm still here. Then the positives. They are not many and definitely feel outweighed by the bad but they are something I guess. I've been trying to replace my self harming with working out. I started boxing as well. I'm trying to get big (have always been pretty skinny) for my girlfriend when I see her you feel me lol. But other than that the only relief I get is doing my hobbies (very scarcely though because of anhedonia) and smoking weed. I threw my shit away though because it was becoming extremely unhealthy and was smoking way more I wanted/needed to. I am going to start again because it really did help me find relief but I'm gonna have a very honest conversation with myself that I have to use it responsibly and if I can't then I won't use it at all. 

That's pretty much all though. I feel like I'm crawling at this point. I don't know what to do other than find whatever little reason I can to keep going every day but the future just seems so hopeless. Thanks for reading if you did, I hope you have a blessed day/night :). "
835,Feels like I’m addicted to literally every source of dopamine,"No matter what it is, drugs, alcohol, video games, nicotine. It seems like I’m drawn towards it and it just consumes me. I know doing these things is horrible for me but I almost find peace in saying “fuck it, I don’t care” like there is almost a relief in just completely giving up. In the back of my mind I know it’s fuckin horrible for me and I’m just ruining my life but it’s so hard to give up all of these horrible habits I have. "
836,I wasted my best years with drugs,15-25  I don't even properly remember things happened I dropped out uni 3 times I don't have any skills my brain hurts. I have nobody besides my amazing parents they love me so much They are still giving me money paying my rent they want me healthy but I just cant I am junior in uni as 25 years old at easy major but I am still failing.(Sorry for bad English)
837,I’m done ,"I tried to kill myself a few months ago and failed

My older peers and family are now relating to me about their times with suicidal thoughts and action, some in fairly recent times. 

I’m 29(m) my outlook forward is so bleak and knowing that they still struggle just makes me want to give up. I’ve stopped responding to everyone around me I haven’t showed up to a work shift in weeks. "
838,Am I finally getting better or am I spiralling worse?,"I’m about to graduate school but I feel like I barely have any crazy memories (it’s all blurred) and haven’t lived my teens enough, I’ve never been in a relationship and I barely went out through my teenage summers due to depression and anxiety although I had very good friends and enjoyed my time through school (although felt very lonely and rotted in my room)

I’m aged 18 and finally breaking out of this shell that’s had a hold on me since I was maybe 14/15 , however I feel like everyone has matured and grown past me and had experiences that have aged them mentally while I’m still a child,

Is it too late to live life? In these next 2 years I will have to build a life while also trying to play catch-up with my teenage years and try do everything in a rush, but I feel like everything I wanna do is what school kids (13-17) are doing and I’m gonna look like a weirdo. 

Im still a virgin and yet to have my first kiss because to be honest I was never into the girls that were in my school despite having a pretty quite large amount of girls crushing on me throughout the years, but now I regret not going further with them because everyone seems now to be experienced with boys and a lot more mature now while I’m mentally 14! 

I have a crazy motivation to live life and I’ve been talking to people a lot more and reconnecting with people I pushed away to try and salvage these last teen years

I feel like maybe people who didn’t live as crazy in there teens will try and over compensate in there late teens/20s (usually ppl with strict parents ig) and people who lived crazy in there teens begin to settle down in there later teens or 20s so maybe I’m not as far behind as I think 

Am I mentally insane or do I still have a chance at life
"
839,I don't care about anything ,I can't get up in the morning sometime. It physically hurts to do so. I try my best to shower and brush my teeth to not be disgusting but it's very hard. It's been about 3 years of this and meds don't truly work plus visits to the psychiatrist are very expensive. I growing more and more desperate because I tell people I'm not doing well even family an they don't care. I don't care either but I want to make it clear and not have them be mad a me if they realize I get worse. 
840,Abandoned,"I’m a 35F (soon to be 36 in a few days) and I think it’s my time. The anniversary of my mamas death was last week and today my best friend of 10 plus years just told me she’s taking a “break” from our friendship because my depression is unsettling. I can’t hold on anymore. That was my last straw. 

I’m just forcing myself to be here because for my sister. But, honestly that’s not worth it to me anymore. I just want to cease to exist. Everyone eventually abandons me because of my mental health struggles. 

Thanks for allow me express here. "
841,Should I just accept that not everyone is meant to succeed in life?,"This might be a long read but they say talking helps. 25M here and my life is at a standstill. No career, no house, no car and nothing to my name and I'm trying my best. Day in day out I keep showing up for myself trying to better my situation to no avail. I'm not just sitting twiddling my thumbs and hoping for a miracle I keep trying everyday even on days where I have no motivation I still push myself I might not give it my all that day but I give whatever I can muster up. It's getting exhausting now to try and fail every single time maybe I'm being naive by thinking I can get what I want exactly the way I want it but... What was the point of me setting all those goals for myself, what was the point for aiming that high.

Realistically speaking clearly my ""best"" isn't good enough and maybe I should just accept that not everyone is meant to achieve their goals or succeed in life, it's sad and hard to accept but that is the reality I'm currently living in and it's not changing at all. I really tried, I'm tired of always having to pick myself up I want to give myself a pat on the back for once.... Just once. Honestly I'm not asking for overnight success but to see results no matter how small or ""insignificant"" I might deem them to be. Just so I can have a visible reason to keep going and not just hope that it'll get better one day. 

Knowing myself I will keep trying regardless lol the life I want to live is too pretty to give up on it but that light in my eyes is slowly dimming with every failure and really I can't wait for that day it finally fades ...coz then I'll have the courage to end it all and I'll finally be at peace. Life is too harsh for me and maybe death will comfort me then I'll never have to worry about what could've been had I not given up... I'll just never exist"
842,I just want to know whats wrong with me,"I left my house and felt disgusting, like no one should look at me and if they do it should be with disgust. It was a struggle enough just to leave the house it took me 2 hours just to get up. I feel the urge to kill myself but I know I won't, I self harm. Idk what the fuck is wrong with me but I just want to know"
843,I've given up,"I remember when I had so much life in me. So much hope for my future. There was always a chance that things could get better. It powered me through so much. 

I just dont see anything anymore. Every avenue, every door has some sort of block behind it. I know that whatever I want to do is impossible. I dont care about anything beyond short term pleasure. There's no way out. I'm simply just a worker bee designed to live a mediocre life & answer the dreams of someone else. My mind is trapped in the slowly decaying cage that is my body...just withering away and forgetting who I am. "
844,I’m just tired.,"Maybe tired isn’t the right word. I’m just numb and heavy in a way that I just can’t find the right words to describe it. I hardly sleep or eat anymore. My childhood dreams died with the little girl I once was. I find myself wishing that if I stayed still for long enough, I would just disappear."
845,So lonely and sick of scammers ,"I want to kill myself, every dating app is filled with scammers. This world is not made for people who are nice. Might as well exit it so I don't keep getting hurt 🔫

All I want is a friend to play games with. I was so depressed in high school and now I have no friends.

Not confident enough to talk to people in real life. The anti depressant don't work. My therapist barely helps. I'm a fucking looser. What's the point of trying if nothing helps... maybe if I kill myself I find out if heaven exists. Maybe then I can feel some ammout of joy. Seeing other people loving life makes me jealous that I can't be like that.

Everyone around me keeps telling me I'm smart or that I'm a good person, but what's the point. I don't have the confidence to do anything. I want to go to college but last time I tried I just couldn't talk to anyone. I just want to get drunk and die. 

Sorry rambling I'm just so sick of major depression and want to give up. I'm just sitting in my chair crying thinking about how ill be a failure for my entire life, and how I'm a parasite leeching of my parents"
846,I stopped taking my antidepressants,"Around 1 month ago I stopped taking the meds that have been doing their work for a year. It was not a conscious decision; I just kept forgetting to take them and then I couldn't start. Now I don't really want to, but now I'm feeling extremely lonely. I've always struggled with loneliness; the feeling of not having a significant other and not being someone else's n°1 priority (besides themselves, ofc) is one of my biggest issues.
I wanna know if this intense feeling is just a few bad days/weeks or if this is really how I feel without the medication. Do you think is worth the try? I mean, not getting back to the meds until I figure out if I start feeling better or not.
Also, even before I stopped taking the meds -around 3 month ago, I started longing for a partner. Is it normal? Until then, I was comfortable being single; I was working on myself (I got back to uni) so I really didn't mind not having a partner. Do I want one because of the progress I've made? Is it the loneliness? Is it both?
For the record, I have an amazing relationship with my sisters and with my two best friends. I also started a group activity where everyone is super nice and cool to hang out with. But the loneliness is there, does anyone want to share their thoughts? "
847,I don't know what to do anymore,"I hate feeling like I don't exist

Lately I've been more depressed than usual. I'm alone and just want anyone. I'll talk to people and they act like I'm not even there. The only time people remember me is when they need my help or money. I just so sick of it. I've tried more weed and even started drinking again but still im just numb and nonexistent "
848,Don't really wanna die. Don't really wanna get better. Just wasting time until something forces me to choose,"I've spent such a huge portion of my life dealing with the same exact problems and it's not getting any better, but I'm also not doing anything to improve. Always struggled with school, and never learned how to talk to people or make friends or do anything by myself. I'm currently in my 3rd year of university (20 yrs old. Not at all proud of myself for making it this far), yet I still fail to accomplish the most trivial tasks, like writing an email, making a phone call, replying to messages, doing homework, cooking, cleaning, exercising, and so on. I've never had a job, nor do I have the social skills or willpower to get one. All I can do is leech off my parents until they tell me to grow the fuck up. I've struggled with ADHD for as long as I can remember, anxiety since 4th grade (8-9 yrs old)(might've had it longer, but this is when it started interfering with school), and suicidal thoughts since 5th grade (9-10 yrs old), but I don't think I was actually depressed until 7th or 8th (11-13 yrs old). I started seeing a therapist in 8th grade, and continued to see her until my first year of university; however, I would often put off scheduling appointments or forget to do so for long periods of time. She wasn't happy about that, since therapy doesn't really help if you don't go, but I just can't be bothered to put effort into anything, so I eventually stopped making appointments altogether. I've been taking antidepressants since 9th or 10th grade, when I started dealing with OCD on top of everything else; now I'm on 300mg of wellbutrin, and I'm supposed to go up from 175mg of zoloft to 200mg. This took care of the OCD (save for a few lingering ""quirks""), but I don't think it's doing jack shit for my depression and social anxiety. 

Sometimes I feel like I don't want it to get better; I just want it to go away. Sure, I'd probably feel better if I ate right, exercised, did my homework, meditated, went back to therapy, etc., but I'd rather pretend that the problem will somehow fix itself if I continue doing fuck all. The only way I know how to deal with difficult situations is to ignore them. I'm too much of a coward to kill myself, so instead I'm just letting the years go to waste until I either get the motivation to fix my life or the guts to end it. With how absolutely fucking incapable I am at everything, maybe it would be better to erase this mistake altogether. Do I even deserve to be alive if I won't put in the work to become a functioning member of society? I don't know.

Writing it all out feels so surreal, because I know it's all true and yet there's still a strong disconnect between the me that's cognizant of my problems and the me that's always distracted. Shit, I don't even know if this is how I actually feel. I ran out of zoloft almost a week ago and I can't get a refill because of the cyberattack. Sorry about the wordiness; I have a lot on my mind and no one to talk to."
849,Help,"I feel so down I moved to Toronto to work as a graphic designer and study marketing; it's been 6 months, and I haven't found a job. My long-distance girlfriend just broke up with me after a two-year relationship because she is tired of trying to put in any effort, I don't like staying where I came from because I wasn't able to grow and thought the move might help. I feel like I'm drowning, I can't feel any good emotions, and I am slowly burning through my savings. I feel like an alien among everyone I know. I don't know what to do. Everyone likes my work and compliments my personality, but I can't seem to gain a win in any part of my life. Why does the world seem like it'll swallow me whole?"
850,not feeling well,i skipped 2 days of my medication and i am feeling horrible. i have relapsed and eating less. i don’t know what to do and i have been so angry at everyone and crying constantly over small things. i am in pain and feeling suicidal. i am 15 and bipolar. i have been on suicide watch and i am currently on self harm watch and considered “high risk”. please help.
851,Being alone for a long time sucks ,"Lately I've been isolated in my room in front of the computer almost 10 hours a day for work. I'm home alone and don't really have friends or family or anywhere I can go since I also struggle financially and lately seems like you need an insane amount of money to do the most mundane things. Hate the economic situation badly...
I don't have a partner either so basically I don't have anyone to really talk or to rely on. No money for therapy, the free resources have an infinite queue that will keep you waiting for so much time. 
Days like today I feel so lonely. Like there's no one to catch me when I'm about to fall. 
I have been supresing the tears for so long. I don't really remember the last time I cried. Specially since I'm so busy lately. I thought that if I didn't have the time to even cry my mind will stay at ease, occupied with other stuff. But the more time passes by the more I realize I'm just putting on a facade.
I'm so tired and lonely. Feel like anything I do is enough. Taking care of my family problems and being others punching bag. My mom is around for some time a day due to her work but when she is home she mostly talks about work problems and honestly I don't even know how to respond to her. I'm home alone not even able to talk to a human face to face to keep paying the bills and the little time I get to be with her she keeps complaining about work and being tired.
I feel bad for thinking this way, but why do I have to endure her problems and my ongoing depression and problems too. It's so unfair. That's how I think sometimes. And it makes me sick, I feel like a child who just complains and puts the blame of their shitty life in someone else. 
I guess I just want to feel like there will be someone for me when I feel like this. I'm not asking for advise or for them to listen I just want someone to hug me while I cry and feel like I'm not doing this for nothing that my existence is valued by someone that there is someone I can look for. "
852,What my therapist said,"I am pretty depressed for the past few months. I have lots of suicidal ideation, I fantasize about it often. I was looking for advice because I notice it’s a pattern in my life for me to feel this depression a few times per year or maybe 1 big depression each year. She basically said I should have more grit, stand up for myself, and stop taking shit from people.

A big part of what makes me feel depressed is my job (I hate it but don’t feel like I can find anything better). And my interpersonal relationships (my friends aren’t very kind to me and I’m extremely single even though I have gone on many dates and put in effort, and I don’t have the best family situation so I live across the country from them). So in short I’m very lonely and the connections I do have make me feel even more alone. 

She said I need more control in my life. 

She said I should start going to church again and try to rely on those communities for that connection. I actually agree with her. I also need to take more steps towards getting a new job. I work with middle schoolers and was assaulted by a student at my job a few weeks ago, and now even though I’m in different classes students are still very rambunctious and loud and very disrespectful.. it really wears on me and I feel anxious constantly. I’m just in the depressed there is no point to life mood at this point but I’m hoping I can get myself out of it because I don’t want to take medication. "
853,Needing to calm down ,"Hi! I just turned a year older and for the past week and a half or so I’ve been spiraling out of control. I keep feeling guilty and replaying all the things I’ve done in my life and get the ick with myself. I see that I’m going through the same self sabotaging spiral that I’ve done since I was a child. In my mind and heart I want this spiral and feeling of no control to stop. I feel like this cycle is never ending and I’m mentally shutting down. I requested a mental health day for work tomorrow and I feel guilty for taking that. I’m in such a dark place and the other day when I turned a year older, I did want to take my own life to avoid living my sad life on replay. I can’t describe it, I feel like I’m in a funnel of clouds and can’t navigate clearly. It’s like a trauma train that I can’t escape from. I used to take Zoloft for my medication, but stopped because it made me gain weight. I’m currently in therapy and will be doing EMDR for certain things. I guess I’m just tired or feeling like this and it’s impacting me and my partner. Plus work because I’m so distracted and disengaged when I’m in a leadership role. It’s tiring. I hate feeling this way and I have tried to shake it off. (The day of my birthday, this pain was so bad I wanted it to end if you get my drift.) Adding on to that, I feel like I have no talent and I’m boring. I zone out when I talk to people and can’t hold a conversation. Please help and thank you. "
854,I don't know rant ,"(Diagnosed Psychotic Depression)

These voices are getting better not worse but doing just enough damage while in these meds to make me contemplate if I should go back to the hospital but I'm afraid of my insurance and don't wanna put my family in any trouble since I'm only 24(in Aug) and are still under their plan. Maybe my ex really did finally set me over the edge, I'm afraid to go to sleep last night I had a dream of a online streamer smaller streamer where we become friends in person despite being in a different state wasn't romantic at all and I don't see her that was but as a friend and idk if it's bc I wanna be friends with her or if it's bc I miss having a freind in general.😔 I'm so empty "

856,College,"My dad keeps threatening to kick me out and go find somewhere else to live if I don’t catch up on my school work for college. He would never kick me out but I’m tired of him threatening me. I haven’t done any work in 3 months after my mom died.

I can’t care about school or my life. It’s already hard enough to not kill myself everyday. Suicide is one of the only things I think about. I can barely get out of bed to play games on my computer. How am i supposed to do school.
He yells and curses at me then says he loves me and he wouldn’t me yelling at me if he didn’t care. Everything is getting worse everyday.

What makes is harder is my 14 year old sister going to school everyday and studying and doing homework while I can’t even will myself to do anything. What’s wrong with me"
857,Fighting the good fight,"Long time lurker, first time poster. 31(m), I lost my sales job in December of ‘22 a month before my 30th birthday. Before that job, I’d worked in sales and saw success for 6 years, and decided to take a leap of faith into a more volatile industry and was chewed up and spit out.

It wasn’t until June of ‘23 that I found a new sales role, but at this point I had worsening symptoms of anxiety + depression, and my normal “body armor” of substance use was no longer serving me. I was even offered a new job in March of '23, which was quickly rescinded after failing a drug screening and testing positive for cannabis. I live in Colorado and my previous role was with a cannabis company, so I naively thought it wouldn't be a big deal. 

This sent me on a sober journey that I’m still battling as I’ve now been sober from cannabis for 319 days, alcohol and nicotine for 141 days. I haven’t relapsed since deciding to quit but feel like I’m white knuckling it most of the time. I’ve even given up all social media (except Reddit) hoping to find some sort of euphoria, clarity or at least an intrinsic motivation that I’ve yet to see. I was a daily weed smoker for 10 years, and had been drinking socially since I was 14 - after some pretty intense bullying in middle school - which has probably had a more intense impact on my mental well being than I care to admit.  

I was highly functional in my substance abuse until Covid, which seemed to derail my mental health more than I was aware of at the time. I even trained for and ran in a marathon in under 4 hours in hopes that I it would change my life and how I looked at myself.  It it did for a short amount of time, but ultimately worsened my depression afterwards. I can’t seem to shake the idea that there’s some silver bullet out there that will fix me, whether it be a new job, new girlfriend, or new way of living. I feel like I’m stuck in a trance of unworthiness, which has grown exponentially worse since turning 30 and the dread of getting older continues to settle in. I feel like I need to constantly be accomplishing something, or standing on some moral high ground of self discipline in order to be worthy of love and happiness.

I’ve been seeing a therapist since November of last year, and even took a leave from my current job to take part in an intensive outpatient program for adults struggling with depression that meets three days a week. In that time I’ve tried CPT, CBT, DBT all with varying levels of relief but still struggle some days to get out of bed. Some days feel like huge breakthrough, and others feel like I’m back to square one. I just feel like such a fuck up and can’t let go of the idea that I’ve failed or won’t find happiness as I continue to get older. I let my job define my self worth so much that when I lost it, I felt like a shell of who I once was.  Loneliness has become more prevalent as I’ve gotten sober and tend to avoid social interaction. I think I have social anxiety that I numbed with substances for a majority of my life. Emotions hit me like huge waves, but I welcome them the best I can. Other days I feel completely numb.  

I hoped to feel increasingly better as I continued to remove substances from my life, but it only revealed a depression I’d been numbing for much longer than I’d realized. I’m so tired of being hard on myself for my past, and wish I could focus more on the good things in my life because there are so many to be grateful for. I’m so extremely lucky to have a loving and supporting family/friends but it feels hard to face them when I feel so numb, I feel like something is broken inside me and it won’t get any better. Weed helped me shut of that voice for so long and now I feel like I've abandoned myself by giving it up. At many points in my life, my relationship with weed felt like it was saving my life, not hurting it - and I am struggling to appreciate why I gave it up in the first place.

I write this because I’m hoping to connect with others who’ve experienced something similar, and to express gratitude for communities like these that lift its members up. We are all messy humans just trying to get home. I stand with you all, fighting the good fight in hopes of living a happier and healthier life for ourselves and those who love us.

TLDR; Sometimes it gets worse before it gets better. Getting sober showed me stuff I needed to work on that I didn’t even know was there, but I’m grateful for those who sit with me in the struggle and love me when it’s hard to love myself.

858,I'm feeling the need to complain and be a big baby,"So every time I write out a post and it's usually to get advice or to talk about shit.  Like for example..i go to the abuse survivor reddit cause we'll I'm being abused and wanted to talk to anyone about it but literally no one cares.  No one even comments.  But i see other posts from others that get like 3,000 comments and it'll be the same kind of post that i posted. What gives.  And I have no friends.  I don't trust anyone because I've been abused by everyone I've ever loved or they kill themselves. Sometimes I'd like to and need to just vent for a minute. I just want someone to listen and maybe give feedback. And not rude feedback. . "
859,I literally just want to die,"I just have this grey cloud hovering over me all day. I’m not allowed to be happy, I can’t believe in myself or be positive. I feel like I’m not in control of my own life and I’m finding it impossible to navigate it. I feel I have nothing to live for and nothing to offer. I feel completely worthless "

Im so damned upset, why the fuck won’t she reply to my emails?? How can they just give three pills at once to someone and not check in for side effects or in general check in????
May God fuck them all.

Also my way to cope is to take benzos and drink because fuck life "
861,How does it taste?,"My teeth haven't been white since I first picked up a cigarette, and who cares if I need them? The roof of my mouth has burned less than I have as a person, and who cares if I reverse where I'm burned? My tongue has told more truth than my hears have ever heard, and who cares if it never creates another word? My cheeks have been hit harder than they could ever gather the force to blow, and who cares if they ever fill up again?

863,Trying to find control in anything I can.,"Hey I'm not sure if this is considered the right place but I realized that I am searching for control in my life. I don't take care of myself because I don't want to do my best and be told it isn't good enough.

I have a scraggly unkempt beard and I don't do anything with my hair, it's usually sticking up. I am also kinda lazy I guess but it's less of that and more what's the point?

I hate myself so much. I have been taught to hate myself and guilt by others. But if I instead love myself and say fuck everyone else then I'm good. I do this weird thing because I feel I have no control in my life. 

Like I don't want to be clean. I don't want to take care of my self and I don't want to be better. I don't want to be everything everyone wants me to be. I kinda joke that I see myself as like diogenes and I like the fact that the guy did whatever he wanted. But the guy would pretty much be seen as a crazy homeless man today.
It's funny too cause like I have lived a pretty decent life materially speaking anyway and if I lived like that I would literally be homeless.

Idk I just am angry at the world. I was hurt a lot as a kid and I never really got over it. I was so naive and that was what I hated the most out of myself. I was so easy to be taken advantage of. 

So I am now a cynical and bitter old man. Or rather I feel like one in my 20s. I used to be so outgoing and fearless and kind etc. And now I fluctuate between fearful to do anything and anxious and self hating. To complete nonchalance and willingness to be brave and just not give a shit no matter what happens. 

I just want someone to tell me what to do. But if they tell me I will tell them to fuck off and do my own thing... I spent so much time doing what other people tell me. It's fucking with my mind.

I don't really even feel alive honestly. I just feel like I am a passenger in my own life. I would rather fail of my own accord then succeed following someone else.

I am struggling. I wish I was not cursed to put other people before my own. I feel like I must always be subservient to others. I feel I am not worthy of anything. 

I feel worthless. I feel I am a completely worthless person. And I have felt this way for decades. The only value I have is as a ""jester"" or as someone who doesn't care what other people think. 

I put on a brave face sometimes but in reality I am a hurt sensitive person who tries to be strong and doesn't know how. Everyone keeps hurting me if I am open and soft so I harden and become strong and bitter. A bit of hate too, and then I get told ""hate is bad, it's your fault!"" It's almost funny. 


Like imagine a kid being told he is just as bad as the bully because the Billy's hand is sore from beating the kid so much... dang morally is just so questionable who really is in the right here? They are both as bad? That didn't happen to me that was just an example.

I don't even know where I am at here I'm just ranting. I feel like I have no control over my own life. Ironically I actually made some small improvement in my life recently, I stopped playing video games for a couple weeks and am happy I did. My life has been getting better or at least I am able to get to work a bit easier. 

But like what's the point? Work will still not be as exciting as fun things. But even thought it has been stressful some parts have been interesting and I am figuring things out. Part of me also wonders why I even try to be better anyway if life sucks so much.

I guess I just have no hope for the future, I remember when I almost got hit by a bus 10 years ago by accident and I was actually sad it didn't end me. I still feel that way sometimes. 

I hate myself so much. I fluctuate between these feelings but I have hated myself for decades. I hate myself when I sacrifice everything and turn into a soulless yuppie workaholic doormat. I hate myself when I say fuck it and just survive. I hate myself when I say fuck the consequences I am doing my own thing. No matter what I do I can't be content. 

Ironically the one thing that I have found has brought me peace, is when I say fuck the consequence. I don't care about anyone else's opinions or thoughts. I will not be put down and treated like shit. I don't care about the consequences I will live free. I am ok with losing a fight if I am honest with myself. It's not about the result it's about the choice.

My mind is slipping. Or well it's been slipping for years but I haven't been taking care of myself. Honestly right now all I can do is hold on and do the bare minimum. I have a job, and my own place, and a car, and I don't have any responsibilities like a wife or kids, I have the capability to do fun things like watch movies or play games or find something good to eat. Well I guess scratch the video games but yeah. I dont have too many wants really.

But I still get like this. No matter what happens in my life I don't think I will ever he happy. I can win the lottery tommorow and win a billion dollars... after taxes and then I will just be worried about losing my money!! I will find some cool things to do and I won't worry about survival but then what? I literally would not be happy with a billion dollars. I would still pick to have it tho lol cause I would rather be sad with money then sad without money. 

Idk what I am even saying anymore I'm going to sleep and will probably delete this at some point. My life is getting better, but no matter what happens in my life it feels like I always come back to feeling like this. Today was alright. I will focus on doing what I can. Don't need to be perfect just need to move my legs forward. I would rather fail on my feet then fail when I could have done something. I accept I am not perfect no matter how hard I try to be. I accept I make mistakes. I will just take things day by day, I will not worry about 10 years in the future or 10 years in the past. The only me that exists is the present not the future or past. I will do things thst make me better or make me happy that's all I can do. 

I will not worry about the future no matter what happens I will accept and try to change what i can."

865,it's never going to be better,"I'm posting this because I don't really have anyone who I can pour my heart out to. Truth is, everything has gotten worse since 2020, when the pandemic had a really big impact on my mental health. I'm a very shy person, who has a lack of communication skills hence I can't hold a normal conversation with anyone, because I always become awkward/embarrass myself. In the past, I used to be very optimistic about my problems, I used to think that everything will have a solution. Now, I'm just hopeless. I don't have time for myself at all because I always have to study/I don't have enough energy to take care of myself. I keep asking myself what's the point of self care if I'm gonna die soon  (I don't see myself alive past 25 or lower because I can't function properly). I have lost many opportunities, thinking that I would always fail, because I'm really stupid, even though I have the highest marks in class. But that's because I spend a lot of time studying instead of doing something for my wellbeing (I don't want to disappoint anyone). Despite this fact, I'm really convinced that I'll be a total failure. Generally, I feel alright when I'm anchored in the present, but when it comes to thinking about the future, I start crying. Im finishing highschool in a year and I have to think about choosing an university. Problem is, I haven't figured out what I like yet. I can't try new things because I don't have enough time for that. Almost the entire time I'm in my room. It sucks that, in the end, I would have to choose a random university which other people might have chosen based on their passions. Life is really unfair. I don't know what I want from it, and if something comes to my mind, I would always deny it because the chances of achieving it are quite low. I really hate myself."
866,I think it's time,"Short and to the point. It's time for me to kill myself. I know people will say it's not the answer. This consumes my life, everyday. I'm 38, had this I was a kid and nothing gets better. Going through to much trauma and abuse, being trapped in my life and cycles of just fucking up everything. I'm burnt out from helping out a family member who refuses to do anything to help themselves and dragging me with them. 
I knew I would end up like my father who took his own life. 
Like father like son. 
When I figure out the where I can do it it will be done in a few weeks. "
867,At some point I lost the ability to even demonstrate I'm feeling bad (venting),"I am 21y old and are openly trans to almost everyone (including my parents but they just ignores it and acts like I never told them nothing about it).

So, when I was younger I really had depressive crisis, I didn't eat, shower and that kind of thing. Of course people get worried about what was happening to me. But, as the time goes and the feeling doesn't go away, and I started to understand what I was feeling better, I kinda lost the ability to demonstrate I'm feeling bad. I surely control my depressive and anxiety tendencies better now. But at some point it stopped to be about me getting better and started to be about me getting function as an human being.

I feel I just needs to keep going. Going to college, trying to eat well, sleep enough, interact with people that like me as much as I like them. But that is not true, I just suck at feeling good, I'm not sad just right now, I'm sad.

Day in day out and nothing changes. I still have the same fear of death and in a paradoxal way, a death wish. I think I just want to go over it soon. I still counting the days I'm prohibited to live like myself. I look the news and doom scrolling just to confirm that the world wants me dead or people with big money are destroying it.

I feel that way since I was like, 5 years or something. Sometimes I blame my parents, thinking they cursed me. Sometimes I cursed the people that throw hate towards me just because I was a little fat when I was a kid, or because I'm autistic. 

Sorry, it ended up being too long."
868,I don't know how or what I feel,"there's a lot to unpack here, but i might as well start from the beginning;

at 2 years of age (2009), my father and mother divorced and my mother won custody and from then on, I've been living with my mother, seeing my father every Wednesday (which then changed to Tuesdays due to his work schedule). Until he moved to Florida in around late 2019-to early 2020 (before COVID hit, and for personal reasons I don't want to squander), but before that, he had a child (my half sister) in 2012, and when he left for Florida, she was devasted, and broke down in tears when he left (i will come back to this later, but we have to get back to the point, the beginning is already long enough).

at 3, i was diagnosed with ADHD, and autism in 6th grade; i was a good kid, a bit of a trouble maker, but i was an overall good kid. and I struggled with speaking my true feelings, i just followed the crowd and was (probably) seen as the naïve kid that was too kind for his own good. I was truly too kind.

in December of 2017, my grandfather (my father's father) lost his life in his second battle with cancer, my entire family was devastated, but mainly me; i was 10 when that happened. yes, i knew death was dangerous and was not to be taken lightly, but to have it happen to a loved one i held close to me be taken from life hurt me, and my little 10 year old brain couldn't handle it, so for the next 2 years when ever my grandfather (I'll just call him ""papa"", because that's what I've always called him as a kid) came to my thoughts or even being mentioned around me, i would only cry; cry, cry, cry, all the tears just went down my cheeks, i couldn't handle it.

somewhere when i was in 5th(?) grade, my mother was in a car accident that made her quite disabled, she would have seizures, she could have mood swings, and she would become verbally aggressive if her top blew off,

and back to when my father left for Florida, my half-sister (I'll just call her ""cis"") called me on her phone and cried through the speaker, and I did something i still regret to this day, I told her to grow up. to get over it. it wasn't until years later that i was told first-hand that I was just used to my father leaving (we still have a good relationship, and this is probably why I don't feel any hate towards him), a week after i told cis this, i did apologize to her, so do not worry.

in December of 2019, an event in my life came to fruition that i could never forget: i wanted to take my own life. it was something huge in my life, none of us could EVER forget; my parents found out, my father found out, a huge amount of my family found out, and I was sent to ""mercy hospital"", somewhere in Illinois. for the time i spent there, it was the LONGEST 3-4 days of my life; i was then let out with pretty much a pat on my back and a ""don't come back here again, suic\*de is a no-no."" it stuck with me in a bad way, and I've developed this warped, twisted view on suic\*de as the ""cowards way out of life"" (call me out and/or hate me if you want, i understand your judgmental feelings, i hate that i think this way as well).

this next event I'll shed on lightly, because it hurts my mother deeply, but my uncle (at the age of 40-41), was m\*rdered in July of 2020. it devasted my entire family, just as much as papa's passing. it only made my mental health even worse, as well it made my mother raise her tone when she angry to an 11. if she became too mad, she would make fun/call out your own problems and dreams and compare them to her own, and how they were squandered for her. but she was still a kind woman, and i admire my mother, good and bad just like my bio-father (my mother married my step-dad in 2016).

and now in 2024, sophomore in high school, have a 3.7 GPA (due to being pushed by my parents, peers, and other family members), and I've begun developing feelings and/or problems mentally:

1. i hate being around people, but i hate being alone and/or forgotten.
2. i hate being threatened, along with threatening other people.
3. I've begun to have constant nightmares (3-4/7 days of the week) where i lose control and hurt the people i hold close to me.
4. if i cry or lose myself in an argument or confrontation, i feel like I'm ""playing the victim"".
5. i have the feelings of ""I'm worthless"", ""maybe they would be better off without me"", ""i do nothing to help"", ""maybe I'm better off dead"", and more; but on the last one, i cruelly remind myself that suic\*de is the ""cowards way out of life"", and somehow it convinces me.

I've also made a ""facade"" or multiple ""facades"" where I can be this charismatic, smart, funny, and chill individual, but it's more of a shell to hide the hurt inside myself, to the point I can almost act emotionally immature due to me acting more on impulse.

it hurts that this is where i am now, i have huge dreams for the future, i want to become a manga (Japanese comic) artist, and more; but this constantly haunts me, to the point i secretly made a deal with myself ""if i don't make it big, I'm a failure""; and it stays in the back of my mind to this day.

so, kind people of this subreddit, what the hell is wrong with me?

(Edit: I'm not sure if I have depression or not, but this seemed to be the safest place for me to vent and to get positive feedback from, so sorry if this ""offends you"" or anything, that is NOT what I'm trying to say/go for, sorry in advance! 🙏)"
869,Don’t function at any appreciable level,"Every foray into independence throughout my life has culminated in thorough psychosis. It takes maybe 2 months maximum every time before apathy and avolition relegate me to the bed and maybe the store for beer. Everyone observes me existing and infers that it is appropriate to treat me like a subhuman. I don’t even say or do anything before people are terrible to me. My landlord threw all of my possessions into the trash without having the courtesy of notifying me. Or perhaps even stole the valuables. lllegal act after illegal act but I imagine he assessed that I’m a 31 year old male with no friends, money or job and that he could do what he wants with impunity. And he’s kinda right, it’s too fucked up and sadistic for me to deal with. People don’t confer basic human decency on me. I don’t qualify. 
No quantifiable progress has been made toward anything ever. I’m still maybe developmentally 16 but I’m 31. I can’t condense 15 years of milestones and progress into a few weeks, hell even a few months. I’ve spent most of my adulthood horizontally decomposing in bed or vertically decomposing in a computer chair. No more youthful naïveté, I am now that maladjusted loser weirdo who makes people uncomfortable by just existing and I have been for some years. No exogenous intervention will occur and if solutions haven’t been internally derived over the course of the last decade or so, there’s no reason to believe it will happen tomorrow or next year or next decade. I don’t really want to go through another humiliation ritual of cartoonish failure at mimicking an adult. It doesn’t serve any purpose. Ive gleaned 0 insight. The ubiquitous feedback I get is shut up and fuck off and die."
870,I want to end my life,"I feel useless, good for nothing. I don't see any reason to continue living. "
871,Am I depressed lol how do I get help ,Hii I'm reposting this in case you saw it before  but I had to delete it because of weird messages but I think I'm depressed. No one really cares about me. I told my mom I was depressed and she didn't really care lol. I'm sad all the time and idk what to do. I'm younger and a girl if it matters but I don't want to say exactly because of weird guys here 😀
872,I need help and I don’t know what to do.,"I’m 19 and I’m a male, I’ve felt overwhelmingly depressed for almost the past year now. It took me while to realize just how messed up I was. I want to keep this section short so I can paint a picture of how I’m feeling

For starters, the moment it really all started was when I moved from Maryland to North Carolina, that’s when my mental health went south. Normally a move is challenging but gives way to eventual triumphs and new experiences. Not for me though. My family and I moved down here in the summer of 2022 and it just so happens that I was a senior in highschool when I did move. So I spent all my life in Maryland and then move down here to North Carolina to spend my last year of high school with strangers. 

That wouldn’t be a problem to most, but for me, as the months went on, the more and more I thought how robbed I was of having spent my final year of highschool surrounded by my friends and teachers I’ve grown to know over the years. 

It was a gradual feeling at first though. It’s natural that you’ll be alone for the first few weeks when you know absolutely no one in a new highschool, but you’ll make friends. Not me though. As the months went on, I found myself increasingly lonely and isolated from everyone and everything, especially the day I graduated which felt like an absolute gut punch. Here I was, the most defining moment in supposed to be proud of… and I still felt like I was an alien amongst earthlings at my graduation because no one knew who I was, even after all that time… 

Now that we have a pretty good picture as to why I feel this way, I want to explain how I felt. Right around February of 2023 is when it really started happening. I would wake up early in the morning for school, a complete lack of motivation or energy to do anything. I would go to school anyway because I would fail if I didn’t. While at school, I didn’t do any work at all. Like nothing… then I would come home, feeling absolutely horrible for no reason, lay in bed, and start crying and obsessing over most of everything on my mind and what I was stressed about. That would happen for hours or a day or so at a time. 

Then the following day, I’d be perfectly fine, still tired and groggy, but fine nonetheless. I would go to school and do what was asked and required of me. 

It would continue on and off like that throughout the next year and into this one as well. I would wake up feeling horrible with no motivation to do anything and go back to bed or lounge around and play video games. And then some days, I would be fine… 

I get way more of these depressive episodes than I do actually good ones. It has gotten so bad that I feel absolutely no motivation to start taking steps into becoming an adult. I have no motivation to get a job or get my full drivers license. Everyone always tells me I need to go do it and to just get up and do it, but like I said, I feel absolutely no motivation to do it. Most days, I’m in my room, either in bed and watching tv or just playing video games while eating. 

Overall, I feel hopeless most days and sometimes even just completely shut down and spend the entire day in my room, just doing whatever to pass time until I get tired and go to bed. 

The long and short of it is, I didn’t start feeling depressed until February of last year, I have no motivation, always feel tired, go to bed and wake up at extremely late times, do nothing all day until I get tired and go to bed… 

I have absolutely no idea what to do or how to solve it. I don’t even feel motivated to provide any more context or information in this post… I’m sorry if I sound so ambiguous. But I just need help. I’m scared feeling this way will lead to something horrible happening to me in the future… "
873,Suicide is imminent,"Im 22 yo with nothing to show for
Have no friends to form deep relationships with
I cant see a future where im not depressed constantly, suffering from severe bipolar and ocd which took over my life nearly a decade ago, i despise humanity as a whole and living means being a slave forever or confronting issues or milestones i dont want any part of.


I i hate women and men with a passion and think of all as the worst of mankind. No solace whatsoever other Than locking myself in a dark room and drinking my self unconscious, recently i started taking unprescribed medication in dangerous quantities hoping i dont wake up the next morning. Everything around me is so dark and negative and i cant deal with the thoughts or the nightmares which occur every single night

I feel worthless, like a gust of wind about to replace. I despise my family which mostly dealt harm as long as i can remember. Strangers are no different. There is no sympathy in this world and nothing makes sense. You could die tomorrow in the most horrific manner and the world keeps on spinning. It makes no sense. 

I’ve always been a good person, showing kindness and empathy to get none back.
I dont know why i deserve this. Maybe im unlikeable. Ego is too much and shattering it means the end of the world for me. Fuck man i might just do it someday, if only i had a gun
Nobody reads this shit but it is my letter and las respects. Its been nice living in a bottomless pit for 2 decades and change see ya baby

874,I feel like I'm running out of time ,"The random compliments have stopped, the reassuring words of encouragement from those in my life are gone and I'm tired. I'm just tired all the time, I've slipped into a redundant routine where I am no longer productive at work or at home. I've stopped checking in on my friends because I don't have the energy for it anymore, the gesture has never been returned to me. I keep saying I'll keep going, and I will but it's hard and I don't have much left in me. 

Truth be told if my dog died today, I'd be gone tomorrow."
875,I don’t know what to do now,"For context, I live in a country where I get to choose what high school to go to via entrance exam.

I was pretty depressed and suicidal before I got into high school. I had just moved to a new country, and was struggling to make friends or study due to the language barrier. Despite this, I managed to get through it because I had hope that I could get into an English school and be able to communicate comfortably. I thought that i was depressed because of my environment, and once things got better I would be happy.

I’m now in an English high school, where I have close friends, a boyfriend, a family that loves me, and good education. I literally have everything I could want, but I don’t feel any better. I feel hopeless because if I have everything I want and still feel like this, how could I get any better? 

My attendance is shit because most days I feel like there’s no reason to go anymore. I have no hopes for the future. I go to therapy once a month, but I’m thinking of quitting because it seems unhelpful. I also take meds but I can’t tell if they’re even doing anything anymore. What do I do now?

I tried different deodorants and antidepressants but nothing works. Why are my antidepressants causing this and how can i reduce the sweating"
877,Just wondering if there's anyone to speak to right now... ,"24 (F). 
I want to commite suicide. I just decide it. The only thing is holding me back is my graduation and my family. I'm not even struggle with the decission anymore. I struggle with the when and how. 

Last year very sad things happen: broke up 4 years relationship, my 2 pets died, had to postpone the semester, bad health issues, and a orthodontic treatment that come up fucking bad. My face change. Not in the 'you lose weight face', but in the 'you fucked up your face with braces face'....i was beautifil wdf was i thinking, I just discover than wisdoms extractions change the face. 


In january i was diagnosed with autism and add. Depression, anxiety. I'm feeling alone in a way i can describe it in words. People treat me like shit, more than ever, 'cause i look fucking bad, like skeleton. I just want to die. I just want to talk to someone before i do something stupid. 

Sorry if grammar errors"
878,Idolize my former abusive relationship cause it’s the only one I’ve ever had,"Clawed and fought and paid everything just to get that relationship too. That’s how fucking unlikable and unattractive I am. I had to give everything to her for a facsimile of love- for abuse. I literally saved her life AND SHE FUCKING ABUSED ME. She fucking ABUSED ME AND I SAVED HER. 

Is that your sick game god. Put me in these fucking situations saving someone also being made to feel like shit. Why don’t YOU JUST FINISH WHAT YOU FUCKING STARTED AND KILL ME. Kill me YOU FUCK.

If you can’t let me be loved, at least let me die a hero.

I’m in my late 20s now. The trajectory is set. Now if any person “””likes””” me, it’s going to be for money and money alone. I know you’re probably thinking that from a third person perspective I’m like some un-self aware jackass. But I genuinely have done a lot to try and be the best I can, socially too. But it’s not good enough. Because of what I am physically.

I do everything I can and it’s never enough. It never will be enough. How the fuck are you supposed to be “positive” when you are so unlikable and unattractive as this.

Truth is I’m tired of fighting. I’m so tired. Been fighting hard since kids attacked me on the playground or being raised to be a top competing student or what the fuck ever blah blah blah self pity. Always on a war footing. Always over the next hill- the dream. But when hope finally arrives, it’s some fucked up perversion of it.

People notice now. Me staring blankly into space or watching the horizon, frozen. They notice when my face contorts to pain or grim defeat. Doesn’t matter. It’ll only matter after I prematurely die.

All I ever wanted was to be loved.
And I’m starting to give up on that.

Nobody’s life is perfect.
But mine is really fucking with me.

At least tomorrow it’s just me. I don’t wanna deal with nothing.

My friend now… I love her, in a platonic way. I’m there for her. Helped her a lot. Always ask questions. I mention I’m depressed… not a further question about me. Just change the topic. I’m not mad though. Really. I want her to get with a guy and be happy as I fade away. That’s what we men gotta do. We gotta soldier on.

I’m listening to a whiter shade of pale.

At least I still cry. I still cry and claw my face to try and make it bleed a little. Shows I’m not a total corpse."
879,lost #3,does anyone else wonder if they’ll reach old age or not? as much as i’d love to see old age my mental health is a hassle to deal w on most days so if i don’t go out by suicide i’m curious to what would take me out besides that
880,what's the point in living?,"You're born, you grow up, go to school, find a job, grow up some more, get sick or grow old if you're lucky, you die.

What keeps you going? How did you find your goal in life? Because I certainly don't have them.

I graduated, I got a job, what now? 

It all just seems kind of pointless. I don't have any concrete thoughts of trying to end it all, but it's appealing I guess? The thought of disappearing and not existing anymore. I don't have to think about anything else. Just peace and quiet.

EDIT: I didn't think this post would have so many replies. But thank you for your efforts in giving me some answers. Some of these definitely made me think of what I really wanna do."
881,I think I'm starting to figure out how to live,"I'm a neurotic. I struggle mentally despite not having real problems. I'm always dwelling on the negative. Lately the issue I ruminate on is my retirement. Even if I save a lot I will be unprepared. I shouldn't have been a loner. If I got married and put down for a house I could look forward to my retirement in a home that was paid for. But I never thought that far ahead. Wasn't disciplined enough. So now I hope suicide options for old people become legal because how am I going to support myself in a home when I'm old? 

My dad said I turned my back on my family every time I tried to suicide. I think he's right. I want to change.

I recognize that I'm a neurotic. I feel guilty about my life. I have lived a blessed life in a good country and still I was miserable the whole time. All I do is work and watch tv. I feel like I should be doing something about the evil in the world but I'm just an ordinary person. I can't even take care of myself.

My new slogan is ""cook and be happy"". So basically I give up on trying to be a good person. All I'm good for is taking it one day at a time. 

I give up on math. I accept that I can't take it in. I accept that it makes my mental health worse without showing tangible results.  I wanted to make robots but I think it's time to accept that dream is out of my reach.

I feel like I'm supposed to do something with my life. I keep judging myself for how little I do but I think my mental health will be better if I tell myself it's ok to just work and take things one day at a time.

Thank you for your time. I just wrote here because I have no one to talk to. I'm ok not having anyone to talk to as long as I have somewhere to vent occasionally."
882,Disabled and depressed ,"Hello,

I am 23 years old. I used to be happy and my life was going so well. I had a cancer diagnosis when I was 16 in high school. I ended up staying in a hospital for a year and lost my leg. High school was the most fun chapter in my life and I feel like I was robbed of it.

Fast forward 7 years and I am now in university studying engineering. However, my disability and mental health state has made my progression in university very slow as in I'm almost failing everything. I used to be a very good student. I have no friends in university and ever since my surgeries I've struggles to make friends or talk to people.

I get so much FOMO when all my old friends played all the sports I wish I could play with them. It pains me not to be able to do things that are usually a given to people. I almost feel like a liability when I hang out with my friend group. I feel robbed of what could've been the best times of my life.

Eventually I've stopped taking care of myself. I've had more episodes where I would sit and cry or fall asleep and cry. I turned to drugs to make me happy and my bank account has taken a hit due to it. I feel like a really big failure in my parents eyes as they have invested so much into me.

I feel so alone. I've would've never ever thought of suicide. However, lately it's been in the back of my mind. I can't bear to wonder what my parents or friends and family's reactions would be. I love them so much and I just don't know what to do. I am a failure.

I was wondering if there's anyway I can get a prescription without my parents' knowledge. I can schedule myself an appointment with my PCP, although I'm not sure about the potential prescription part. I'm in California if that helps anyone. I am willing to pay out of pocket if that's what it means."

887,There is no rock bottom with depression,I thought I hit rock bottom four years ago and it couldn't get worse. I slept on my mental health and did not seek help. Things have recently gotten worse and I did finally start getting help with a therapist. My single biggest piece of advice I give my friends is to not ignore your mental health. Find help early even over small things. It can always get worse. The void of mental health misery is infinite.
888,How to help my husband,"My husband just came home from work which he left early because he had a panic attack. He is an ER Nurse and normally fine under pressure. I know he has been suffering from depression and is seeing a therapist, but it doesn't seem to be helping much.
He is also on 300mg wellbutrin prescribed by his pcp. I asked him if he wanted to go to a crisis center in the morning but he said that is for people who are suicidal. But I think having a panic attack so bad that you have to leave work seems like a crisis? I don't know what to do or how to help him. Any advice or suggestions appreciated."
889,Isolating myself is a new thing,"There are about 3 people in my life who kinda halfway have been making an effort to check in on me.

I isolate myself from them.

The energy to reply, to respond, isn't there. I have halfway given up on myself.

These people are so kind but i'm a lost cause.

I'll spend my days alone in my own company.

I feel like they couldn't understand what I'm going through, and I also don't want them to get irritated when I show little to no signs of improvement, when I am hiding cuts on my arms underneath my sleeves, when i am losing weight because I have no appetite anymore.

I never noticed myself isolating like this before. Scientifically and objectively it is interesting to me to watch a symptom like this worsen over time but emotionally on a personal level this is heartbreaking"

It completely changes my focus and I turn to a bit of self-destruction. Substance use, risky behavior, being on Reddit (frankly). I keep it secret from family and friends and no one seems to notice. 

I also find a lot of comfort in SI. Like “how bad could this situation possibly be? I can always ___”. It genuinely reframes my anxiety and makes things more manageable. 

Is any of that ok?"
892,Pain and Suffering,There is so much pain and suffering in the world. I don't know how everyone doesn't just crumble underneath the weight of it all. I find myself obsessing over other people's pain (as well as my own) and that tends to spiral me downward. Does anyone else relate?

I never did anything bad to anyone, but I can understand now that people who did mistakes, of course within limits, are still normal humans with feelings. People who made mistakes arent necessarily bad people.
I don't even know why that is on my mind. I even do a lot for my partner, but for some reason I am thinking of people who do mistakes.

I have been on medication but trying to taper off effexor which i didn't realize was as hard as it was. Since i have low grades now I feel like is it worth it if yk what i mean.

Im ranting not because i care for reasoning or care about being cared about, all of that is subjective, and honestly ive hated thinking about people caring about me it annoys me so much. But i legitametely have no one to talk to. My parents ive never been personal with, my brother and i dont get along, my friends from work are amazing, i just had a cook out with them yesterday, but i dont want to scare them away with my problems. Theyre not therapists for me to be running to them about my bullshit issues. My other friends are too involved in their own issues. My situationship of two years who is my ex who i was with for three years,(5years knowing each other) she had cheated on me, and i cant let go bcz im afraid i wont ever be sorta “loved” or used in that manner.

Im ranting because i feel the end is near, ever since i was about 16-17 i always knew id die young and i fully encourage it.

All of that, have kids, buy a house, get a mortgage, get old bullshit isnt for me. Ive just never been good enough, or felt good enough.

I was never picked first, i never had positive encouragement in school, i was never someones crush, and i always feel like people deep down are creeped out by me. I can tell by the look in their eyes, they think im some sort of criminal or vermin amongst them. My job is an office job and i feel myself just becoming a number that clocks in and out, ive never felt so alone and forgotten. And lately all my insecurities have amplified the feeling, ive never been one to do all that lame “man i feel suicidal” for me its like once its time its time. There is no beating around the bush, seeing if someone cares or crying for help. 

I wish there was a way i could fall off the face of the earth without having people worry about me, im really just another face in the crowd, another number, so overlooked, dont care about me afterwards i dont want you to. Just forget i exist, just erase myself from everyones memories, to never been looked for, to never be found, i dont want there to even be a single blood drop of me, i dont want there to be a cell of me, no ashes no nothing. No memories, no records, no recollections, not even my name or who i was. No funerals, no crying, no feeling bad, dont even feel sorry for me. 


All my life ive been looked at the same way, dont feel sorry for me, dont treat me like im less, even if i am, all my life has been living by other people with their judgement, their customs, their stupid norms, their stupid morals and codes, rules and regulations to how one should be, act, feel, or behave. Im tired of living my life on my knees, who says i must live under the feet of everyone like a cockroach? God? Society?. I am the byproduct of societys flawed ways, and yet im supposed to feel bad for being what society made me. 

I am not unhinged, i am perfectly normal functioning “member” of society. If you can even call it that, i am in every sense of the word a slave. 

A slave to a hyper industrialized society.
A slave to how my parents want me to be. 
A slave to my own ways.
A slave to how i must look. 
A slave to peoples thoughts about me.
A slave to thinking i should care.
A slave to always feeling this way. 

I dont know why i feel this way, but its the way ive always felt.

902,I don't deserve my meds,"I got raped at work today. Dragged into the bathroom by my hair. Gagged. Door barricaded. The guy got arrested. I got all the tests and hospital checks and whatnot. But I feel like somehow it was my fault. I feel dirty and disgusting and hating myself. I normally take about 7 meds at bedtime, but tonight I feel like I don't deserve them. Mainly because I feel like this was all my fault and if I had fought harder or done something (don't know what) I would have been ok. "
903,Empathy for apathy,Does anyone feel like however much empathy you have contributes to the idea that the more close people who don't care about you cause you more and more not to care about yourself?
904,Currently surrounded by both family and friends...,"...and I feel so fucking alone. Everyone is talking and having a good time, but I'm just...here. I know that they all care for me, but I can't help feeling like I'm just tolerated. Idk. Probably shouldn't even be posting"
905,TL;DC my life is a mess,"Im a F28. So I have a bachelor of writing and a masters in digital humanities but after covid my family convinced me to go into something that’ll earn me more money and get me a job. 

So I started an allied health degree.  I’m in my third year now and have two years to go. I’m struggling. I own a unit but can’t afford it. I’m working and studying full time and have zero savings. I’ve been in the red more times than I care to admit these past two years. 

My parents are helping a bit but they always go on about how they need to support me. And it just makes me feel so shitty because they are very intrusive and coddling without meaning to be. And like I’m 28 so I’m kind of over it. Other people my age are not relying on their parents or doing what they tell them to do as much as I am. 
I told my parents that I was thinking of taking a leave of absence from my study so I could work on my job and save money. And it would benefit my mental and physical health. But they don’t want me to take a break from study and they want me to finish my degree as soon as possible. 

I love my current job in aged care but the thing is my dream is to live and work overseas and publish my own book. 
I’ve been studying almost non stop for the past 10 years. I’m sick of it. 
I think about death sometimes and it’s become more prevalent in recent years. 
I went and studied in Italy for a month in January and it was the happiest and most free I had felt in about three years. 

I’m also bi and maybe Demi gender but I have to hide that from my parents. And it doesn’t help that this town is so small so there’s no community here. It’s just my parents. 

I need to start making my own decisions but I’m stuck. Idk what to do. I just have too much guilt and shame and I always fucking listen to my parents and let them control my life. 
And then I go home and lose myself on my phone and sleep and the cycle starts again. 
My parents say that it’s only two more years of this and then you’ll have your degree. But they don’t seem to understand that I can’t survive two more years of this. No matter how many times I tell them."
906,Strength isn’t everything ,Is anyone else sick of breaking down as hard as you try not to and the words out of anyone mouth anytime it happens is some version of “oh youre so strong” “the strongest person i know” or whatever what am i supposed to do with that do pwople really think it will help somehow or do they just not know what to say. I dont want to be strong i dont want to keep pushing based on strength alone i need support somehow idk why but lately those words have just become angering as a response and i want to know if im alone in that or if this is common?
907,feel like ill be dead in a month,"im 19 m

11 years of depression and suicidal ideation and im so close to quitting 

im suspected autism-Schizophrenia-aspd
ive tried forever to get diagnosed but no one cares. doctors refer me to places who dont contact.

young in life i listened to the voices did the things they told me to do and it was bad. i wasnt depressed because i didnt know what it was but once i was around 8 i realised and since then all i have wanted was death.

i never sleep ever i get maybe 3-4 nights of sleep if im lucky and even then i wake up countless times. no sleep makes everything worse. i was born with a bone disease because the shit mental health just wasnt enough. i havent had a day without pain in my body for years. i truly see no reason of living yet i still do? i just want to be fixed to be normal but that will never happen."
908,"Depressed friend not eating, not sleeping... how to help?","Hello. I would like to hear your suggestions about what to do about this friend.

She has severe depression diagnosed. Took meds and therapy for a couple months after a attempt, but stopped both recently (she is a young adult and her parents don't really support her).

Now, she is skipping all her meals. We bring her shakes and small granola/energy bars so she eats at least something while we see her at work. She doesn't want them. She has told us she just doesn't want it, and that she can't exactly put into words why. I have read that it may be either some kind of self-punishment with the general loss of apetite that depression brings.

What can we do?"
909,Feel like I’m destined to fail or worse,What sucks is I know exactly what I want to do. I’m currently in college on my second semester and I already feel like a useless piece of shit. I want to major in computer science but before I can even get started on those courses I gotta take a lot of other useless core classes like speech and history. They’re difficult for me to even do when I feel like they’re a waste of time. At this point I feel maybe I’m too dumb for college and computer science but I have no other choice I want to do that doesn’t involve all this college shit. Worst of all I’ve been getting dark thoughts that maybe I’m meant to be some criminal going around stealing things and hurting people. Im running out of options and starting to reach my breaking point. What am I supposed to do now?
910,im so depressed..,"i am 14 i been feeling depressed since i was 10 and been even worse lately I had a therapist for a little bit of grade 7 and eight it was online, but I did recently move from my hometown which did make it worse but at the same time a little bit better there’s not a lot of places where I could go for help around here online therapy didn’t help me my two uncles passed away a few months ago and I didn’t even cry I can’t even get myself to feel remorse about that and I lash out at people for no reason I also have really bad anxiety which doesn’t help it and I really don’t know what to do anymore.

once i did i tried to stop sometimes i slip. 
ive tried and tried to get help but no one listens 

im alone in this world yet i have people around me. ive tried end it a couple times but fails.

912,"I’m trying to quit Zoloft, but I feel like shit. [18F]","A few weeks ago I made the decision to taper off Zoloft (Sertraline). I’ve been decreasing with 12.5mg/week, I’ve gone from 125mg to 62.5mg.

I thought it was going well, until my anxiety started appearing more frequently and I relapsed back into SH again. I’ve also become more careless, taking unnecessary risks. I cried a few days ago, which is unusual for me. I don’t know if it’s just my yearly anxiety about the peak of certain infectious illnesses, or if it’s the Zoloft.

Maybe I just haven’t distracted myself enough like I usually do. Or maybe it’s seeing my friends get into relationships, while I’m stuck as the third wheel.

913,Su*cidal panic attack???? ,"So this happened a few days ago and I’m still processing 
I don’t really understand what happened

Eventually around like 6 am I called my mom and cried and talked to her till I calmed down and fell asleep, I felt better the next day but it’s just so weird I’ve never really felt that way

914,What is wrong with me,"The past couple of weeks have been just hard, Idk what to do. i can hardly get out of my bed, been crying a lot, and it feels like the happiness got sucked out of me. I have always been a happy person and laughing all the time, but now I can't even smile. I have cut comtact with the only people I can consider my true friends without a reason. Everything just feels wrong and I don't know what to do."
915,Why not? Here's my post. ,"I do not know what to think anymore, I don't know what to think of myself. I have a face, I have a body but they don't feel like they belong to me. I look at my hands and I see shapes made of flesh, not a person, not a man, just some bastardized machine. I feel as if I am just some construct, given a mind and forced to walk this earth with no clue as to what I was possibly intended for. 

What value does freedom have, when each choice we make is so insignificant? I don't feel pleasure in most things I do, truth be told. Food tastes unremarkable, music grows dull after the first few times listening to it. I've found myself having sex with other men, just for the sake of feeling something, anything that could possibly change my perspective. Ironic, considering I always had a distaste for it. It's unfulfilling, disappointing. 

Ultimately, I feel apathetic in regards to life. There was once a time where the thought of death genuinely excited me, albiet due to a martyr complex. I miss that, and honestly, dying for the sake of something I can say I cherish, even if it's for my own selfish wants.. well, it's a thought I find myself entertaining more often. "
916,Fictional Character ,"I have been struggling for maybe 3-4 years now... I don't want to be depressed anymore with this nonesene... I got too attached with a fictional character. 

This charater ended up with a different guy and not the main charater I've been rooting for for years. This bothered me so much that I couldn't focus in my workplace anymore. At some point I couldn't sketch at all cause with what happened to the character it really got stuck in my head. Sketching was my only way of relieving stress and I couldn't get that character out of my head. At times I would physically hurt myself, bang my head in the wall, or punch my face to forget about it. I just want to forget about it, you know? I'm just so tired of it. 

This shouldn't be a big deal cause I mean, yeah they're fictional and there are other bigger problems than this. Maybe its part of the writers story, and yet it really hit me. Because of that I couldn't enjoy other stories anymore because of this mentality. I just want to forget about it you know. Or mentally separate myself from fictional characters that I loved. Any advice you could give me?"
917,Blessing and a curse!,"I just wanted to share a little bit with you all about what's going on with me at the moment. I'm not sharing because I want you to feel sorry for me. I'm sharing because I want to raise awareness for others who are struggling as much as I am. I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, severe depression, anxiety, and PTSD. It's been six years since my diagnosis, but I've been suffering from these conditions since I was 13 or even younger. I've had good years and bad years, and I've been hospitalized in the past due to my suicidal thoughts. I've been doing really well until recently. Life has brought me so many ups and downs throughout the years. I have learned how to embrace this curse and blessing at the same time. It can be a curse because it can drop me to the ground and put me on a roller coaster that spins around and around and never stops. It's like having many demons fighting a war against each other, and it feels like it never ends and you can't see the light at the end of the tunnel. But it can also work as a blessing in the way that you can see how others struggle and you can relate to them. You can help them and be there for them, and it also makes you see the beauty in life because it's too short and can be gone in a blink of an eye. 
The reason I feel the way I do at the moment is not because of anybody hurting me or my job. About a year ago, I had surgery, and the doctor told me that my medicine intake might not affect me the same way and that I might have to have it adjusted here and there. It's been a year, and my medication hasn't been working like it should. I finally got it adjusted, and I hope it works and helps me out. I didn't realize how bad it was getting until recently. My thoughts were getting bad, and my demons were hunting me. The emotions of the roller coaster—the ups and downs, control—were all is coming back and hitting me hard. I couldn't see the light.
I am fighting this fight with all my might, and I have the support to battle it. The resources are the tools. I'm using them to make me stronger.
I want everybody to know that I'm thankful to have this support that I have. It has taken me years to accept support from people. I thought I was okay alone, but I was wrong. I want to say I am so thankful and blessed.
For the people that have been there for me, thank you so much for listening to me and putting up with me. I'm thankful to have a job that supports me, with amazing management that has supported me in their own ways. I have nothing but positive things to say about it, and the coworkers/friends there that have been a great support. P.S. I miss you all at the moment.
Now, if you guys wonder why I'm always smiling and trying to be happy and positive all the time, and always seeing the good in the bad, in trying to find a solution for people's problems and trying to help them out as much as I can, now you might understand me more. 
""Memento Vivere"" (Remember to live)
Like my tattoo says, which is a reminder to me every day.
Last but not least, thank you to my amazing fiancé.
Without you, I would be lost, more than I have ever been.
Thank you for putting up with me, supporting me, and not judging me.
I am accepting myself for who I am, with all my flaws. And to my beautiful daughters, thank you for accepting me with my flaws and not judging me, and for helping me when I need it most. I love you all with all my heart. You have guided me to the light."

I can't commit to anything, I don't care about showering or eating or literally anything. I'm fucking depressed all the time and I don't know how to fix it because therapy isn't helping. There's literally nothing you can do about apathy. I'm just a weak minded person who gives up easily, I don't have any fight in me and I don't think I ever had. I want to try, I want to build a life for myself but I just don't have the motivation to. I hide myself in my room all day because I think everyone hates me.

919,Want to diiiiie,"F*CK ME, F*CK MY LIFE, 19 F*CKING YEARS TO DO NOTHING. 

This isn’t the first time I’ve written in this group. But I realize what I am becoming and it makes me extremely sad. I became a drag at work (a job that I hate by the way). 

I am no longer interested in anything, I have no more desire, no more energy. I became unable to concentrate for more than 5 minutes. 

I became deeply embittered and egocentric. I abandoned myself. I didn't bother trying when I had the chance. From now on my life is hell because I am imprisoned in this body, equipped with a dysfunctional brain... 

I am really considering ending my life, but even that would be a failure. Running away from my current reality (once again). 

Only, I am extremely alone. Because now unable to socialize with anyone. Only my father remains present for me and I will make sure that he does not see my body if that is what worries you. 

I can no longer reason correctly. I get lost in my thoughts. In short, I'm already dead inside.

921,I'm not eating properly - At what point should I be seriously concerned?,"I live in a house with serval roommates, where we mostly keep to ourselves. I've got to the point where I don't venture outside of my bedroom during the day, as I don't want to encounter anyone. However, this makes basic things difficult. It's a challenge to access the bathroom, only daring to venture through the hallway like once or twice a day.

When it comes to food, I used to cook after midnight. I would eat breakfast food and a frozen meal. It was only 2 meals ""a day"", but I was getting mostly what I needed. Recently, when it reaches 12:00/1:00 am, I'm too tired to go downstairs and cook for myself. As I'm writing this, its been 48 hours and I've only eaten some chocolate bars readily in my room. I don't know if I'll reach the 72 hour mark without eating so much as breakfast.

924,The pain is horrible ,"Dear friends,

I want to express my gratitude to this community and to everyone taking the time to read this message. Today, I feel the need to share and seek some moral support. Three years ago, my mother tragically passed away from leukemia, leaving behind only my father, my little brother, and me. I've been grappling with the challenge of providing for my family while striving to be a supportive brother.

Until about six months ago, I was managing a large furniture store, when suddenly, I began feeling weakness in both of my legs. Initially, I didn't pay much attention to it and continued working. However, the weakness progressed rapidly, accompanied by severe fatigue. I depleted all my savings on numerous doctor visits and tests, only to be diagnosed with multiple sclerosis—a condition with no cure but can be managed with medication.

Here in Venezuela, affording such medication is beyond my means, and public healthcare is insufficient. My only hope lies in traveling to Spain to access better healthcare and manage my symptoms. Sadly, I lack the financial means to make this journey. I share my story in the hopes that it may resonate with you all and perhaps, in sharing, I may find strength.

Let us all cherish our health, for it is a precious gift that we often take for granted."
925,I hate my life,"I'm at my lowest right now.  I  don't really know what step to take in order to feel better or at least make my life a little better. I'm a 22 year old female and I'm currently struggling with depression and anxiety. Most of my problems are due to finances, I am unemployed and currently a student. The thing is, I am studying for a Masters degree in Agricultural sciences and one of the main reasons for continuing with this degree is that I want to save up as much as I can before I start any form of employment. My life can't seem to get some good news instead most of what I get is always bad. I'm really stressed right now because I am noticing how much I'll be struggling financially this year. I won't be able to get enough money to be able to take care of myself, talk less of saving. I have considered looking for a job but the partial scholarship that I have is strictly against it and I can lose it if they ever find out that I am employed. This situation has made me depressed and I am even thinking about quitting my studies although job hunting without a masters degree and experience is very difficult in my country. I've been crying throughout the past several hours and I don't know what to do.  I did try speaking to my boyfriend but he doesn't seem to understand and isn't helping at all. [ please excuse my English, it's not my first language]"
926,Reflecting on My Life: Dealing with Regrets and Moving Forward,"Life often feels like a game of chess, doesn't it? Every choice we make shapes our journey, and just like in chess, every move counts. But what about the ones we wish we could take back? 

As someone who's made my fair share of wrong moves, I'm seeking advice on how to cope and move forward. How do we make peace with the moves we've made when they seem to weigh us down?

There are times when I can't help but dwell on the choices I've made – the ones that led me here and the ones that didn't. It's like I'm stuck in a loop, wondering what could have been. Even though I believe everything happens for a reason, it's tough to shake off the regret.

My teenage years were a mess. I made so many mistakes – in friendships, love, school, you name it. And getting mixed up with drugs and alcohol? That only made things worse. Looking back, I can't help but think about the missed chances and the roads not taken.

I'm not alone in this, right? I bet plenty of us struggle with the same thing. How do you deal with knowing that life could have been different if you'd made different choices?"
927,My best friends try to mess up with my brain,"I(23M) have been struggling with depression and I get panicked easily. Since last year I have started to forget things quite quickly. I do not notice where I keep my things properly. My friends are aware about this situation but they aren't serious about it because we have been never too open about mental health with each other.
They intentionally hide my things and make me get panicked about it. They need to understand that I don't care about the things but I hate myself for forgetting things quickly and it is resulting in more self hate and suicidal thoughts. I don't blame them , we have been like this since we were kids, but I am not same anymore.
Yesterday they took one of my airpod, which is not even that important to me but I kept searching for it for an hour and I was so scared for no reason. I wish I could punch them in the face and tell them not to mess with my already messed up mind."
928,"Depressive symptoms that go away for a few hours, come back, go away, and so on","I’ve had this issue where I feel fine for a little (though there’s always a little dread, because I know that it’s not going to last) and then I feel depressed for a little, and then it just kind of cycles over. Each of these never last more than a day; it switches around every few hours, so I know that it can’t be depression, as I’ve read that it lasts for at least two weeks at a time (? This has been going on for a few months, but I never have an episode that lasts as long as that. I also don’t get manic or anything, so I’ve crossed BPD off the list. 

Does anyone have any similar experiences or input? I’m lost."
929,"I don't enjoy music anymore, among other things","The last time I can remember genuinely, (and frequently) enjoying music was .. 2021?

It’s so weird to say that you don’t enjoy music anymore. 

People look at you like you’ve got six heads.. every now and then I’ll get into something, but it’s so rare. And I can’t stand the feeling of listening to music with earphones anymore - it makes me feel detached from reality and then I start feeling certain unpleasant emotions, and I generally hate that. I don’t get it.

My emotional range since 2022 has basically been stress, anxiety, frustration, anger, irritability, helplessness, weariness.

I can’t stand the feelings of regret, shame, and nostalgia, so I avoid experiences that would trigger those. Unfortunately, music triggers that and so do most attempts at getting in touch with my old hobbies, or really any hobbies at all. It hits me with horrible waves of emotional pain and panic - then those feelings start a process where I realize that I don’t recognize myself anymore. I start to feel weird, old, and like I’m not dissimilar to the portrait of Dorian Gray, that slowly mutated and melted into something disgusting over time that people no longer recognize. I feel like a shell, like something repulsive and I feel repulsed by myself. But if I continue operating on a “business as usual”, avoiding-all-triggers wavelength, then I don’t have to acknowledge those feelings and it’s as if they don’t exist.

Does anyone else find that when they try to ""get back in touch with themselves"", they feel a sense of contempt for even bothering? In an, ""Oh really? You think that's going to work? Get over yourself"" kind of way?"
930,Another depressed person,"40m, 2 kids at 7yo, married for 10 years.. 

Seems like posts here do not get much responses but that is ok. I just want to write probably.. 

I am extremely lonely. We moved to Canada 6 years ago and even tho I did make friends from time to time they all moved to smaller cities and I lost contact with them slowly as we could not meet anymore. 

I do not trust my judgement anymore. I can't tell if I am in a horrible marriage or not for example. I can't tell if I am a good father or not. 

Every day is the same and same as in very boring. I do not get any compassion from anyone, including my wife. Maybe she hates me, I do not know. Maybe I am too busy with myself I also do not show her any compassion and do not even realize the love she has for me.

Last weekend I went out to get fruit juice for the kids, and instead of going to the usual nearby store I drove to a random far away one, just to spend some time with myself, to drive.. It took me more than an hour to come back, something that should have been 10 to 15 minutes most. 

She did not call. She did not even ask why it took me so long when I was back. I was wondering if she would call.  

I feel like nobody, not a single person cares about me. 

I love my kids. I would never leave them. I am wondering if we would be divorced by now already if we did not have kids. I do not know. Or I would have been alive. Seriously. I do not see any reason. 

I just want to save as much as I can for my kids in the next 10 / 11 years (if I can keep employed as it is getting harder and harder for me as I underperform due to being in such a state)  and just go find a grave or something, really. 

I enjoy nothing, I want nothing. I feel like life has ended. I failed. I do not make enough money. I will be renting for the next 50 years probably and it will probably a basement eventually - that if I can convince anyone to rent their basement to a weird divorced single man who is clearly going to die in his sleep or something. If I go back home I will just regret it more as I will feel a bigger failure. If I stay here we are pretty much broke. Lonely. 

When I talk to my wife about how I need more love and caring she just gets defensive. The problem is maybe she is right. I do not even know. Maybe no matter how much she cares about me I will ask for more. Maybe what I want is something else? Is it just me getting old and having a depression due to that? I do not know. 

I am tired all the time, burned out from work (I work in IT), there are layoffs, I am stressed, if I am laid off and go unemployed for a while oh my god I will feel even worse. 

Sometimes I feel I should have never had kids as I am a big failure clearly. I love them so much but the responsibility is so big. I can't just abandon them. And what am I going to do if I move out anyway? Like everything is going to be perfect all of a sudden? Life will be difficult for my wife too, something I do not want. 

I will stop now. I feel dizzy and numb.

932,Tired of my emotions,"Hi everyone lately I have broke up with my girlfriend and realized I'm lonelier than I think. It's been always like this for me I have many friends but I don't think it's possible for me to speak to them about my problems. I'm seeing a psychologist but it doesn't seem to be enough. I try to write things on my social media in a very shallow way like saying ""i feel bad lately"" but I feel very guilty about it afterwards. I don't felt understood and dont want people to think I'm whiny. In my own way I'm more mature than ever I can control my feelings it has always been a problem for me. Sometimes it was my anger or sadness that made me yell or cry in a situations I shouldn't. I wasn't able to act reasonable. I feel like an adult but now I can't found a relief. What is a healthy way of expressing our emotions. They are really tiring to live with.

933,Numb after Past Few Relationships,"I'm not sure what's going on, but I've recently broken up with someone that treated me the best that I've ever been treated, but didn't align with me goals-wise (there was no compromise). 

I broke up with him and feel almost nothing. The person before, I felt almost nothing after we broke up, but there was a lot of trauma i had already dealt with, with that person. The person before, I felt nothing for them eventually and I forget I even loved them. 

I can only feel sorrow when I'm incredibly drunk, and that was directly after the breakup. Now I feel nothing negative. 

I feel like I have some sort of fear of commitment, and that somehow muted my emotions. However, I don't show it during the relationship. I show my love very intensely in everything that I do. 

Feels like I can't have a long term relationship. "

I (15F) have an older sister, (17F) I’ll call Kay in this post. 

I love my sister, and she has depression but won’t get help for it. She’s having severe mood swings and lashing out at everyone in the family, me and my mother getting the brunt of it. She’s closing herself off, drowning herself in school work from the 3 AP classes she decided to take this year.
 
When Kay is happy, it’s all fine. She’s smiling and we laugh and get along. But even then, we have to walk on eggshells. If we say one wrong thing or bring up one bad memory, she shuts down and cries. She doesn’t listen to reason, and she won’t accept any apologies or consolation. But she does this right back to us. Being teenagers, we often roast each other, and what drives me insane is that she tears me apart, and it hurts really bad, as she brings up bad past memories and feelings. But I say one comment like her long hair clogs the drain a lot, and she cries and shuts down. 

 But when she goes through an episode, which is happening more often, She is super sensitive and cries at things we say in passing, when we don’t mean any harm or she took it a different way. She locks herself in her room for hours at a time, and either scrolls or does homework. And again, not accepting apologies or consolation. 

I love her so much. And I know that she’s really going through it. And I just want to be able to help her get through it. But I’m continually getting abused by her because of her mental states. How do I help her without getting hurt, physically or mentally? "

947,Guilty of blocking & ghosting people you love? Please 🙋‍♀️,"Hey everyone,

I'm wondering how common it is to block AND ghost people you love, who love you, who are low-pressure (or at least try to be).  At first, I don't feel like responding to people even though they're just letting me know they care. And eventually, I have to block them so I don't feel guilty that I'm not responding to them. If I can't see them texting me, I can't feel bad about not responding.

Do you ever come out of this phase? How long did it take to feel comfortable talking to people again? How hard was it to reach back out? Was anyone angry with you? Is there anything anyone could have said you help you feel better, or do you think the block was worth it?

I think (and am hoping) I am dealing with Seasonal Affective Disorder and this will end as summer nears, but I worry it won't. It started in November. So it will have been a while since I cut people off.

Thanks\~!"

949,Venting,"So…99% I have no fucking idea what’s going on in my brain. One minute I have the strongest urge to leave this life & all the struggles and sadness that comes with it. Then the next, I feel optimistic-“light at the end of the tunnel” kind of thinking. And I don’t get it. Therapy is a fluke. The ones I’ve been looking for don’t accept my insurance (and I’m broke) and the last psychiatrist I had was shitty…prescribed me Lexapro before even meeting with a therapist. I’ve been applying to jobs and it feels like they are all fucking against me, I am sooo tired of hearing “we’re not hiring” or literally hearing nothing back after applying and calling. My family used to support me financially but I guess lately shits hit their pockets too so I don’t ask anymore and I’ve been trying to just do it on my own. The repetitiveness of school, coming home, looking for a job, then occasionally doing schoolwork is driving me crazy. I have a boyfriend but I literally can’t even put my full 100% into our relationship cause I feel like a loser to the fullest. As a psych major I somewhat understand what’s going on, but once the depression hits…it hits and I want to kms genuinely. This might be TMI but idc, I literally was even thinking about turning my life to sex working but part of me must still hold myself to a different standard so I don’t know. I feel so stuck and reading everyone’s posts, I know I’m not alone, but that makes it worse imo. I literally constantly question if I’ll get better and I just don’t think I will.

She knows this, but she is refusing professional help.

952,I'm just on autopilot these days,"I have been alone since my mother left to go visit her grandkids abroad. I never really felt lonelinesss like this before since I'm on vacation and don't really have many peoole I can hang out with.

For the  last week, I've been having chest pains that feel like someone is poking my heart when I breathe. At times, the pain rings throughout my upper left side. If it's not chest pain, it's been migraines, ear infections, depressive episodes or just feeling fatigued  all day. 

Besides that, I have not really had anyone to speak to. I've reached out to vent but just get one word replies if they reply at all. Any attempts to hang out have been failures. If I don't message anyone to chat, my only conversations will be persons who need to vent or want me to be their shoulder to cry on without returning the favour.

Met a girl who I was interested in. First time I've wanted to spend time with someone but my advances always seem stifled. It's either feigned interest to not be rude or uninterested replies so that's dead before it even started. I don't know why I even waste the energy sometimes. 

It's a shame that I can't even talk to those around me. I just have to wallow in my thoughts until something  wakes me up, talk to my online friend who lives on another continent (who I can't keep dumping onto), or  make a desperate attempt to have conversations with ""friends"" where I just end up being spoken over or ignored.

And due to all this pressure to do well (I’m failing most subjects) and everything at school, I just feel like there’s no hope for things getting better. My mum tells me that having a job is much worse than going to school so that’s why I should make the most of it, but I’m depressed at school, so is there even anything good about life? anything that I can be excited for? I don’t really know what I’m asking for, maybe tips on how to feel better towards life. I know most people on here go to or have been through school and I feel like everyone else seems to be so happy at school and I can’t see why.

Fluoxetine-Prozac

Mirtazapine

I don't even like doing drugs even though I have tried them because they are a waste of time.

No recreational drug use
Prescribed Fluoxetine for GAD and depression

My husband was diagnosed with Flu A this past week (Tuesday 2/20) and this has seemed to kick off a depressive episode and I am just looking for any and all advice. He was already dealing with some stress from a new job he started and everyday he’d come home from work he just seemed so down, overwhelmed, and depressed. But eventually it would subside. Ever since having the flu he has been in this state that he can’t really describe but he is just feeling an overwhelming amount of anxiousness and depression wash over him and nothing seems to make it go away. He can barely eat, get out of bed, get out of the house, or make sense of what he is feeling. He has taken Ativan a few times but it does not seem to help anything other than make him fall asleep. I would just like an understanding of what could be going on, could this be a depressive episode that is lasting? He had a couple of panic attacks in between, but I understand those do not last days. 

He just finished his last dose of Tamiflu yesterday (Sunday 2/25) and he was also prescribed Azrithromycin and Methylprednisone on Friday (2/23), but his symptoms began before starting the antibiotics and steroids. 

It seems anytime he gets really sick he enters into this state and it will last days if not weeks. Could there be something more going on unrelated to anxiety and depression? 

He has an appointment with his psychiatrist tomorrow. Is there anything that can provide him immediate relief? He has been missing work and just feels scared and doesn’t know what is going on."

Social media, especially Youtube, Instagram has become a place of self-hatred for me.

I just can't deal with all these opinions and all this information overdose, the constant thought stream and thinking is just too much.

I don't want to participate in this fake world anymore.

Screens are polluting our minds and our ability to function as humans. 

We really need to snap out all of it this crap.

Call me crazy, label me as weird. It doesn't matter to me anymore.

I'm done with this world.

974,I don't want to visit School anymore.,"
I (m16) have been diagnosed with Depression at the age of 12. Antidepressants are not an option, since they clash with my other Meds.

I cant seem to talk to People anymore, or maintain my social life in any way. I am **extremely** forgetful because of my ADHD, so i mostly even forget to text up the friends, that i have left.

I find myself not being able to talk in school anymore, as if raise the word for even a split second, someone either laughs, or people rip on me for speaking.

I transferred schools (at age 15) because of Teacher-sided racism, discrimination and disadvantage. I was never the kind of unsocial person, but when i had to get used to a new environment and new people everything changed.

I knew a couple of people there, because its a very small town i live in and most of the people going to the Gesamtschule (German middle school) also went to my Primary school.

I told myself to make a new start for myself and introduced myself to my new classmates. I never wsnted to start crossing with someone or be mean in any way. 

That apparently wasn't enough tho because it only took 2 weeks for comments about my looks (Im Half haitian and Half Moroccan so i have darker skin and short Curly hair) So they were mostly about hoe my hair looks and that i didnt shave my sides. So i did that, and more comments were made. 

I dont know what to do. Today someone snatched my phone out of my hands while unlocked, and deleted all my Photos and Apps somehow. I was on the verge of suicide because (some were directly stating i should) i dont feel like i have a Place anywhere. 

How do i make it stop? Please help me

975,Depression is getting so bad my eyes are closing by themselves now,"I dont even feel tired right now (though usually I do), yet I feel so goddamn sad my head is nodding forward and eyes are closing and I can barely keep them open. I pbysically FEEL the complete lack of dopamine in my system, my brain cannot sense a single particle of it floating around in my system. And I dont even know what im depressed about anymore. Ive been this way for so many years now i dont even remmeber how to be genuinely happy anymore, and now this emptiness is the new normal. I'm scared of going to the doctor, because I dont want to become medicated. I dont want to be dependent on a drug, yet I started vaping which I previously looked down upon. I dont want antidepressants, but it's the only thing that could probably help me i dont know. I can barely type, I can't see the keayboard anymroe."
976,I need help creating a daily routine. I'm home alone all day and have a very limited income.,"There is nothing more depressing than waking up almost every day knowing that you're going to spend the day alone.  I don't have a car.  I have a treatment team that visits me 2-3 times a week and I go to a substance abuse group weekly.  Most weeks, one of my visits is from a therapist.

My family is very supportive, but I can't and don't expect them to work to fill that void.  That's on me.  My parents live almost an hour away, and most weeks, they pick me up on Friday morning and take me home Monday morning.  They are so incredible!  But they have lives of their own too.

I really would love to get myself into a routine.  I always loved having a routine as a child and through college.  I like to know what to expect and being productive.  But I live alone and not near anyone that I could socialize with.  I have very limited income, which makes things a little more complicated.

Please, make suggestions of what I could include in my daily/weekly routines!  Also, I have been having panic attacks since Thursday.  I would really love to find someone to chat with online.  Someone who knows what I'm going through, even if only slightly, would assuage me so greatly.

Thank you for reading and have a great day!  :)"
977,Make it stop.,"I don’t wanna feel my heart hurt anymore. All the good that I did always go down the drain and goes unappreciated. I am tired of trying my best. Someone, please make my heart stop beating. I’m just tired of everything. It would’ve been better for everything to disappear, including me."
978,"I need a “reason” to have low moods, and if I don’t, it’s time for unsolicited advice.","I’ve been suffering with chronic depression and anxiety ever since I was a child, like many of you here, and have been struggling hard to survive for the last 15 years. I’m resigned to the fact it’s always going to be around, but I’ve taken steps to ‘manage’ my condition by exercising, trying to sleep good, trying to improve my eating habits (sometimes unsuccessfully), etc. I sometimes have good times where I’m content and moments where I’d say I’m even ‘happy’ when I achieve something.

But depression has affected every aspect of my life, I was academically bright, did really well in my studies despite my struggles up until I got to college where I couldn’t handle it anymore. I begged my parents to let me take a year after I basically just scraped a pass in one of my A-Levels (which was a first for me as I was always a straight A student), but they keep me running on the hamster wheel to basically ‘ship me off’ to a husband (that’s what I was always told growing up) as if I’m checking boxes so they can say they’ve done their duty. I pushed myself through university, but couldn’t do any more after reaching my second year of undergrad. I, despite everything, braved taking a break and deferring my studies. 

They made my life hell during the one year I was at home, even though I was job hunting and even got my driving license (with my own money) but they treated me like I was the biggest failure ever and I was now a burden forever according to them. I’m not allowed to forget that I ‘dropped out’, I now have a law degree and currently doing my masters degree, but it’s still the ‘don’t you dare skip uni’, ‘don’t you dare drop out’ — I want to say fuck you, I asked you for help at my lowest moment and you basically told me you’d help me kill myself and that I had no right to be depressed and that I was ‘too sensitive’. My mother is a narcissist and she has to make everything about her, so I’ve never been allowed to talk about my feelings openly. She’s never once helped me with my homework as a kid, she told me on numerous occasions that she wished I was never born even though I’m the one child out of my siblings who does the most to please her. She makes a big deal out of any time I tell her ‘no’ and try to draw boundaries.

Basically, years of emotional abuse, controlling behaviour and even financial abuse and I’m desperately trying to recover from it all. It feels impossible to detach my self-worth from my ‘achievements’ in life.

And my lowest lows still come back, sometimes without any obvious trigger. Sometimes I’m fine and then I randomly crash, but I try to function or distract myself from it until I’m ‘okay’ again. I don’t let myself stay in bed anymore, but I can’t walk around and laugh or smile. I need to feel my emotions and process them so that I can bounce back. But my sister who- despite suffering similar things in the same household- won’t let me. She thinks she’s helping when she tells me to ‘get over it’, ‘just go and exercise’, etc. She has a degree in fucking psychology but she’s got no empathy. Even when we’re talking about topics like homelessness and victims of domestic violence (which is sort of my field since I worked with them for about a year), she thinks that it’s their own fault they can’t ’get out’. Hello? Tone deaf much? We’re both still stuck at home with our narcissistic mother because it’s very difficult to move out with the current economy.

I don’t even ask for her advice, I’ve told her multiple times that it’s dismissive of my feelings and that it really upsets me when she criticises me for being low. She refuses to apologise which I don’t even fucking care about, but I wish she’d just leave me alone and mind her own business. I don’t even tell her I’m sad or complain, she sees me sitting alone or gaming and starts with ‘your problem is…’. Then feels justified and has this sort of haughty expression on her face when I get pissed off or roll my eyes at her.

Let me feel, please. It’s not your business."
979,My depression & partner’s grief. I really need help.,"I am struggling, big time. 

For the past 4 months, I have been going through an awful depression. My doctor felt that the medication I was on was no longer working so he suggested a change. We changed about 6 weeks ago. At this point I’m not sure if the dose is wrong, the medication isn’t a good fit or the medication is making me worse. I have an appt at the end of this week with my doctor and also an appt to see my therapist in a few days (I’ve been going weekly for about the past 2 months. Also changed therapists because I don’t think the first was the best fit anymore for a multitude of reasons).

This is really the first time my partner of 3 yrs has seen me go through something like this. (He is 32, I’m 30, female). Honestly it’s been about 5 yrs since anything like this has happened. No real trigger. He’s been beyond lovely and supportive. Very patient and supportive, great communicator. As wonderful as he’s been, I am still really struggling with a lot of guilt for being so needy and emotional, really beating myself up and feeling irritable. 

About 2 weeks ago, his mom died unexpectedly. It’s been devastating to me to see him in pain and he is in deep, deep pain. He was super close with his mom. I am a natural fixer and so I jumped into action. He went home first (his family is about a 2hr plane ride away) and I came up 2 days later. When I was at home deep cleaned the house, set up all his favorite things, made a bunch of freezer meals etc because I wanted him to come back to a cozy comforting home. When I went up to see his family, the experience was very lovely. I felt like I was able to support his dad and sister and I feel like having things to do and people to take care of gave me a sense of purpose.

And now we are back home, and the depression is back and the grief is really settling in for my partner. I feel like there’s a lot I can do to support him still but I feel fragile. I can’t separate when he gets frustrated or irritable or takes something the wrong way from his grief and my depression. I keep having these waves of feeling like I’m doing everything wrong, I have no idea how to support him, and like I’m making things worse. I’ve been trying to compartmentalize my own depression and I think it’s made me colder and he is picking up on it. When I opened up about how I was feeling he was so sweet and comforting and that made me feel even worse because no one is supposed to be comforting someone else when they just lost a parent. 

I’m angry with myself I don’t know why I can’t get my shit together. I’m sad and embarrassed. The tiniest part wants to just leave so I don’t drag him down further. I won’t actually leave. He is the love of my life. We planned on getting engaged this year (I’m sure that’ll get pushed back that’s fine, not the point. Just a reference for how serious we are). But I need some advice on how the fuck to get through the next 4 days until I can see my therapist because I feel fucking horrible and useless and like he’d be better off without me. "
980,slight vent i guess,"i have been struggling with depression since elementary school i think, but last four years it has been worse. i was institutionalized with ocd during the initial covid outbreak, struggled there and got abused by the psychiatrists, afterwards i loosely managed to do schoolwork for two years while barely existing, like, i had fun and an ocassional chuckle here and there, but i wasn't really happy i think. afterwards last year i decided wrong on an extracurricular class selection and failed the grade because i couldnt handle it and a long-term paper and i was threatened i wouldn't be able to repeat the school year on my original school. my mom, who abused me but realized her faults and mistakes, managed to get me transferred to a different school, however since last september, i haven't been to school because i couldn't just bring myself to it, now my mother and i managed to get some sort of accomodation for me but it's still not enough and i just don't know how to make people leave me alone, i just don't see the point in school (education is great but just the mere concept of shuffling around and doing mandatory tasks instead of actually learning just makes me give up on it), i understand i should just ""work it through"" and get the graduation diploma but for what exactly? i'm unable to work and i just can't. my mom wants me to somehow pass the class but just thinking about studying and working makes me physically sad and dead inside."
981,Thinking of letting go...,"Idk what else to do. I feel like just giving up nothing that i do seems to be good enough. I always get reminded of all my failures,mistakes and flaws. Feel like I'm just here without purpose, never had luck finding love and I'll probably end up dying alone. Feel like ending it will be easier no one cares. They say to talk to someone but i feel like i have no one that i can actually relied on. And i also don't wanna to be the dead brother or cousin. But letting go seems easy than to continue with this pain.... "
982,I feel like killing myself (17F),"I’m too pussy to do it. But I fantasize about it. I already self harm as a way to cope, my dad took away my box cutter and all it did was make it harder to cope and it’s making me feel way more suicidal where as when I was still able to cut I’d just do it and it would help with the suicidal tendencies a lot. 

Killing myself would be an escape for me, my life has been hell for the past year or two. I’m 17F and I’ve been bullied at school by old friends, I’ve always had a hard time going to school because of my anxiety and lack of motivation to go. And I basically dropped out as of recently. I’m currently trying to get my GED but I still struggle with going. I haven’t gone for a month… I have a severe fear of abandonment and losing my friends was one of the most triggering things for me. Especially once they started harassing me at school the second we quit being mutuals. 

I’m not sure how to write everything this is going to be very messy I just want to rant about everything fucked in my life right now 

My mom died a few months ago. I tried waking her up to see her lifeless stiff, and cold body. I have vivid flashbacks of her body whenever I slightly get triggered into thinking anything related to parents or mothers. I loved my mom but I recently learned that I’ve been in denial my whole life, I never realized it but she was a druggie almost. She’d had a past with addictions, alcohol, drugs… and she had been prescribed pain meds and she had basically got hooked on them. When I was younger I noticed how she’d crush her meds up to cook them and inject them into herself for more effect. And she’d do this constantly. I never really noticed or admitted to myself what she was doing until after she was already dead. I was young and naive. I was blind. 

As of now I just procrastinate in fear every morning I wake up. Going to school is triggering and scary for me. Waking up to hear my dad ask if im going or  not. Just to hear his disappointed sigh. I’ve been a shut in on and off for the past 4 years. Ever since the harassment at school had basically started. I love my dad but he yells and makes me feel unsafe sometimes. And threatens to take away the things I love as punishment for something he doesn’t like.

I have a loving boyfriend. I’ve seen him a total of 3 times now, (we are long distance) I’m from Quebec and he is from Washington state. I love him so much he’s basically the only thing keeping me alive and only thing that’s kept me going this far. But it’s hard. Trying to imagine a future where we live together- especially with how I’m not going to school right now. And currently going through severe mental issues. My fear of abandonment really gets triggered when ever I’m without him. I have to know what he’s doing or where he is- I’m just a huge burden. I don’t know how he can love me.

Im not sure what else to explain this is my first time posting on Reddit. If anyone has questions I can reply."
