1,Prom fomo and why I got it.,"So my bf (18y/o male) went to senior prom without me(18y/o enby), Which doesn’t sound really bad we find out that I have crippling anxiety. But it’s the fact that he didn’t even tell me he was going to prom after us talking about going to prom together. The thing is for the last past week I’ve watched all my friends go to prom I wasn’t sad I wasn’t mad I was excepting I was happy for them until I saw my bf ex gf post about them at prom (no together tho). Me and my bf are in a group chat together of all our middle school friends, and all day he’s been talking about how he’s getting ready for something I thought maybe the guys were having a meet up, note he was getting ready for prom without saying he was getting ready for prom because he didn’t tell me he was going to prom still. I kind of wanna leave my group chat now but I know I can’t I’m graduating high school in two weeks and they’re all I have I guess my FOMO has already happened. But some advice on how I handle the situation would be good.

2,A Letter to those who don't have FOMO,"Dear Friend Who Doesn’t Suffer from FOMO,

Your mental attitude surprises me. You are unaffected when you go on Snapchat and see the stories that your friends post when they are at a party without you. The same is true when you go on Find My Friends and you see two of your best friends together while you are at home, alone. You don’t feel like you are missing out on anything special and instead just passively watch, not letting anything get to your head. Maybe you are an introvert and being at large gatherings makes you uncomfortable. I understand how you can find happiness being alone, binging your favorite show.

FOMO, also known as fear of missing out, is a word that eats at my mental health, but not yours. FOMO is defined as the anxiety brought about when you feel like you are missing out on experiences or knowledge. I am someone who always wants to be in the know and wants to be included. Even if I am unable to go somewhere because I have a conflict, I still want the invite. It’s important to me to feel like I am wanted somewhere, while you can simply appreciate the fact that your friends are having fun.

Given today’s culture, I am genuinely surprised that you don’t suffer from crippling FOMO. Social media has perpetuated FOMO. When people go out, they attempt to produce FOMO in others by posting on social media. Maybe you understand better than I do that social media can be deceiving. When I am out and someone I am with posts a video, it can seem like the most fun thing ever, when it often really isn’t. Plenty of research has shown the negative effects of social media on mental health. You see other people looking like they are having the time of their lives, and you aren’t.

I really wish that I could just look at something I am left out of and not care. I wish that not being included in something didn’t leave me with terrible anxiety and feeling somewhat depressed. This feeling is consistent with my tendency to overthink things. Something small often becomes an ordeal in my mind as I construct reasons as to why I am alone or not invited, such as no one wants to hang out with me. This mindset becomes frustrating when someone I always hang out with, or used to, has moved to only hanging out with one of my other best friends.

I recognize that we all struggle with problems and hardships in our lives. I’m not saying that just because you don’t have severe FOMO your life is perfect. Instead, it’s just easy for me to imagine that your life is a little better than mine. I am sure that overcoming an obstacle or struggling with being an introvert is difficult to go through as well. With everything going on in our lives, I admire your ability to be independent. I wish I could happily spend my Friday nights alone without the feeling of FOMO.

One suggestion you might give me to overcome my FOMO is to look at technology and social media less. I know that I need to take a step back from technology, but that is easier said than done. I am simply too obsessed and addicted to technology. To cut technology and social media out of my life is nearly impossible. Another suggestion that I think is more feasible for me is to change my focus. Rather than focusing on not being there, should I be happy for my friends and look forward to being at the next event with them?  Is that your attitude? I understand I need to see things in an optimistic way as opposed to being jealous.

I know you don’t have similar feelings to me. But, my hope is that you can help change my mindset so that I don’t constantly experience FOMO. I hope this letter finds you well, and please help me beat FOMO.

Best,

Abby"

5,Always feel left out,Anyone else always feel alone? I’m an only child and always felt left out but as I get older it just gets more intense. My dad just died & my family has only grown even more distant. I constantly seeing people on socials all out and about having fun & I never really get invited places. I always seem like the last option. They’re like “oh let’s hangout soon!!” And I’m never thought of to be invited. Idk I just always feel so left out. Especially on weekends… anyone else?
6,a bad case of fomo,"I just fount out. Everyone had fun without me, I started to panic extremely bad. Went outside in the pitch dark, felt unsafe, ran back inside and continued panicking at the thought of others having fun without me. 
I couldn't even study without feeling like I was going to throw up."

9,"Anyone have ""covid fomo?""",I feel like I'm missing out on so many social things because covid won't allow us to. I know everyone is on the same boat but every passing day without no end to covid is more time I can't do things and have to put stuff on hold. I just feel like one day I'm gonna wake up old when it's over and be super bitter that I missed out on certain things in life . Certain things I won't be able to get back.
10,how to deal with fomo,"Hey everyone!! i've been dealing with fomo ever since all my friends started attending offline classes, except me ofc. they talk about it in group chats, in calls, this happened, that happened,  i feel so left out.  


i've been balling my eyes out every school night, i can't focus on online classes because i just sit through them thinking about what the others might be doing in school, this sucks.  


please help me out."
11,Fiscally conservative makes me FOMO.,"I am afraid to spend money and I'm starting to think I don't have a life. I worked as an essential worker and was fortunate to save quite a bit of money during quarantine. In addition to work, I received scholarships from my university and have been saving a decent amount within a year (\~$40,000). While everyone has been partying, eating out and living their life since safety measures have eased out, I'm still resistant towards spending too much. I want to save for a car and have a safety net when I graduate. I want to hopefully save enough money to start investing and possibly put a down payment on a house. 

 My friends say I'm too young (24) to worry so much about money, but I don't like spending my money on nails, makeup, concerts, raves, expensive restaurants etc. like other people my age do. My mind is very future oriented, and I feel like my sacrifices of saving money now will pay off later on. I'm also pretty introverted and enjoy reading, watching TV/youtube, making bracelets and working with other hobbies that allow me to stay home and not spend so much. But, there's this constant FOMO that's always playing in the back of my head because I see others my age doing so much outside (and spending so lavishly). 

Does anyone else feel this way? For those older and have more wisdom, am I too frugal for my own good? I would also love to hear how others have amazing experiences while keeping their wallets in tact."
12,Never knew I had fomo but here i am,"Yesterday was the farewell of my 10th grade and i couldn't go to it because my mom thinks meeting friends outside once a month is too much or something and most of the friends i care about went had fun took pics and i feel so shit and sad right now even tho i am, or was introverted and this sucks"
13,i self sabotage when i have fomo,"i have to quarantine til the 13th, therefore i’m alone and missing out on everything my friends/significant other are doing … it’s mostly with relationships when it’s pretty bad , i feel depressed and alone and not wanted and left out, so the most logical thing to do according to my stupid brain is distancing myself and pushing everyone away. I’m home and my boyfriend is at wildwood (beach) with his fam and i can’t go bc my mom and sis have covid and i have to tend to them (it’s been 5 days ) yesterday is was pretty bad i stayed in my room the whole day i didn’t even eat bc of how sad and alone i felt and i self sabotaged , i posted my ass on instagram knowing it would get a reaction of out my boyfriend (it certainly did, he said he didn’t feel respected and was super mad ) so i woke up today and checked his location .. he’s at the beach so now i don’t want to text him at all today bc he’s having the time of his life and i don’t want to interrupt /bother his perfectly fun day. and now i pity myself and punish my self by not eating/sleeping the whole day bc i feel alone . maybe this is me being emotionally dependent, maybe it’s not fomo"
14,im fucking confused,
15,Is it me or is it my FOMO???,"Am I only one who has not made any meaningful friendships in college after months of online college.
Like I see my college mates tagging each other in FB and writing long ass bday posts as if they have known each other their whole life!!!!
NGL it kind of makes me feel left out....and let's not even get into the groups that get formed!!!

21,Why can't I make people talk back to me?,"I'm a good person, I'm nice, I'm attractive, I'm smart, I'm respectful, I'm calm, I'm funny, I'm hardworking, I'm positive, I'm not awkward, I'm not weird, I'm not stupid, I learned things, I know how to be to people, but I'm an introvert, I don't talk to people, and I never used to, I'm 18, and now I'm trying talking to people, I put myself out there, I'm giving anyone my approval, it's not working, I am not doing anything wrong, but I don't know what it is, I'm showing interest, but people aren't, no one is, this is part of me not getting what I want, I'm trying.. what am I supposed to do?"
22,FOMO life,I’m 20 and I’ve never been clubbing and I don’t have a proper group of friends I can go out with and I have strict parents that don’t let me stay over at friends houses. I see everyone around me gaining many memories and living their lives and having fun. Every time someone tells me about a road trip they went on with their friends or something fun they did I get this nagging feeling In my chest call it jealousy but I just feel like I would’ve really enjoyed that experience too. I feel lonely most of the time and I just can’t get over this feeling. Does anyone have any helpful advice?
23,The Fear of Missing Out FOMO,
24,Why do I have this fear of missing out?,"Im going on 28 soon and sometimes I feel like I missed out on so many opportunities. Yes, I know im young but still. Like there are so many opportunities out there and youre not going to see them anymore. Here's a good example, imagine you really wanted to meet Stan Lee (creator of Marvel), but now that he's dead that opportunity is gone. Or even Larry King, he's gone too. I have some goals in mind myself, I'd love to visit the UK, there are other famous people id like to meet too. I would especially love to meet Alison Brie (Mad Men, Community). She seems so nice and friendly. Or even Maisie Williams from Game of Thrones. I also like Betty White, now imagine meeting her before she passes.THESE opportunities im talking about. There are once in a lifetime opportunities that youre never going to get, and yet I hear ""youre young, you have your whole life ahead of you"". I could have met Stan Lee, that would've been a great experience. Whoever said ""good things come to those who wait"" should end up like something from a Tarantino film."
