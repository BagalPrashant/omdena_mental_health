My father is taking a trip with some his buddies, which of course I\u2019m so happy for him because he deserves a break. He\u2019s also my best friend. We call and text every day so when I called him while he was on a long drive I expected an answer because he\u2019s always near his phone. Always. Even if he doesn\u2019t answer, it will still ring but this was going right to voicemail. Instant panic attacks. My head is saying they got into a car accident or just some other really horrific and terrible thoughts that he had died and I didn\u2019t answer his text this morning because I was doing homework so I was like oh my gosh like I didn\u2019t even get a chance to talk to him before he left. I called him 4 times and as I\u2019m in tears he calls me and of course nothing is wrong. He turned off his phone to save the battery. He asked if I was okay because it sounded like I was crying, which I was, but I lied and said no of course I\u2019m fine. Why do I do this to myself? My head just immediately plays out the worst scenario in literally every part of my life. As soon as we got off the phone i was like hyperventilating. Now im thinking did I say \u201clove you\u201d before we got off just in case something does happen? Which of course I\u2019m sure I did but I\u2019m just such a mess. Has anyone else gone through this? \n\nI don\u2019t just do this with him it\u2019s with all my friends and family. And of course I understand how crazy life gets I\u2019m a nursing student I absolutely understand it\u2019s normal not to text someone back right away or always answer a phone call it\u2019s just these crazy invasive thoughts that I can\u2019t get rid of.  This week has also just been really rough in general so I think I\u2019m just really in my head and overwhelmed. I\u2019m so sorry if this was a lot but thanks for listening anyway. I hope everyone has a great weekend :)",

                "body": "So there are a few reasons. \n\n1. You don\u2019t die if you stop a SSRI suddenly - you feel pretty bad and the emotional state it can send you to alone can potentially cause serious consideration and attempts on your life, but physically you will not die if you suddenly quit your Prozac for example. This isn\u2019t so much the case for medications also used to control seizures - benzodiazepines for one. \n\nAside from alcohol, benzodiazepines are the only major abused substance that causes death from withdrawal alone. Opiates won\u2019t, amphetamines won\u2019t. \n\n2. The abuse potential of benzodiazepines is really high. Even if you have no prior history of abuse, it can and does happen to people. I think this is best demonstrated by the crazy level we prescribed opiates just 25 years ago. Most of the people who were put on the medication never had a history of abuse. The abuse also correlates extremely high with: \n\n3. You build a tolerance *fast* and that tolerance doesn\u2019t wane for years if ever. Once you need to go up in dosage of a benzodiazepine, you will likely never be able to see an effect at a lower dose again. People use more and more and more to get what they need. \n\n4. Along with the potential dangers of withdrawal if you abuse benzodiazepines, even routine use of a lower dose will lead to a point you need them, or else your anxiety will slingshot the other way due to the physical dependency on them. It leads to a belief of \u201cthese are the only things that help my anxiety.\u201d when they are likely causing your anxiety solely because you missed a dose. If you drink coffee daily for example, and you miss a day because you\u2019re busy, you feel sick right? You get a headache, some people get nauseous, it\u2019s a not-so-great day. This is a reaction to a missed dose of something your body looks for at scheduled intervals. \n\n5. Anxiety responds really well to treatments like therapy. Therapy combined with certain medications shows some more positive impacts but anxiety disorders are some of the most responsive to therapy. That doesn\u2019t mean therapy doesn\u2019t suck, that doesn\u2019t mean that the anxiety at the moment isn\u2019t extremely painful and debilitating at times, it just means it might not be worth jumping on that quick fix might hinder long-term relief. Think of it like physical therapy for a broken leg. Pain killers and a cast are necessary for a bit but you have to get that leg stronger again in the long run. \n\nbenzodiazepines are great for an emergency. They are awesome for that terrible panic attack for example, but daily relief is best found in other ways for a more permanent solution.",

Doctors don't want to be held responsible if they do an autopsy and find their prescription in your system, even if it wasn't the cause of the s\\* but a mixing of other substances commonly used recreationally with benzos. \n\nAlso some practices have a rule that says less than five percent of patients can be prescribed a benzo or an opiate. This has to do with state audits and if a particular doctor puts up red flags by having too high of a patient count on benzos, the state can start digging into why and the person can be fired. \n\nSome people need them. Most people don't. SSRIs are being pushed because they aren't considered addictive and although some are \"black label\" drugs (relating to increased suicidality in some demographics) they aren't considered a concern for addiction nor for intentional/unintentional death. \n\nThe effects of benzos can be swift. Run out and you'll be sick as a dog and possibly seize. Only anti-depressant that gave me seizures was Vibryyd, which was a known side-effect, and I don't think it was an SSRI.",

This approach may prevent the development of tolerance and allow for the benefits at a low dose without escalating the dosage.\n\nHowever, with daily usage, tolerance can quickly develop, necessitating a continual increase in dosage. It's essential to consider potential withdrawals, which can be managed by tapering slowly over an extended period rather than stopping abruptly.\n\nBenzos are not the devil as many portray them.But if mishandled, can indeed show you hell.\n\n\nAlso SSRIs aren't always perfect. They can have downsides, like side effects such as brain zaps, weight gain, and issues with blood pressure and sugar levels and much more. I personally had a very bad experience with an SSRI which even my doctor was unable to explain. \n\nRather than solely vilifying benzos, it's important to shed light on the adverse effects of SSRIs as well.",

It can be easy to feel a bit defense when someone is coming in hot. \n\n5) try to focus on some of the good things your job offers - hey, you don't have to take work home with you or come into a pile of work after a holiday! Your work is done as soon as the clock strikes 5.\n\n6) Find a mentor! Depending on your agency, maybe they have a mentor program or maybe there's a seasoned colleague that you feel comfortable going to for questions. Also, don't be afraid to ask for more training if you need it. I arranged to do additional call shadowing about 6 months into my role, as I felt I wasn't catching on as quickly as other newbies. I was able to listen into calls and also have someone come sit with me and listen to my calls/provide suggestions to improve. \n\n7)  know your limit. I wish I could say that everything got better and it became my dream job, but that wasn't the case for me. It was absolutely a great learning experience that taught me what kind of work I do not enjoy. I lasted 1.5 years but I knew within the first month that it wasn't for me. I became more and more stressed and simply couldn't cope anymore. Luckily, I had a great boss. I was honest with him that I had done all I could to make it work but it wasn't a fit for me. I asked if he could help me transition to another department and he did. I was much happier after moving to a new department. \n\nI hope it works out for you, but even if it doesn't, just know that it wasn't a waste. Every opportunity is 1 step closer to where you want to be. You'll learn about what you like in a job and what you don't.",

If we can't come to agreement, then we will suggest to the new employee that this may not the right place for them and find something that is a fit for them. We let them decide. Being a new employee gives you an opportunity to shine. They hired you for a reason. Good reasons. Among others they could have chosen, they chose you. If anything, they should be nervous about how you would feel about them and how they do things. Bring your best and show your best. Don't be anxious. So much to learn, yes.. but they picked you because you were the best candidate and here you are - show them what you can do!",

I work in the med field and as soon as I got comfortable and confident in the job I had started they moved me to a new position and the intense anxiety started up again.

Also the drink mix \"magnesium calm\", or even the gummies but the drink mix provably gives relief a lot faster. Either way I'm sorry this is happening and I empathize. It'll get less intense but I would say the anxiety won't get significantly better until you're comfortable there (at least in my case)\n\nMy anxiety was so bad the other week I made a mistake I was so anxious about making that could've ended pretty badly. It didn't, and I didn't grt yelled at or in trouble. It actually kind of helped because I had to face it. I certainly won't be making a mistake like that again but it was a lesson in how my anxiety makes everything much bigger than it needs to be.

I even work in a pro-mental health environment and that doesn't help internally. \n\nHowever, you can try to maybe approach it with medicine + therapy, and corrective thinking. \n\nFor example, one of my favorite hobbies is taking my jeep into the mountains on some really cool trails. Worst case scenario? Forest fire blazes through. However, I don't drive every trail panicking about a forest fire. Sure, if it happens, it would be scary but I would operate accordingly if it does occur. \n\nSame thing with your job.

Pushing yourself even if it makes u feel bad will ultimately help u. Just take small steps and don\u2019t beat yourself up if u have bad days, or need to call in every once in a while just to let your brain rest, it\u2019s totally okay to do that. not everyday is going to be your day.",

In an emergency (lvl 10, ready to call 911) a half 20 oz bottle of water plus a healthy scoop of that stuff is a GODSEND!!! Remind her that if she has surges of panic that it's normal to feel those waves and each one will get less severe. Hug her, rub her back gently. Don't curse at her, speak softly, avoid triggering words or topics (i.e. death, kill, murder, just dont use those words at all, lol).\n\nLet her know she has made it through worse and she will make it through this too. Remind her how long it's been since it's started and she's still going strong...and therefore, she will make it to the other side! As soon as she can tolerate it, find something funny or cute for her to watch (stand-up comedy, kittens snuggling, ASMR, etc.)\n\nThe gratitude for a warm caring heart during those moments has brought tears to my eyes and warmed my heart to my bf even when I've been extremely pissed at him. Even without the magnesium, your energy toward her makes such a huge impact. It sincerely feels like you're dying. There's little difference mentally speaking between believing you're dying and really dying. There's never certainty or confidence that you're going to be okay THIS time. Til you've felt it, you can't really know how terrifying it is! \n\nAlso, props to you for caring and trying to help :)",

I want someone to help me through breathing exercises and keep the unnecessary talk to a minimum as well as keep my dog away from me (because she wont stop whimpering and it drives me nuts). It can also be helpful if you take over the \"task\" she was doing; like if shes in the middle of dinner and has a PA, it might help for you monitor it all so she can focus on coming out of the attack. Get a plan with her, only she can tell you want she wants.",

Wipe down and clear off surfaces. Put away all the stuff that accumulates on tabletops and counters. Scrub toilets and clean bathtubs so she can have a relaxing bath.  And don't ask her what else you can do or where the cleaning stuff is-- just figure it out. If you can't find it, go buy it.  Likely this will help your marriage too, as women often feel completely overwhelmed with the housework and the mental load that goes with it.  Good luck to you and your wife.",

Listening to music, dancing, arts & crafts, playing with my plants. I have to tell myself that it is ok and these are the things that will help me. I think when anxiety is really bad, it perceives everything as a threat and doesn't understand stress from non-stress. \n\nThis may sound cheesy, but something I have found helpful is writing down when anxiety comes up during an activity that doesn't warrant it. I find it gets the loud part of my mind out when I write it out on paper. I write repeatedly things like, \"This activity actually calms me and brings me joy, I don't need you right now, anxiety.\" Write what feels right and makes sense to you. It's best to be genuine. I do this until I hear a different tone in my head, relaxed and rational. The physical symptoms don't go away immediately, but give it some time, and you should feel different. The most important part is not to give into the fear. Impossible, I know, lol. But just like you don't need the anxiety in that moment, you also can tell the fear to come at a more appropriate time. Pen and paper buddy. It has helped me so much. Even when you're like, \"I don't want to write it down,\" do it. Anxiety will snub all of your ideas that could help you. Do your best to shut it down and follow through with your move to break its cycle. \n\nIt is your mind, your body, and your nervous system. You are in control. \n\nI hope you're able to enjoy painting again soon!",

        "body": "I was diagnosed with GAD when I was 7. It has flared up throughout different stages of my life, often following change or trauma. I\u2019ve had a lot of both in the past few years, but have managed to keep pushing through my life. I feel like it\u2019s suddenly all coming to a head. \n\nRight now I am going through a really intense flare up that is becoming debilitating. My intense physical reactions to driving, flying, threats of illness, claustrophobia, etc are getting stronger and stronger. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m mentally \u201cafraid\u201d of these things. It\u2019s that when I am put in situations involving these things (which is almost every situation to be honest), I almost start choking. I feel nausea, I try to swallow, the air gets stuck, I choke, and then a shot of adrenaline gets poured into my system. This will repeat and go on for hours. It happens when I\u2019m traveling, at work, at social events, at dinners, at the gym, everywhere. By the end of a day, I am physically ill from all the stress and adrenaline that has been dumped into my body. Shivery, exhausted, stomach upset. It\u2019s getting so hard to carry on.\n\nI have a great partner and a great job, and lately I feel like I can\u2019t handle either. I found myself crying in the bathtub today just thinking about the upcoming month. This month, my work is asking me to travel and fly to present to and dine with important clients, multiple times. My partner wants to do so many normal things that normal partners do. Dates, movies, shows with his friends, a road trip to meet his dad, a road trip to meet my family. All of these things sound like elements of a happy and fun life. \n\nAnd yet\u2026all I want is to rest. All I want is no plans, all I want is a break. All of these events will require hours of me choking back nausea and pure fight or flight. I don\u2019t even know if my body can handle more of this. I am so burnt out, I am barely making it through life. I am starting to take the benzos prescribed to me purely for flying in small doses just to make it through these situations with my relationship and my job. I hate myself for this and know it isn\u2019t a sustainable long term solution, while also feeling the drug work less and less as drugs do. \n\nI just want to move to a house in the woods and be alone, where no one is asking anything of me. And yet I also know this drive for isolation isn\u2019t \u201cme\u201d, it\u2019s pure fear. If fear wasn\u2019t involved I would love my relationship and my job. I\u2019m just so tired.\n\nIf anyone read this rant, I appreciate you so much. \n\n",

I haven\u2019t felt genuine happiness in months and I truly don\u2019t know what makes me happy.

I have nightmares that I can\u2019t even explain and when I do dream, I have full control of them. They are always me on top of a hill alone, no noise no pain but when I interact with people they don\u2019t notice me.

I don\u2019t even want to wake up in the morning so the idea of work nowadays doesn\u2019t interest me. A lot of people tell me they have anxiety and it\u2019s normal but I struggle to believe them. \n\nI have no idea how my story ends and it\u2019s places like Reddit that weirdly keep me sane. Thousands of people like me. Do I need help or is this life with anxiety and this is it for me ?",

Everyday of my life is so miserable. Because of the crippling anxiety I don\u2019t have a girlfriend, damaged relationship with my family, and feeling so lonely. The biggest pain is loss of my voice due to social anxiety. If I can fix that, then I would be able to fix other aspects of my social anxiety."

What makes it better is that a lot of the times now I don't even need to take it, I just feel safe knowing I have the option to do so if I can't calm myself on my own, I hope that makes sense. Exposing yourself to social situations works for a lot of ppl but never did for me, it torments me and I'm incapable of being a human for weeks after, so I just accepted the fact that I'll always struggle, and I've also accepted the fact that I'll fail at times in life because of my anxiety. Missed appointments, exams, not doing something I was supposed to or told myself I'd do because of anxiety - accepting that sometimes I just can't was the best progress I've made so far with having social anxiety all my life, because in a way it comforts me too, I've realized life isn't over if I fail and so far I've always bounced back so it proved out to be true.

Also me becoming a supervisor and having to run the show on Sundays and having to be the boss and help my coworkers and having to stop conflicts when they happen also helped me... so I actually am still in the process of learning how to come out of my shell but I find myself smiling at people and greeting people and having more interaction with people on a daily basis now that I have that job..",

I had an upset stomach one night after they were asleep, and all I could think about was, \"What if I die tonight? What will my kids do in the morning? What if they find me dead? Do they know to call 911?\" It was an upset stomach, and again I KNEW I was more than likely totally fine, but \"WHAT IF?\" I only got 2 or 3 hours of sleep that night, and not because feeling sick, but because I couldn't turn my anxiety brain off.",

        "body": "I have a job interview tomorrow. I am 25f (almost 26) and have worked since I was 16 up until a year ago when I had a panic attack that literally changed my entire life. I can\u2019t even begin to explain how different I am mentally, socially\u2026 everything. Most days I honestly feel wish I wasn\u2019t alive. But that\u2019s not the point of this. My anxiety was so bad and my panic was so intense that I couldn\u2019t work. I just\u2026 couldn\u2019t. I slowly began working for friends and family, whether it be watching their kids or helping them clean or taking care of animals at a barn. While doing these things, I still had panic attacks but I knew I could go home and sleep or I knew that it wouldn\u2019t be long. But tomorrow, I have a job interview and I desperately need money so I desperately need the job. But I am completely and utterly terrified that if I get it, I will not be able to keep working due to my anxiety. \n\nIt\u2019s a sales job, as that\u2019s the only way I\u2019ll ever be able to make real money, and I\u2019m afraid I won\u2019t be able to hold it down because my brain fucking hates me. Everyone around me is so successful and I think not having money makes my anxiety worse because I am literally useless. I need a job. I want a job. But I\u2019m so terrified for the interview that I\u2019ve puked up everything I\u2019ve eaten today. \n\nI have no skills. I am not good at anything. The only thing I have going for me is that I\u2019m a little attractive and so everyone was pushing me to get a job in sales because they think that because I look good, people are going to buy from me and therefore I\u2019ll make a lot of money. I just need help. I don\u2019t know what to do. ",

I\u2019m about to return to work after 3 weeks off after experiencing severe panic attacks post Covid infection and am quite anxious but I think telling my employer fully what I am going through and what my needs are is going to help me keep my job.",

I smoked a little last week, I didn't have anxiety but it still didn't make me want to pick up the habit again. I feel so much more alive now",

It took about 2 weeks for the alcohol to \u201cleave my system,\u201d but since it has I no longer experience intense physical anxiety in the afternoons like I was before. For context I was averaging about ten drinks a week with plenty of sober nights in between, so it\u2019s not like I hadn\u2019t gone a day without drinking.\n\nIf you\u2019re sober-curious, I say go for it, it\u2019s worth it!! Maybe this is the sign you\u2019ve been waiting for.",

As someone who has been crippled with awful anxiety so much that I have been bed ridden for days and have no idea what I'm anxious about. It's not like your typical anxiety over finances or a job interview. It's a serious debilitating disorder that can cause the quality of ones life to be completely awful. Anxiety disorder isn't just about social anxiety and worrying, it's worry about really dumb stuff that doesn't matter, but you can't help but worry. And you're not realistic about the consequences, you immediately think of the worst possible scenario and consider it as the most likely thing to happen, even if the opposite is true. Because of that, it negatively affects your quality of life - it crushes your ambition, because you're too worried to take risks; it affects relationships because you're not secure enough and you end up with trust issues that cause problems.

                "body": "There are degrees of anxiety. Anxiety disorders can include specific phobias, including social anxiety disorder, to varying degrees of general anxiety disorder. For example, I have general anxiety disorder and can be prone to panic attacks; it used to be bad enough that I was bed-ridden a lot of the time, but now it's just bad enough to make life difficult and occasionally make me feel like I can't breathe. You're doing a lot of people with mental illness a disservice by gatekeeping their problems simply because your anxiety is more severe than theirs.\n\nI also don't think most people who self-diagnose with mental illness or neurodivergence are doing it as a \"flex.\" A lot of people feel like there's something wrong, but they don't know what. They find comfort in being able to put a name to what they feel. I do absolutely agree that some people are self-diagnosing inaccurately and there are absolutely people who don't understand what it means to have an anxiety disorder; but I don't think your overall assessment is fair.",

Everything I was anxious about had a reason. Fast forward a few months ago (September)  I was smoking w33d. (I have for the past 2 1/2 ish years) but I was just mentally in a bad place. Depression I assume. I ended up smoking so much to the point I couldn\u2019t feel that \u201chigh\u201d anymore. I ended up greening out and having the absolute worst panic attack of my life. I thought I was dying. Genuinely. It lasted a little over 2 hours. After that, everything went downhill. My quality of life went to complete shit. I\u2019d have an anxiety attack every single day. The only time I wasn\u2019t in a severe anxiety ridden, depersonalized state, was when I was asleep. Which I did a lot. All day everyday for 2 weeks I\u2019d sleep. I lost nearly 11 pounds in those 2 weeks. I\u2019ve been on Zoloft now since October. From 25mg, to 50, to now 75. And I am JUST starting to feel a big difference. When I say this was the absolute worst 5 months of my life I mean it. I had no will to do anything. I\u2019d tell myself everyday how I wished I never smoked so much. I wish I could just feel okay for just a moment. I had forgotten who I was and what I felt like before what had happened. I\u2019m doing a lot better now. Still not 100%. And still not even close. But I do not panic as much as I used to. I still Have depersonalization and derealization but I\u2019m taking it day by day. It\u2019s hard. Life can be hard. But anyone out there who has been in this, or a similar position. You are not crazy, you are safe. And you will be okay. Take each day as it comes. Breathe. Focus on the now. It will get better. It may take weeks, it may take months. Maybe even years. But one day you will wake up and realize you\u2019ve come a long way. I wish everyone the best \ud83d\udda4",

                "body": "I was diagnosed with GAD and social anxiety when I was in high school back in 2007. 100mg zoloft barely even touched upon the issues I had. \n\nI remember having lunch with my father in 2008 or 2009, him not knowing I was on a prescription or had any anxiety disorder, while he went off about how people shouldn't be prescribed medication for anxiety or depression as it just \"masks\" the problem.\n\nIt really affected me so negatively, knowing he felt that way. Then, in 2012, when he was diagnosed with bipolar 2 (with anxiety) and was being medicated, it felt like an even larger slap in the face. I've come to the realization that he just didn't understand how bad anxiety could be.\n\nI feel like more often than not, the younger generations do tend to have anxiety disorders due to what they have lived through so far with all of the world conflicts and the pandemic. But they are more willing to speak about them and ask for help. When people are actively talking about anxiety disorders, it allows others to recognize it in themselves and seek help if they need to.\n\nI'm against them thinking it's \"cool\" or a \"flex\" to have anxiety or to sort of make a mockery of it, but anxiety does come in all shapes and forms. You don't honestly know what is actually going on in someone else's brain or how it fully affects them.\n\nShould point out, there are actually people that know the difference between being anxious and being nervous.",

                "body": "It's not something that is easy for people to grasp, as it affects everyone a little differently. I'm the opposite; had \"tough love\" parents growing up, was terrified of being thought of as weak or \"crazy\", and muddled through life until in my late 20s I had to acknowledge that something was up. Some of the things that helped me realize were: a) My boyfriend  (now husband's) face when I would tell him all the things I was thinking about, b) watching and reading things made by anxious people and seeing the breakneak pace of the characters' thoughts and how they matched mine, and c) getting real tired of crying and hyperventilating, the crippling fear of failure, clenching my jaw and hurting my teeth, having stomach aches all the time, and all that other fun shit.\n\nBecause of this, I'm hesitant to tell someone that they don't have anxiety because I felt like I hadn't \"earned it\" or had the right to ask for meds to improve my quality of life. I've just now started going to therapy and tried Buspirone (which didn't help) and now Citalopram, in my 30s. Maybe it'll help and I'll regret not doing it sooner. \n\nI know it sucks when you are going through, frankly, horrific stuff and it feels like people make light of it, or want attention, or act like it's not a big deal. I get it. But they never will unless they experience it too, which I wouldn't wish on anyone.",

I think I picked up something and I put it in the plastic folder of that timeslot's file. I think. I can't remember.\ncolleague, couple hours later: <shows picture of file> oh this file? Don't have\u00a0\nMe: I can't remember specifically but I'll check when I'm in!\n\n\nMe, on the side, to friends (text): OMG DO THEY THINK I TOOK IT WTF WHY DO THEY SAY SMARTWATCH LIKE R THEY SUSPECTING MY INTEGRITY\n\n\nfriend1: er no you know kids they lose everything zzz\nfriend2: uh if it was me I honestly think \"blue Apple smartwatch\" is an identifying indicator, nothing more or less than that!\n\n\nMe, trying to explain this entire sitch to my psychologist at my following appt after the incident: /FLAILS. Am I even normal lol how can this be normal?!?!\nMy psychologist: well no I do think that your anxiety/reaction is abit more intense/severe than the average person ...!\n\n\n(help)\n\n\nThis smartwatch incident was some weeks ago. Right now I'm simultaneously freaking out about (1) last minute relief teaching coverage (2) a schedule that is prefaced by \"subject to changes\" which in reality looks like \"we can call you at last minute notice whenever we wish so even if you don't originally have to be in office that day you're never entirely free\" (3) curriculum creation timelines (4) most crucially, the fact that the work has to be damn up to scratch. I'm NOT being perfectionist on this, but speaking from experience - tbh I'm on the homestretch of what has been a 3ish almost 4month curriculum material revamp/creation thing, and spotted a few of my own mistakes.\n\n\nI mean like okay, I'm not perfect BUT HOW DID IT GO TO PRINT and HOW DID NO ONE ELSE TEACHING THE SAME LEVEL DISCOVER THE MISTAKE and ohmygoodness if the parents complain it will be MY FAULT and I'm such a stupid dumb worker (source: teaching diploma and 5 yrs of teaching experience)\n\n\nYup. I'm just dumb, I guess. Also, Asian society parents suck. Teaching sucks. Every success belongs to\u00a0 the kid and every fault is the teacher's and in a cheapskate Asian SME no one bothers to proofcheck and if its wrong its MY fault.\n\n\nThis is not like job interview anxiety and its exhausting asf.\n\n\nThanks for coming to my ted talk.",

                "body": "There's certainly different levels to it OP. I am diagnosed with GAD. And as an autistic person anxiety probably affects me in different ways than it affects allistic people.\n\nI feel constantly on edge being out in public, with a knot in my stomach, and I need to stim in most social situations as a coping mechanism. I get panic attacks occasionally but not as frequently as some. I have nights where my head feels like it's spinning because I am overthinking something so obsessively and I become literally unable to focus on anything fun because I am so worked up over a certain thing. When I have to do interviews or give presentations, my voice gets stuttery, my throat gets dry and my body starts shaking and tingling (I get adrenaline). Anxiety also often affects my sexual performance, which creates this horrid feedback loop of feeling like I'm disappointing my partner (a lot of my anxiety is tied to women and the way I have been treated in past relationships sadly). I go non-verbal in large groups, especially if I feel like people aren't interested in me or aren't noticing me or simply if there's just too many people and too much noise. I worry about social interactions enough that I'm wary of people, find it difficult to make friends and almost always assume that people don't like me and that they're right to feel that way. I fear being trapped in crowded spaces due to experiences of working in London and get panicky when I have to stand in the middle of a train carriage with people blocking exits on both sides. If I am feeling particularly anxious I can't go to sleep on time. I also have recurring thoughts that my life isn't going anywhere and that Im never going to live a normal life and achieve the things that other people have achieved (having a family and a successful career for example). I am doing a PhD to try and overcome this but some days I find it hard to get out of bed because I don't feel like I'm good enough at what I do.\n\nThe thing is, if I don't go out in public I don't feel so bad. If I don't try and put myself around people, I become safe and in a bubble where I feel ok. So as long as I keep to myself and stay indoors I don't feel so bad about social stuff (I do still have a persistent worry about my PhD and my life performance though).\n\nSo when the DSM-5 and ICD-11 say it happens \"most days\" I think context is really important here. Because anxiety does also cause you to retreat in a safe space and start avoiding the causes of it, and if you do that you create this false feeling of safeness where you think you aren't feeling anxious. But what's actually happening is you're not conditioning yourself to the things that make you anxious and this means when you do expose yourself again your ability to cope actually suffers by your avoidance. And obviously your life is affected if you cannot go outside, so you are still feeling anxious subconsciously.\n\nI don't think I'm as anxious as you OP by what you describe but I definitely have some really bad days with it, a lot of kinda sucky days with it, some meh days and some ok days. I wouldn't say everyone with a GAD diagnosis experiences it to the extremes you do, and I would also say there's people who experience it to a pathological extent where they pose a serious risk to their or someone else's health and need to be put under watch - so much worse than you. Different levels of it.\n\nI would be careful not to tell people that everyone has to experience anxiety the way you do to have GAD based on what I've said above. It is better to show people what the diagnostic criteria are.\n\nThe DSM-5 and ICD-11 criteria are here for anyone interested:\nhttps://cks.nice.org.uk/topics/generalized-anxiety-disorder/diagnosis/diagnosis/",

                "body": "My main gripe was just how stress and feeling anxious was so normalized growing up. I'm from China, and feeling stressed when they had a leaderboard for your exam scores for everyone to see was normal, and was good for you since it would push you to do better next time.\n\nThis kept going all the way through senior high school - everyone around me was stressed and \"depressed\" and it was just something that came with studying. But no one ever taught us HOW to cope with it, just that everyone goes through it.\n\nAs for my parents? Mental health was (and still is, to an extent) stigmatized here. It was considered over-reacting, or that the person simply just needs to go outside and socialize more to \"fix\" it. I adopted the same mindset and just kept going. Things like meditation, mindfulness or ways to release stress were not treated seriously, such as \"who has time for that?!\" etc. \n\nFast forward final year I was so burnt out and physically unwell from my anxiety that I completely stopped attending my finals. It made it even worse for obvious reasons, but it was a welcome change because it made me realize that what I was personally going through wasn't something I should just deal with, like being stressed for a quiz or something. It pushed me to get help, get medication and allowed me to head into uni with a more educated headspace on my disorder, and ultimately changing my lifestyle for the better.\n\nIt sucks seeing people romanticise mental disorders like depression or anxiety, because they really aren't fun. People think it's all mental when in reality it alters the way your body behaves radically, and actively inhibits doing certain things that someone without an anxiety disorder would just do without a second thought.\n\nMy anxiety manifests itself HEAVY into my stomach. I would wake up nauseous, heaving out nothing but air and sometimes stomach acid, have no appetite and end up with extreme stomach cramps. Anxiety is definitely a BIG umbrella term as well, so makes it harder for the average person to really comprehend how bad it can get.\n\nThankfully though, one of the benefits of the internet is that everyone has access to information, it's just a matter of being willing to go out of your way to do so. I don't really see people flexing that they have an anxiety disorder though, maybe just self-diagnosing their anxiety as GAD etc, which can be harmful if inaccurate. \n\nAs long as we keep sharing our stories, hopefully people learn to get help early in any shape or form unlike me who just kept ignoring it haha. Having anxiety disorder wasn't even in my HEAD until I got properly diagnosed.",

I was talking about something right now. I forgot. I forgot I told you this thing, I will say it again with the same exact words\" etc.). I do have to make a clarification on one of your points though: social anxiety can and is definitely as debilitating as generalized anxiety disorder. It is not cutesy shyness or fidgeting. It caused me to develop agoraphobia, and decreased my quality of life so much that I barely have any contact with people anymore because of it and need help for most basic social tasks like doing phone calls or going to appointments because otherwise I will risk a panic attack. No anxiety disorder is light or cute, nor shouldn't it be underestimated. There is a difference between being shy or introvert and having clinical social anxiety, in the same way in which there's a difference between being someone who worries a lot and having generalized anxiety. I understand the frustration but there is no need to throw people with a different aspect of a disorder under the bus to make a point.\n\n(Sorry if I come across a bit ticked off, I have GAD, panic disorder, and social anxiety, and I spent decades with people undermining two out of the three or not taking me seriously, which allowed them to run rabid in my brain and grow bigger until they became nigh unmanageable, so I am a bit sensitive about the topic)",

I actually find coffee/black tea very calming. If I am feeling a bit stressed or anxious a cup will help me relax and slow down. I can drink coffee all day and night and still fall asleep. \n\nEven on bupropion, which some people find makes drinking coffee an unpleasant experience, I notice no increased anxiety, heart rate, etc from coffee. Coffee also has some health benefits so unless I experience negative effects I will keep on doing what I am doing. \n\nObviously if someone has negative reactions to it then it should be discontinued. I have a relative who is very caffeine sensitive - gets both an increase in physical effects like rapid heart rate and anxiety - and can\u2019t touch it at all. My husband, who does not have an anxiety disorder, can\u2019t drink it past 10:00am as he won\u2019t be able to sleep 12 hours later.",

I think I\u2019ve fallen back into DPDR as well as I\u2019ve experienced it before after a panic attack after smoking weed and I feel disconnected and out of it, not like myself etc. It doesn\u2019t feel as intense as before but coupled with my health anxiety and the existential thoughts it sucks\n\nI started taking Zoloft a few days ago and my brain is convincing itself that it\u2019s the Zoloft that caused it, even before I started it again my brain was like what if it somehow causes DPDR again, and it looks like I convinced my brain cause I\u2019m getting symptoms of DPDR and it somehow caused permanent damage\neven though Zoloft is what helped me get out of it before ( I took it to help when I had the panic attack from weed ) \n\nIt feels like my brain unlocked these new thoughts and now I can\u2019t get rid of the information like I\u2019ve convinced myself of these thoughts even though I know it\u2019s not real, but I guess that\u2019s what OCD/anxiety does to you. I feel like life doesn\u2019t even matter anymore since you could just reincarnate or something and it\u2019s just a loop and just other thoughts like that.\n\nI don\u2019t wanna go crazy and I\u2019ve looked around the sub and I see other people deal with it but I just hope someone can share some insight or their own stories.",

My lymph nodes in my neck and armpits felt painful. They are not swollen though. I had shoulder pain and collarbone pain. I was feeling pretty tired and\nrun down. I was also getting chills. About 5 days after, had a fever. This only lasted like an hour or 2 and then felt cold. The next day I woke up fine ish. I did feel a little cold still and then feverish later but not like the first day. That night I had a bit of a sore throat and then I woke up with a sore throat the next morning. This went away and my throat felt fine. I still have a weird feeling in my neck and armpits and the upper shoulder/collar bone pain. I've never felt this way. Usually when I'm sick, I just feel bad for one day and then get better from there. The thing is I haven't felt really bad because most of these symptoms come and go. Honestly I'm so scared because I looked up HIV symptoms and some of them match the ones I have. Is it possible to get HIV this way?",

        "body": "So I have had a couple panic attacks in my life but few and far between. I had one on Saturday and what's different about this one is that it seemed to come out of nowhere, with no trigger. The only thing I can think of was possibly too much caffeine in my system...I drink one or two cups a day but this day I had 2 cups closer together and maybe didn't eat enough food. But it was like I was fine, sitting on the couch watching TV with my kids, and the next thing I knew I started getting the physical sensations of anxiety, and noticing the sensations brought on more anxiety until it became a full blown panic attack. And it lasted several hours, coming in waves (what I now know is called a rolling panic attack). It was really scary and awful in the moment, and since it happened, my brain cannot stop thinking about it constantly. I feel like I haven't able to fully return to a state of normal in the last 2 days, and this of course is giving me even more anxiety now.\n\n I feel like it's especially worse at night when I try to sleep, I ruminate about everything and worry that I'm losing my mind and going crazy (my brother has schizophrenia and is heavily medicated, so mental illness runs in my family). I have been fine for the most part but definitely noticed increasing anxiety in the last couple years overall , and higher sensitivity to caffeine. I just want to stop thinking about anxiety and my brain and physical sensations... I'm very worried I'll induce another panic attack by constantly thinking about it. I feel like I'm being tortured in a way. \n\nIt's like this panic attack made me realize just how fragile the human mind is, and now I'm hyper focused on that and hyper vigilant, like my brain is constantly on high alert, trying to detect any signs of stress and analyze if it's a threat or not. I feel like my brain is broken. I just want to be able to relax and sleep. I've been up for hours unable to sleep because every time I try to sleep my mind races with all sorts of thoughts related to anxiety and panic attacks.\n\n I am already in the process of cutting coffee out for good because I never want to feel the way I felt again, and I know coffee can make anxiety worse. And I have been trying breathing exercises as well to calm my body but I don't feel like it's working enough. \nAnyone else feel this way and have any advice? I'm not really into taking medications if I can avoid it, I prefer taking natural things. ",

        "body": "Hi,\n\nI'm a college freshman in my second semester. I'm studying engineering, and I basically failed my first semester (1.94 GPA) and got put on academic probation. I was a 3.9 GPA student in highschool, and that first semester experience left me in fear and anxiety. I had very difficult professors my first semester, and he \\[the prof\\] made me feel worthless. I go to a school with a competitive academic enviornment, and i don't feel like i belong. i started getting anxiety attacks often because i feel like im gonna fail again. I'm putting in a lot of studying this time, but i'm discouraged because I don't do well on every quiz/test, though my grades are definitely better overall this time around.\n\nAdditioanlly, my grandfather passed away two days ago, and the semester is getting very roguh workload. i don't handle deaths well, so i haven't even talked to my dad about it... I need some advice on what i should do... i'm very anxiety stricken. I have two midterms this week, and i was studying but i feel like i can't do it anymore. also, i notice and my fiends tell me that i self deprecate myself constantly around them. it's a bad habit and im trying to stop, i don't want to be a failure but i am after that first semester. bouncing back is easier said than done at my college.\n\n, i don't know i need to call my dad i just need advice on what to do please.

Set a path and schedule for yourself for school that will benefit you mentally and in class.\n\nI\u2019m in school too, i know how overwhelming this shit gets, especially when your a student who really cares about how you perform academically. I was in the same spot last year acidemically, I was a freshman who was great in HS but college hit me in the face. That summer i just talked with my family and really opened up about my anxiety and how much i hated it there, and I ended switching majors and going to a better school.\n\nI\u2019m not telling u to switch majors or schools, but i\u2019m letting you know it\u2019s important to use the other people in your life to help you make decisions. You\u2019re a stressed out college freshman who is struggling, you can\u2019t do everything on your own. Talk to your academic advisors, your family, and even friends who have the same workload as you. They\u2019ll understand and give their perspective if they\u2019re real ones in your life.\n\nI will say though, if you don\u2019t feel like you belong just don\u2019t be scared to just LOOK at other options. You don\u2019t have to set anything in stone, but just know that theres so many options academically. \n\nI\u2019m sorry for your loss, definitely talk to your dad \ud83d\ude4f",

                "body": "OMG the moment Ive been waiting for. \n\nNegative thought spirals are more than just \"the world is doomed\" its also these 'rehearsal arguments' that you have either with someone you know personally or some content you consumed. I spent the better part of a year in counseling because too much of this flipped my mental health. I worked at Walmart during covid and I had a horrendous boss; blatant favoritism was his favorite game, he was two-faced, a liar, a cheater, a no good dirty rotten scoundrel, awful human being who didnt know how to care about anyone else but himself. I spent so much time in my head having these 'rehearsal argument', if anything went wrong I was rehearsing what I was going to say, multiple versions of each argument, I wanted to have the perfect come backs, the perfect reasonings, etc. I wanted to win any argument against him and make him look like a fool. It took on physical manifestations, I would shake, lose my appetite, my periods were off, my bowel movements were weird, etc; it was an awful thing I did to myself. I did go to counseling, for multiple reasons, and she helped me stop it for awhile but I definitely realized that they only want to get it to stop was to leave, so I quit. I didnt leave the job, I left a terrible manager. \n\nHow did I do it? My counselor thought me how to stop a negative thought spiral. Our conversations were more extensive than what im going to say here but this is the real take away. Also, I should tell you that I still have NTS, I still read things on here and scream in my head like \"oh NTA, I would have slapped MIL in so hard or saying something so terrible!!! OH!\" But that learning this prevents me from going over the edge anymore and getting back to those deep and dark places. But also, I have an over active imagination, some people call it Maladaptive dreaming, so im ALWAYS talking to myself, even as I type this. \n\nSo ive posted this before, but I know it helps for me and other have commented back that they would give it a try, I havent heard updates. This is something I picked up in counseling and I truly rely on this.  \nNegative thought spirals: You have to stop yourself from spiraling down into negative thoughts. This takes a lot of practice but its SO worth trying. Ill tell you what I do and you find something that works for you. I have a very vivid imagination, JSYK. The first step is recognizing that the negative thought spiral is happening and that you want it to stop. So then I start to change my thought process from what it is to the following: I pretend that Im in a room watching these negative thoughts on a projector. I pick up the remote, pause the projection, turn off the image, remove the cd from the player, put it back in its case, then I take down and put the projector away. In detail, Ill imagine looking for the velcro strap that hold the extension cord together, Ill fiddle with the bag as the lid keeps folding closed, I dismantle the stand, then I look for my keys and get into the closet where the equipment is stored and Ill start putting things away. I then get out a ladder and take down the projector screen that is attached to the wall. When I say \"in detail\" I mean it. I spend probably 20ish minutes in this thought process because its neutral. It is not a negative thought nor a positive one. Once Im down with this, I then leave the room and go to my happy place. It does help that this is a literal moment in my life from almost 3 summers ago when I would set up and take down this very set up for a bunch of grade school kids during a summer program thing. So its almost a vivid memory but one that I can call upon at any given moment. Super helpful!  \nThis works because you get so focused on \"completing\" this imaginary task that you forget about NTS, and then suddenly your mind is much clearer and you are much calmer so that you can redirect into your happy place. The neutral thought could be just sitting and crocheting, cleaning the dishes, petting your dog, maybe even mowing the lawn, an imaginary task you can get lost in that will not evoke negative or positive thoughts. So you should pick a neutral thought that you can imagine clearly. And then if you dont want to go to a happy place or are struggling to get there you could pick up a task that you have to be focused on that directs your imagination, like reading a book or watching something youve never seen before, like maybe youtube or a podcast. If you actually want to absorb the content you have to stop with your own thoughts and focus on those being provided by the creator.\n\nstopping NTS takes so much practice and work, its hard, its really hard to get yourself to stop, especially if the person that triggers the NTS the most is someone you cant get away from. But if its causing you anxiety, you have to find away or its only going to get worse. If you want more info or have follow up questions, im happy to chat.",

I hate when mentally healthy people give you trash responses like \"just don't think about it\" or \"just be happy\"... It's like they are a part of this autopilot world that is completely tuned out from pain and suffering. I know polarizing myself from others is going to make me continue to be unhappy, it's just hard to be friends with these people. Basically, if you think of your depression and anxiety as your leg... it's like you are not allowed to show them your leg... your leg is too complex for them to understand. Bad analogy, but it feels like that integral to me. \n\nI didn't know that this can manifest into physical symptoms, there are people who I resent and the internal anger is getting pretty out of control, and now I want to talk about it with my therapist (we can never get to all the things... there's so many things... but this can be a high priority item, we've been talking about rumination, so it works). What you are describing sounds like meditation, but forcing yourself to think of one thing instead of nothing. Does it take a long time to start working? I feel like it's very hard to tell my brain what to do. I appreciate you defining neutral thoughts. You are making me consider what I previously thought was impossible."

        "body": "20F. I have never been this anxious or hypochondriac in my life. I have always feared developing serious or major conditions, random body pains has always made me think of the worse case scenario, but my parkinson\u2019s anxiety has totally ruined me. \n\nI dropped out of school and skipped one semester of college because my anxiety thinks I\u2019d no longer be able to walk in a few months, that I might not be able to live and go back to my normal life and self anymore. I no longer look forward another day because I\u2019m afraid tomorrow might be the day I\u2019d develop more symptoms of Parkinson\u2019s. I always feel guilty of enjoying something or being happy because I feel like the worse might come next. I always get anxious to lie down on bed or sit because resting makes me feel all the bad things. Whenever I look at my family, I feel guilty because I fear I might cause them a lot of troubles in the days to come. \n\nEverything started when I caught a viral infection last January. I started having internal tremors occuring at rest in one limb (and googling led me to Parkinson\u2019s). I\u2019ve also started experiencing twitching all over my body since then. I\u2019ve been to several neurologists, they all just said it might be something less serious, as Parkinson\u2019s is an old man disease. But reading stories of other people, I learnt that a lot of them developed Parkinson\u2019s at a young age and neurologists didn\u2019t think they had Parkinson\u2019s at first because they\u2019re \u201ctoo young\u201d for an old man\u2019s disease. I\u2019ve heard the same thing from several doctors, but I couldn\u2019t find peace in it, because what if I\u2019m one of the unlucky people who would develop a neurodegenerative disease at 19? What if my symptoms are being overlooked because I\u2019m young? What if I\u2019d end up being like those people who heard the same thing, but ended up having it? \n\nI no longer feel alive anymore. Ever since I started experiencing it, I feel like my life has already stopped and I\u2019m just here, but no longer existing. I can\u2019t stand the thought of maybe I have it because I\u2019m just 20, my life has just started, how would I reach my dreams and goals? How would I live my life to the fullest? If I have it?\n\nI hope I could enjoy life again rather than living just to fear what\u2019s next.",

I got blood work done on Thursday and i should get the results tomorrow, but waiting is scary too of course. \n\n\nCurrently it's the liver stuff and my brain trying to convince me I have cancer because my anxiety makes my abdomen have wandering aches+ I bit somewhere in my mouth or something and I have 2 tiny ulcers. \n\n\nHow can i deal with this? It's so distressing because I know the thought processes are illogical but even knowing that doesn't help ke overcome the fear. It's like I'm in the passenger seat and my anxiety is in the drivers seat. The anxiety gives me random aches and makes me gassy, too, so it always makes me doubt. I'm 97% certain its the anxiety making me feel those things because I don't feel it when I'm not focused on it.",

        "body": "Hi there. 26 y/o M who had his first panic attack in January of this year (2024). Since then I\u2019ve been having them almost daily. Today while washing dishes, I felt like something bad was going to happen and I started to feel like I was going to have a hard time concentrating/focusing on things, racing thoughts of \u201c am I going crazy? Am I about to lose my mind?\u201d Honestly scared shitless. Can\u2019t tell If I was having a panic attack and or if I\u2019m starting to experience depersonalization/derealization or something. I hope not. I\u2019m currently not on any medication but scheduled to see a therapist/counselor for psychotherapy treatment and medicine therapy if needed. I\u2019m doing a little better now. Just scary because usually when I have panic attacks I can feel when they\u2019re about start and I can usually just let it pass. But this one felt very different and made me freak out because it made me feel like I was about to lose my mind or something. If this sounds like panic attack at a different degree than what I\u2019m used to then let me know. If anyone here has experienced this as well, please let me know what was your experience and how you coped with it. Thank you. Right now, I\u2019m just playing games to hopefully distract me from slipping into those thoughts. It was just random. Maybe I do need to take meds or something.",

I have a high resting heart rate, I get nervous sweats, and I am fidgety and shaky. I've been like this for as long as I can remember, and as a result I feel that my health is not what it could be. \n\nWhat I struggle with in particular is the super intense physical symptoms that come when something anxiety provoking happens (i.e. I see someone I haven't seen in a long time, or meeting someone off of a dating app). My heart begins to beat so incredibly fast and loud that I can hear it in my head, I break out into a sweat all over, I feel light headed, I shake intensely, full on fight or flight mode even though I know I am not in danger. I know it is normal to feel some level of physical anxiety in a variety of situations, but this is so intense and dysfunctional. I hate it. I want to be able to hold myself in these situations, even though they don't happen often. \n\nDoes anyone have advice? Coping mechanisms? Ways to prevent it from happening? Would I benefit from an anxiolytic that is taken as needed, like hydroxyzine? ",

        "timestamp": "2024-03-04 00:27:34",
        "body": "Hi, I get panic sweats in so many situations, but for the purpose of this post I\u2019m focusing on the panic sweats that hinder my punctuality and wellbeing. FIRST must clarify that I do NOT have agoraphobia. I love going out and in fact I need to get out at least once a day. Whether it\u2019s errands or whatnot. I\u2019m very social, but my anxiety makes my body go into panic mode even if I\u2019m enjoying a convo. \n\nI\u2019ve always had a habit growing up of being late- Not bc I don\u2019t care, but because of time blindness aaaaand\u2026 SWEATING. The sweating has only increased since I gained weight when I developed hypothyroidism about 8 years ago. I\u2019m Female mid 20s.\n\nThe sweat usually starts once I feel that I am running late, and in turn makes me even later. I try my best to go slow and steady, get up extra early and prepare the night before, so that I can have a smooth get ready and leave on time. Those rare times are the best. However, I could be 99% ready to leave but suddenly I can\u2019t find my glasses, I forgot to take the trash out with me, I have to take my roommates dog out, I don\u2019t like the top that I chose and have to try new options last minute, etc. suddenly the sweat kicks in and it kicks in fast. Before I know it my scalp is soaking wet so my head is itchy and my hairdo is messed up, my makeup gets blotchy, and I can\u2019t get dressed bc I\u2019m too soaked in sweat. This in turn means I have to lay down and deep breathe for at least 10 minutes to regulate my body temp before I can go back to getting dressed, fix my hair a bit and leave the house. \n\nI have an analogy for how it feels. It is like I am trying to ride my bike down a nice path but it gets stuck in thick mud. I have to trudge through this mud to get back to the smooth & fast path. The \u201cmud\u201d are all the little things I can see in my way to leaving- grabbing something from the fridge, throwing together an iced coffee, putting my shoes on, and then ofc the unexpected or not planned things like stated above. I see all these things as an obstacle slowing me down which makes the panic worse which makes the sweat worse which makes me need to slow down which makes me late. This has ruined college classes, jobs, parties, errands, doing things with other people, outside events, etc. \n\nAs stated way above, I get panic sweats in many other situations as well like talking to store employees or other casual conversation with strangers or whatever. I\u2019m not shy by any means, but my body absolutely writhes sometimes. Another example is going to a mall vs a strip mall. Strip malls are easy- walk from car to store and back to care. But outdoor or indoor malls give me that \u201cmud\u201d feeling. I always panic sweat at malls and big stores because I feel like I have to trudge through all the people and long distance of other stores to get where I need to be. \n\nI know I am out of shape but this sweating is NOT related to that (at least not directly- the sweat starts while I\u2019m literally sitting or barely moving). And OF COURSE, once my Xanax has kicked in and I was able to sit silently for about 30 minutes, not only does my body cool down, but sometimes I\u2019m FREEZING. Absolutely one of the worst panic symptoms I have. Can ANYONE relate to this kind of nervous sweat that impacts your life?",

I personally felt nothing, and my doctor switched me to Buspirone (started at 15 mg, now 45). I personally get a bit of brain fog for about 30 mins approx 30 mins after taking a dose. I also lose a majority of my food impulse control during this period. Outside of this though it has done wonders for my anxiety.

For about 5 years I have been suffering from depression, apathy and very strong anxiety (especially social anxiety), about a two years ago, I was able to leave my fucking family, living in which was a real hell and asked for help in a big city. psychologists and psychiatrists worked with me at the crisis center, I was prescribed first one antidepressant, then another antidepressant and a neuroleptic, now I'm on another drug, in general, I've been on pills for almost a year. it seems that depressive states have become easier and panic attacks have become less frequent, but anxiety has not gone away. I've never been self-contained or a strong introvert, but now I can't even go to the MG store for cigarettes. because of this, I have huge problems finding a job and communicating with people, especially interviews and other stuff where they ask me about something and stare into my soul, as if I've done something terrible and I'm making excuses and not trying not to starve to death. I ran away from the last interview, I have another one in three hours. what should I do? I mean with social anxiety and all that. It's just that no pills take it off even by half. how do I work and communicate with people? I apologize for my English and for pouring out all my problems here, thank you",

You are strong and capable of overcoming this.\nIt's okay to not have everything figured out right now. Focus on taking small, manageable steps towards feeling better, and celebrate your progress along the way. At home, if you're feeling empty, try doing something you love, like drawing, reading a book, or watching your favorite movie. It's okay to feel sad sometimes, but doing things you enjoy can help fill up your heart.\nRemember, healing takes time, it's okay to ask for help when you need it and  Surround yourself with understanding and compassionate individuals who can provide you with the encouragement you need.",

It seems like if you have been diagnosed with depression that maybe you have already opened up to your primary care doctor and they havent done anything. If you haven\u2019t, make sure to let them know. It\u2019s very hard when you are a teenager and can\u2019t do anything about treating your mental health. If you can\u2019t see a psychiatrist or psychologist, it is difficult to make progress is getting treated. What I did was I did well in school and then went to a college out of state. For a fresh start and because you can get mental health treatment at your college. And my college actually took mental illness very seriously, because it is so common. Once you turn 18 you can get treatment no matter what your parents say.  And if you go to a clinic through your school you may not have to worry about copays or insurance issues. For now, I would recommend getting a book written by a psychologist on anxiety for people with anxiety. And a journal that is meant to help with anxiety. Finding the right treatment for mental illness can take awhile, so be kind to yourself and find ways to relax. If you are having a panic attack, you can do something to kind of shock yourself out of it, like putting your face in ice water for 30 seconds, eating a warhead, doing intense exercise, and then when you feel calmed down you can distract yourself with something to keep the anxiety away for a bit. Also, I would recommend texting a mental health crisis line if needed. When you have panic attacks, if you can text a crisis number it can really help with feeling understood. And they may be able to provide some resources. Mental health crisis lines are not just for when you want to d*e. A panic attack is a mental health crisis so you don\u2019t have to feel like it\u2019s not bad enough to talk to the crisis line people.",

Surprisingly, my very conservative & old psychiatrist signed off on me getting a card after I have an honest conversation with him.\n\nBest of luck to you. I\u2019m 30M btw",

        "body": "&#x200B;\n\n1. I was very anxious to tell my parents I was gay, I was sat there for over an hour building up the courage and when I told them you can hear in my voice how anxious I was and the anxiety eased. \n2. Assessment period at university made me very anxious and down worrying about what grades I would get. I would be sat that looking up different careers because I was certain I was gonna fail and the course I was doing was too hard, and when I went to bed I would thinking about the situation. \n3. New years eve for some reason will get me anxious and then when its time to count down and bring in the New year, the anxiety will intensify and then ease after. \n4. In January I had sex and although It was safe sex and a condom was worn, after I felt a little warm and got anxious cause I though I contracted HIV and then I started googling the symptoms and when I would expect the symptoms to show or other STIs. \n5. I was worried about my finances and thought I was gonna go bankrupt because I weren't gonna get my student finance, so I had to check my student finance account to see if I was due a payment and cause it weren't working, I then checked my bank old statements and tried to calculate if I was due some. I am due some so the anxiety eased. \n6. I drove down this road which had a speed camera sign and I couldn't remember if I had accidently gone over the little a bit, and so I came home checked google maps to see if there was cameras, and then looked on the police website and see if it was listed there and couldn't see so I had to drive down the road again to check and there weren't which eased my anxiety. \n7. I accidentally hit a bin when I was driving and although I knew it was a bin, that made me anxious that maybe it was a car and not a bin. I was a bit anxious after that and I wanted to go and check. \n8. If I have any medical or dentist appointments then that gives me anxiety and it can just be a check up or if I'm going for a blood test and after the anxiety will ease. \n9. its now assessment period at university which means I am again getting anxious and this week it has been bad, and I couldn't eat and barely sleep    \n\nThen there's just little things that get me anxious that pass quickly, say if I lost my student ID card and I can't find it then that will get me anxious.

I studied abroad for three months in greece and then suffered my first panic attack there. I came home thinking I'd be okay but I got worse with medication. I'm planning on getting off because I felt better without it than I do on it as I didn't have it abroad yet stayed for 70 more days. I did research and everything I was excited to come home and pitch it all...then my world fell apart.\n\nthe reason I said the title is because i dropped out of in person classes and am practically cowardice when I once was a go getter. I feel like a failure and I'm no longer the person I was. I work with doordash but the thought of having inperson things terrifies me. It's only been three months of this and I know it will get better, I'm trying my best but in my own head it feels like it's not enough as I once was so so good. Im afraid of failing and being stuck this way forever. Everyone knows me as the person I was, I wanna be that person again. I feel like I'm doing badly even though I've never felt like this before and I know I deserve a rest.\n\nSigh I just any advice, encouragement or anything would be good. Im struggling as I don't have anyone to tell me I'm doing this right or even doing a good job I guess. I just started therapy and accepted I am mentally struggling after 10 years of suffering. I'm just trying day by day.\n\nThanks for reading!!\n\n",

        "body": "Watch those tiny little fleeting destructive thoughts that you let go unchallenged. No matter what you feel physically or emotionally or the thoughts that pop in your mind,  ultimately you decide what you actually believe day in and day out. That\u2019s more important than anything you think, feel, or believe at any given moment. Don\u2019t fall in that trap of acting like your mind is out of your control alien to you because \u201cIT\u201d is  causing your symptoms without your consent. That\u2019s just you feeding it some more. We get discouraged and think we haven\u2019t succeeded in convincing ourselves that there is no danger because we nonetheless got symptoms. Thats just an old recording that\u2019s roaming around in the back of your subconscious, your dream mind, your habit mind. That\u2019s to be expected. Even if you are nervous or scared when it happens, don\u2019t be when it\u2019s not happening. Eventually that more positive GENERAL belief system will creep into the moments when you are having symptoms and soften them. By this I don\u2019t mean frantically watching those thoughts trying to snuff them out wanting the symptoms to go away.  Let them come and go and just calmly refute them as inaccurate. Don\u2019t go back and forth about this. Trying to figure this out is not helpful. Make up your mind and stick to your guns. You are not in any danger assuming you have been checked out and this is so. Most of these thougts are not so much thoughts as they are just you focusing on your body. There should be no struggle in this. Don\u2019t run away trying to force yourself. Sometimes even focussing on your symptoms and doing the opposite helps if you are in a place where you can relax. Usually the key is to do nothing. To decide this isn\u2019t a problem. If you find yourself struggling unable to stop focusing on your symptoms, that\u2019s fine, let it drift away on its own. This doesn\u2019t need your attention. That\u2019s what we get stuck on. This feeling we have to do something. That there is something to solve. That just keeps you worried. Once it\u2019s over, dust yourself off and go on with your day and quickly decide without much thought that you are getting better at this. Hey, I had this since 1986 until 2000 and to much lesser extent til 2013. I\u2019m still here at 67. If all you have is cardiophobia, you are safe. ",

I had to put the chair down and try to breathe normal (I\u2019m not sure if my breath has been odd anytime a panic attack comes on either.) I recovered within five minutes or so. Okay, cool.

But\u2026\n\nSecond time was the worse; I had helped my mothers boyfriend lift something extremely heavy, and I for whatever reason decided to try to push my limits right there and immediately right after finally putting it where it needed to be, my heart started beating crazy, my ears started to ring super loud, my vision started to dim, and I could barely hear myself speak. I ended up laying on the floor but wasn\u2019t recovering and had a huge panic attack while I was unable to really do much.\n\nLong story, short, I went to the hospital, got checked out, they said it was vasovagal syncope. Nothing wrong with my heart, nothing crazy with my blood work, nothing but the fact I had lifted something super heavy. Makes sense. Okay, I guess but now the anxiety is ramped up this time.\n\nEvery day since then, is nothing but filled with the fear of fainting, always feeling dizzy, always tired, always feeling odd. It doesn\u2019t stop. Every thing I do, I\u2019m afraid to faint. I\u2019m afraid to go out because what if I was to faint in that said store. What if I faint and nobody is there to help me? What if I faint in the bathtub full of water and drown? What if\u2026?\n\nNow about 2 days ago, I had a really rough panic attack, and I\u2019m talking really BAD. I began to disassociate hard, become confused, scared of everything, I didn\u2019t wanna stay still or didn\u2019t know what to do, so I called 911. While I sat in the ambulance they were talking to me and I let them know that I think I\u2019m going to faint. I felt extremely dizzy, my body went numb, my heart was beating out of my chest, everything felt fuzzy but I was still present to talk. But oh god, I felt fucking terrible. I kinda became accepting of if I had fainted, whatever, but it\u2019s the fact that that\u2019s even a thing that is bothering me. I DONT wanna faint because of anxiety.\n\nAnd once again, literally yesterday, while I\u2019m sitting at home playing video games I randomly start seeing stars; for no reason in particular, my vision just starts going haywire because why not so I decided to lay down on the floor for maybe a minute or so just because I think I\u2019m going to faint AGAIN. What the fuck??\n\nMy point is, they say anxiety or panic attacks don\u2019t cause you to faint, and if you do it\u2019s a very rare case and most likely it\u2019s because you\u2019re hyperventilating, (which might be my case, I don\u2019t know.) but almost every day I feel like that. Hell, I even see posts of people saying their anxiety causes them to faint so how am I supposed to function normally when I sometimes, if not, ALWAYS feel faint from the slightest bit of anxiety?\n\nI wanna be strong, I wanna be able to do things. I wanna face my anxiety head on, but if it causes me to faint, how am I exactly supposed to face that head on? Granted I haven\u2019t fainted fully from it just yet; but being on the brink of it, almost every time, is a rough experience. I don\u2019t know if panic attacks can be so bad that they can literally make you feel you\u2019re going to faint and die; I know they\u2019re the worse thing ever but like this? This is TOO much. I just don\u2019t know what to do. It\u2019s almost debilating.",

No pain, discomfort, runny nose or congestion at all, no pain bending over or blowing my nose, no sore throat, no fever, no lethargy, nothing. Nothing at all except that morning snot plus I sneeze twice a day. I don't even blow out or cough up ANY yellow the rest of the day. Even if I sneeze and I have to blow my nose cause of it, it is always crystal clear and thin mucus.\n\n Two months ago I was much more symptomatic for a cold for a few days (congestion, body aches, nasty mucus and phlegm) and then ALL my symptoms went away except for that morning stuff every once in a while. I went to the doctor a few weeks ago and he looked at me for 2 seconds, looked in my ear and basically said \"here's some antibiotics but its probably gonna do more harm than good since you don't have any symptoms of a sinus infection at all, just a little yellow snot when you wake up\"\n\nI've read that yellow snot ALWAYS means sinus infection...because it gets its color from an immune system response to a pathogen. I haven't taken the antibiotics yet, but I'm wondering if I should. My BF thinks I'm overanalyzing. For example, this morning he was like \"you're overthinking it, I mean look at mine\" and then he disgustingly showed me his nasal mucus and it was the same yellow color as mine. I was like \"that's disgusting, but thanks for trying to reassure me it's normal for you too..?\"\n\nI am very very cautious about just taking antibiotics when I don't actually need them, cause it does do more harm than good.\n\nIf you were me, would you take them? Or should I really not phase myself over it given the complete lack of almost all symptoms of a sinus infection???\n\nThanks.",

        "body": "hi everyone, i hope this post is allowed here. im not one for asking advice about my life but i dont really have anywhere else to share. i just want some opinions on this.  \n\n\n**a little backstory:** so i went to the doctor recently, as i was struggling a lot. i had numbness in my arm, really bad chest pain, etc. i just wanted reassurance that it wasnt something wrong with my heart since it lasted about 5 days.  \n\n\nthe doctor was great and diagnosed me with GAD, and i felt secure with that, since i have been dealing with symptoms like this for about 2-3 years now in certain situations. they also prescribed me a medicine (hydroxyzine) which im only meant to take short term.  \n\n\n**the main problem:** arose when i asked my dad to get it for me from the pharmacy, and he asked what its for. i said \"to help with anxiety\" since i had briefly looked it up beforehand. he said a lot more, but to cut it short, he was against it.\n\n  \nHe said that the doctor might not even be sure its anxiety, and since im \"healthy, have good parents, and a good life\" there's really nothing to worry about. he then asked me what im worried about, and i didnt really know how to answer. it's not something that's easy to answer you know? especially when every little thing makes you stressed out.  \n\n\nanyway, he also proceeded to use my grandpa as an example; apparently he was prescribed medicine for a mental health condition and his condition became worse, so he refused to take the medicine and got better. i really dont think that's what made him better, but does that relate to my problem? not necessarily. yet he says it'll happen to me too.  \n\n\nthe final part was he said that \"the pharmaceutical industry is there purely to make profit, everyone around has some sort of medicine and its not the way life should be lived\". my stance on this was : we have doctors for a reason. i dont think they're prescribing these things to make money.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhe said he's dealt with pain, anxiety etc. himself and he's fine. he said everyone feels anxious about things and its normal, i should play sports and go on walks and have fun and not take life so seriously. How can i not take it seriously? i feel stressed out even when im watching a movie.  \n\n\nso im sorry this was long, im just really feeling hopeless. I thought i had finally found a solution even if it was a temporary one, but it got shut down so fast.\n\nLegally i am an adult now (18), and i could still take the medicine if i want, but after all the stuff he put in my head, its hard to want to do anything anymore. i'm even starting to question everything and it just sucks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TLDR**: my dad isn't taking my diagnosis seriously. he thinks anxiety is 'in my head', and that my prescribed meds will make my condition worse so i shouldn't take them, as i have nothing in life to worry about, so i should just calm down and be happy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny advice is appreciated.  \n\n\n  \n",

Anxiety is at root about control, and yoir dad sounds like he is threatened by you accepting help from your doctor. He thinks you should control everything yourself, suggesting that's how he lives. But that's not as healthy or satisfying as he might think. \n\nI don't know how you explain to him, but you might get more freedom of action around him if you demonstrate some things he relates to control. Study, lift weights, do chores etc. \n\nNo offence taken if you feel it's not the way to go. You are on the ground and know better than us. But give it some thought.",

Not to say he's always wrong, but your dad's not always gonna now whats best for you and I also think a lot of parents want to see their kids as \"perfect\" in their minds and knowing they're taking medication may affect that perception they have cause they view it as some sort of crutch. It's possible you'll grow out the anxiety without ever needing meds like he said but if you're struggling right now, which it seems you are, you should at least give them a try. Your dad is right to some extent that you will still have to overcome the anxiety yourself, cause there is no magical drug that will cure all your anxiety, but meds help with that process. The only concern I have though is the specific medication your doctor prescribed, most people with anxiety take SSRI's, I don't have any experience with hydroxyzine so my previous comment may not be relevent to you.  Also ask yourself this, if a doctor prescribes you antibiotics cause you have a tissue eating infection, will you not take them solely cause some pharmacutical company will make a profit off them?",

It helps to calm you down. I have GAD also and it has helped me through some hard times. Your father is a little too old fashioned and he\u2019s not looking at this from the perspective of someone with GAD. Sometimes medication is the only option and sometimes it saves lives. Take your meds and see if they help. If they don\u2019t help or you have some bad side effects then stop taking them. It\u2019s as easy as that. Whatever you decide to do, I hope you start feeling better.",

May be your dad's anxiety was not as seriously you are experiencing now and he might have had more tools like social setting, and less expectations in life at that time to deal with this. He is correct in saying that everybody goes through it. He is also correct that pharma industry stands to make bucks but it is pushing the frotier of modern medicine. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think the sweet spot is, you need to take his advice seriously about not relying on medicine and going out for activities, sun, people etc.. But if you feel as if you absolutely cannot take it, then may be take it for short time. But be aware that the longer you take it for, the more you ll be dependent on it and the more chances of it increasing your anxiety on withdrawal. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou need growth in your life.

My heart was racing so much I was convinced I was going to have a heart attack. For months after this I had panic attacks every day which lasted hours on end where all I could think about was how I was gonna die. \n\nFast forward a few months and my mind changing which body part to stress about a few times, I still have some issues. No issues arise during the day, only at night time as soon as I try hit the hay and go to sleep. I switch into manual breathing mode where I have to think about breathing if I want to breathe and it means when I try sleep, I suddenly wake up flustered and in panic mode. I\u2019ve tried to many things to get around this , but nothing is working . I don\u2019t know if anybody has any advice or if anyone has been in a similar situation, but I\u2019d love help to get out of the situation. ",

(She had an undiagnosed heart condition that ran in her family). Ever since then I have been obsessed with my heart and have experienced heart palpitations almost daily.\nI\u2019ve gone into the doctor on multiple occasions. Multiple ER visits. A Echocardiogram, a 72 hour holter monitor, many EKG tests. All normal. Showing less than 1% pvcs. And a cardiologist telling me it\u2019s normal. Blood test. All normal. \nYet I feel like I have them constantly. \nI\u2019m currently in the process of changing medications which has also been extremely rough. \nNothing seems to work the way fluoxetine used to. \nI feel so alone. \nI\u2019m constantly obsessing over my palpitations convinced there is something is wrong. \nI want out of this vicious cycle. I want to live my life. \nI feel like I\u2019ve because so used to focusing in my body that I notice the palpitations even when I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m thinking about them. \nIt\u2019s exhausting. \nSorry for the rant I just need support and know I\u2019m not alone. \n\nAlso currently in therapy and DBT group. \nJust ready to feel normal.

This doesn\u2019t always help, because an anxious brain can still argue that \u201cwell, I might be that rare case\u201d, and that\u2019s true. \n\nHealth anxiety is tricky because health issues and disease are a very real part of being human. Your brain is searching for a 0% chance that you don\u2019t have cancer/deathly disease but I\u2019m sorry you will never get there. There will never not be a chance of you having and or getting something. Which is why health anxiety feels so debilitating. \nPersonally, I control the things I can when it comes to my health and I\u2019m aware of the statistics around the bigger cancer types; symptoms, age of onset, etc. I also get my yearly check ups and promise myself after a clean bill of health that I\u2019m done with worrying \u2026.till next year lmao \ud83e\udd23 \n\nBest of luck, you\u2019re not alone",

        "body": "I've always had anxiety but I never had a panic attack until about 4 months ago. Now I have one almost every day or even multiple a day. It's turned me into a hypochondriac as well as I'm scared that every little pain is a heart attack. I'm almost always shaking. I'm shaking right now and I'm not sure what the cause is so I immediately start thinking it's a heart attack, especially as I feel pain/tingling in my arms and neck. Every time I've had pain it's never been a heart attack, but these pains are new so they scare me. \n\nI've been prescribed hydroxyzine 25 mg as needed by my therapist and it worked great for the first week or two but now and then it seems my anxiety is just too strong for it. I took it this morning and again 6 hours apart as it says to do, but I'm shaking so much and I'm fearful of a heart attack. \n\nI thought I was making progress with the hydroxyzine and I felt back to normal when I first started taking it, but now I feel defeated and unable to make progress. I'm only 20 years old and I'm terrified of being like this for however much longer. It's hard for me to find something that actually helps me calm down and helps with managing my anxiety at all. \n\nI believe the reason I am so anxious these past few days is because I planned on going back to my college apartment to finish out the semester in person. I switched all of my classes online so I could be home while my anxiety was so bad, but I think the thought of going back there and living alone where I could have a heart attack and no one would know is causing my anxiety to spike again. \n\nAlso, I'm scared of taking the hydroxyzine because I read that it could cause Qt prolongation and I'm just scared of anything having to do with the heart. I am a healthy 20 year old woman that exercises (a bit less now because I am so anxious and exercise makes me more anxious bc my high heart rate scares me) so I know it's unlikely anything will happen to me, but those thoughts get in my head and I can't stop ruminating on them. \n\nDoes anyone know anything that may help me? I'm so tired of being like this. I want to live my life but everything feels so impossible right now. Will it hurt me if I take another hydroxyzine now so I can calm down or should I wait another 6 hours? My prescription says to take 1-2 as needed, but that's terrifying to me and I just need some sense talked into me I think. \n\nI'm going to get my blood work done tomorrow and I think that should put me at ease with my heart issues? I was also in the hospital about a month ago because my panic attacks were so bad and I didn't sleep for a day and couldn't stop them. That's when I was prescribed the hydroxyzine. They took an EKG and everything on me and there was nothing wrong with my heart, so how likely would it be that something is wrong with it now? Probably unlikely, but that doesn't stop my body from panicking. \n\nAnway, if anyone has any advice or anyhting, please help me. I am so desperate to be normal again. I already have a stressful life and this is making it unbearable. I don't feel like myself or even human anymore.",

        "body": "I would like to start by stating that I am not someone specialized in psycotherapy or psychiatry, but I am someone who has suffered from more than 11 years from an anxiety disorder (ocd). I migrated from my home country to Berlin around a year ago and faced the worst state of my mental health and despite looking for help here, I could not find it and I supose that there are other people in the same situation.\n\nI am writing in the hopes of reaching out to everyone going through anxiety or any anxiety disorder. Coming to Berlin with more than 10 years of anxiety/panic atttacks and a lot of obsessive thoughts without being proper addressed and without any support made me really understand that something had to be done and that something should come from me. During this year, I discovered two books that are changing my life and I would really love to share them with all of you. The first and most important book is called \"At last a life\" by Paul David. This book shares the author\u2019s journey to overcoming anxiety through acceptance and understanding, rather than resistance. The book emphasizes that anxiety is fueled by a cycle of fear and misunderstanding, suggesting that facing anxiety without fear is key to breaking this cycle. \n\nThe second book is \"How to Stubbornly Refuse to Make Yourself Miserable about Anything--yes, Anything!\" by Albert Ellis. Albert Ellis\u2019s book promotes emotional self-regulation using Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT), arguing that our beliefs about events, not the events themselves, cause distress. By challenging irrational beliefs and adopting rational ones. This book emphases the importance of refusing to let external circumstances control one\u2019s emotional state.\n\nFrom reading the books and from my own journey, I would really like to emphasize that there is no instant cure, no linear improvement but a journey with a lot of ups and downs and that only you can help yourself. Personally, I wished somebody gave me these books 11 years ago and I wish from the bottom of my heart that these books can help some of you to start the journey of recovery. \n\nWish you all the best!",

I had just gotten a promotion at work I went on a long vacation that I really enjoyed. I was having a lot of fun dating a lot of different people and then towards the end of 2022 I went through a sudden break up, that kind of took me crashing down. Throughout the spring of 2023 I was very stressed which started to manifest in health anxiety. In May 2023 I was dating someone I was really unsure about and in September that person I got in a big fight and my heart rate continued to stay in the high 60s as the average.\n\nThat person and I broke up in January and my anxiety has been at all time high. I just went back on SSRI\u2019s for the first time in years. \n\nLooking back at this heart rate data, I wonder if it\u2019s a reflection of my anxiety. I\u2019m gonna talk to my doctor and my therapist about this just to find out if it really could explain why I\u2019ve been feeling so incredibly on edge and anxious and why lots of symptoms that I haven\u2019t been feeling in a long time have returned.\n\nIf you have a smart watch, it might be worth checking your heart rate data and comparing it to times when you felt good and times when you felt anxious and see what the data says. I\u2019d be curious to hear what the results are.",

I got so anxious that I went to the hospital to be checked and they found nothing out of the ordinary with a check up. I am going to see my primary soon to ask what is wrong but I wonder if this is anxiety induced. I\u2019ll have a random hot flash when I overthink think about it. I\u2019m just confused I don\u2019t think it\u2019s life threatening but it\u2019s scary to deal with. My arm went numb for a few hours Monday night last week but after was fine. But last night I felt my arm go cold and dull again, and this morning my arm was throbbing for a moment. Any advice please!",

Happens to me also. \n\nTry doing some stretches or relax your muscles however you usually do, and see if that helps. Do you usually sit for long periods of time at work? If so, try integrating some walking or stretching when you can, or just focus on moving your arm around to get blood going. \n\nThe main thing though, is addressing what is causing your anxiety in the first place. Are you diagnosed with anxiety in any way? Is there a lot of stress going on?",

I\u2019m at a point where aside from basic necessities, I have no desire to leave the house or be around other people. I don\u2019t like the sounds of public spaces, and whether I\u2019m interacting with them or not, being around more than two or three people I don\u2019t know makes my skin crawl\u2026 I can\u2019t think of any other way to describe how I feel. My mom said that\u2019s really offensive and makes me sound like a sociopath. I don\u2019t go around volunteering this, but she asked how it went and I told her. When I said I\u2019d prefer to only go out for necessities, and nothing else, she said my life would be pretty lonely. I\u2019ve accepted that, and told her I thought that was a given.

        "timestamp": "2024-03-03 15:11:26",
        "body": "Well, I'm over 30, and I can say I grew up as a typical everyday kid in the countryside, with a family that loved me a lot (those who are no longer here) and loves me a lot (those who are still alive).\n\nI live comfortably as I have an income, but nothing extraordinary. I'm looking for a job for two reasons:\n\n1) To have something to do.\n\n2) To have a higher income and live more comfortably.\n\nYes, I have a lot of free time, which unfortunately I don't enjoy at all. It might sound like a first-world problem, but... I SUFFER.\n\nWhatever I try to do (reading, music, movies, games), rarely brings me joy. Most of the time, when I try to do something entertaining, I get nervous, and annoying thoughts like \"why am I not having a good time? Why am I still restless? Should I do something else? Maybe I could enjoy my time better?\"\n\nSo, I've been living like this for the last 5-6 years (except for some occasional jobs I did). At this point, I would like to mention that I also had a long-term relationship with a very good and beautiful girl whom I decided to break up with just because... I got bored.\n\nMany would like to be in my position, but I just messed everything up (I don't regret it) because I just got bored.\n\nSo, am I alone? I suffer. I was in a relationship, still not having a good time. The worst part is that as time passes, I get anxious/worried more easily because I'm not 20 or 25, and I know I'm aging. This has triggered my misery even more because I know people around me are aging, losing, building their lives (family, etc.), and this takes away the pleasure from enjoying my hobbies.\n\nMy mind constantly thinks, \"Oh, I see an interesting (MAYBE) movie. Should I do something else? Should I read a book, become more educated, maybe open new doors and experience new things?\"\n\nI read a book: I'm bored. Okay, I learn new things. And? Why should I care?\n\nThese are my personal issues. There are also others related to society and our existence. I think about how much misery there is in the world and how suddenly life can be destroyed. This probably makes it difficult for me to relax and enjoy because I fear some disappointment.\n\nAnother part of my concern is about death. I grew up as a typical Christian (not extreme). Rarely went to church, and fasting was limited. I know that terrible crimes were committed because of Christianity, but... I had hope that in the end, something good awaits me (if I go to heaven).\n\nI have lost my faith because I simply know that people can easily be misled or tell lies, etc. There are so many theories, myths, stories, religions, ideas where people believe they have the truth and the right. So, with this logic, why should I believe in Christianity?\n\nSo, not knowing what exists after death worries me. I have read very little about the simulation theory. I'm afraid that after death, there is simply hell for everyone, regardless of whether you were good or bad.\n\nMany find pleasure in getting married and starting a family. Others strive and aim for it. Well, even that seems stressful to me. Just the thought that I have to be careful and raise a child/children gives me anxiety, and it feels like a burden.\n\nSo, in a nutshell, I'm over 30. I'm anxious because time is passing, and I'm aging. I fear starting a family, struggle to enjoy hobbies, and have existential concerns about what exists after death. These are my thoughts. Many times, sadness, anxiety, and boredom are so intense that I fear. I think I'll go crazy. I reach a point where I curse. I just curse (without wanting to) to release something. Besides being anxious and sad, I'm angry at how unfair life is.",

        "timestamp": "2024-03-03 21:01:45",
        "body": "First time poster here. I\u2019m a 24M currently in college and in a part time position with a company I\u2019ve been with for coming up on 8 years now. Over the last several months, almost a year, I\u2019ve been struggling to choose which path I want to take to begin my life as an \u201cadult man\u201d. The issue is I\u2019m not motivated or even passionate about the current major I\u2019m following right now, education, and that\u2019s causing me to hit a pot hole in my life path. I\u2019ve never been really great at school, but at work I really thrive on getting tasks done and being the guy to go to when something needs to be done. Since I\u2019ve been with the company for so long, going into a full time position wouldn\u2019t be out of the question but that would mean I\u2019d need to severely cut down course loads or even quit school altogether to focus on work.\n\nI have a strong support system of family and friends and have had discussions with everyone. Some say I should stick to taking my classes and using my degree as a crutch, while some say the degree isn\u2019t necessary if I make strides to be in a management position I\u2019d be making more money anyway in that career. I understand both sides of the argument, which is why I struggle so bad with sitting on the fence.\n\nUltimately, I side with the camp of going full time and putting school on hold. I feel like putting my all into the work that I\u2019m used to for almost 8 years would be a better use of my time than chipping away at a degree that may or may not help me down the road. The company I work for isn\u2019t going anywhere so there\u2019s always room to grow, but I feel like putting all my eggs in that basket would be a better long term commitment than getting a degree for something I\u2019m not passionate about. \n\nThis issue has unfortunately come with its fair share of anxiety and depression on my end. Because I feel like I\u2019m letting everyone down and making the incorrect decisions, I can\u2019t enjoy my hobbies anymore (video games, watching shows, hanging with friends) because I\u2019m always comparing myself to others. Why should I be able to sit here and participate in leisure activities, when I could be doing something more? Obviously transferring into full time can\u2019t happen over night, so I don\u2019t have much else to do except lay the foundation and work hard to achieve the goal in the end. \n\nAll in all, I\u2019m just frustrated with myself. I feel like no matter what path I choose, I\u2019ll make my parents disappointed or I\u2019ll make myself miserable. I know I\u2019m not old, by any stretch, but this mark in my life is a big one and I just wanted to throw my words into the ether to see what anyone has to say or get any advice to help with my anxiety and depression so I can enjoy life a little bit more.

I always check my phone to see if I have done anything and seemed to be okay until I saw my Teams app for work open in my apps. Pure panic comes over to me see why this is opened. I couldn\u2019t see anything to worry about, I messaged the guy on teams being apologetic for rushing and coming across rude/ doubt he even cared but just the fear had set in and it\u2019s work people. He read it and didn\u2019t reply.

It landed me in the ER. My BP was 184/134. What made me go into a panic attack was the feeling I was going to pass out in the employee\u2019s bathroom.  I made it back to my desk but it freaked me out and I started to feel like I wasn\u2019t even there. It scared the shit out of me.  It was hard to collect my thoughts and say what I felt when I spoke to EMS.  Prior to the panic attack, I had major tension in my shoulders and neck.  I wonder if this contributed to my almost passing out feeling.\n\nEver since then, I feel so out of touch with life.  I\u2019ll go do things but I bring all my things with me (inhaler, pulsox monitor, my panic meds even though I haven\u2019t used them in forever) because I\u2019m nervous it will happen again.

        "body": "Hello all,\n\nI have been on Lexapro for almost 20 years. The first 15 or so was only 5mg as I was sort of scared to be on medication. It had a noticeable but not huge effect on my anxiety. A few years back was struggling big time so I bumped up to 10mg. Again, it has a noticeable effect but certainly was not a cure all.\n\nI've tried to reduce my dosage a few times in the past and that has always ended poorly. I've also tried to switch to a few other SSRIs and that ended poorly as well.\n\nAbout 4 months ago, I had a series of stressful events that ramped my anxiety up heavily. Those stressful events have been dealt with but I've still been extremely anxious for 2 months after those events have ended and I'm not getting pretty bad depression (not usually a problem for me). I've been trying to deal with this as best I can with therapy, meditation, relaxation, etc but it has not helped. \n\nPart of me wants to increase my dosage to 15mg to see if that would help. The other part of me is terrified because 1) I know trying to get off this medication is almost not an option for me 2) Other SSRIs dont help and 3) It'll likely be ineffective at some point in the future and I'll be back in this situation with little room to go up further.\n\nI'm wondering if anyone else has had this situation and how they've handled it?",

Is it just a very long panic attack hangover? Am I too early to be thinking that the only solution is medication and therapy? (I have already started therapy)\n\nThanks for all your help.",

In my opinion it\u2019s normal to have some panic attack \u201changover\u201d but if you want to be sure that it was just that and not an underlying condition that is slowly arising I would suggest you get an appointment with a psychiatrist. They\u2019re trained to not judge and help you at the best of their ability; so on\u2019t be scared, get comfortable and tell them everything, just be honest, the more they know the more they can understand and therefore help. They will help you understand if it was just a big scare (so an appointment, max 2, will be enough) or if there is something underneath that is better to investigate (and in that case you can start a therapy) before it gets out of control! Best of luck!",

Because It's not like something triggered me into getting anxious and doing it, it feels like a constant urge. I try my best not to do it but as soon as I get distracted I catch myself doing it, and it's starting to cause irreversible damage. I won't be mentioning all the things I do to myself because I find it unnecessary and I don't want to trigger anyone, but it does get very compulsive sometimes, so I'm not really sure if it's my anxiety or OCD. I know it's not self harm because I do not do it on purpose, atleast not with the intention of hurting myself.  \n\n\nI just wanted to find out what it's called so I could find better ways to approach it, but whenever I try searching about it online the only results I get are hotlines. So i'm wondering if anyone knows what this could be related to? or just a medical term that I could search about, it would help a lot.",

        "body": "TW:  Surgery and urinary urgency discussion.\n\nEvening everyone,\n\nSo, I have a personal nightmare situation coming up in a little over a week.  I have my second of two eye surgeries scheduled.  I do suffer from frequent urinary urges on a semi-regular basis, but usually they hit more with anxiety/stressful situations.  At worst, I can pee a full bladder, and then 30 mins later, be peeing what feels like a pretty full bladder again.  I've never had an accident, but I've been close a few times.\n\nKnowing this can happen, for my first surgery (I'm under conscious sedation,) I got some incontinence pants for the occasion.  I didn't drink much, but still peed before going down for surgery, and was feeling confident about being prepared.  Unfortunately, about an hour or so into the surgery, I felt the familiar urge to pee.  The worst bit?  I COULDN'T actually pee.  Even knowing I had my safety knickers on, and technically it would be fine to pee, my body just wouldn't let me go.  I was in SO much pain for the rest of the surgery, and it being a delicate procedure, it's not like I could ask for a bathroom break!\n\nSo... ironically, I'm far more stressed and anxious about going down for surgery number two... not because they will be cutting into my eyeball, but because I really, REALLY don't want to experience that level of stress and pain again from needing to go NOW but not physically being able to.\n\nI tried the deep breathing at the time, tried relaxing my pelvis... I tried everything I could think of, but not a damned trickle, or reduction in the pressure pain/contractions/urge.\n\nI don't even know if there's anything more I can do to prevent it.  I was pretty calm on Surgery 1, simply because I felt really prepared.  Surgery 2, I now know that despite my preparations, I still ended up with such a horrible experience.  I was genuinely terrified my bladder would just straight up rupture.  The irony of course being that now I will be going down far more anxious, because of Surgery 1, that it may all become a self fulfilling prophecy.\n\nKnocking me properly out isn't an option unfortunately either - they need me awake and responsive as possible.  If it makes any difference to know, I was on propofol during the surgery.\n\nAny advice, greatly appreciated. Thank you!",

        "body": "I had a 'set back' in November where pins and needles in my hands (probably from not breathing enough, being a bit chilly and low on water that day) started off a whole panic thing and ruined a concert I was playing in (for me at least - I had to leave the room because my hands were wrong, I was sweating, and feeling a bit dizzy/nauseous). I didn't feel anxious or stressed until after I started with the 'physical' symptoms.\n\nThings have been better since but it happened today in a rehearsal for a different ensemble. I didn't leave the room (except during the break) but had the pins and needles and sweatiness for about an hour, trying to play through it and not hyper-focus on it and make it worse. But that was really difficult and I think the thing that might have got me out of it was having a little tuning problem with my instrument that I then had to focus on fixing and/or the fact that I said out loud that I might need to take a break.\n\nGenerally my anxiety levels are way better than a few years ago (I never seriously thought I'd even be able to go to an orchestra/rehearsal on a regular basis and \"get through it\", never went to lectures at uni, etc) but it seems to rear its head in new and ugly ways, with now new physical symptoms that seem to appear and then cause the anxiety (rather than anxiety first and then symptoms) - perhaps it's always been that way and I have more insight now, I'm not sure.\n\nMy questions: \n\nHow do you deal with symptoms \"in situ\" (and not leave what you're doing)?\n\nAm I just missing that there is some stress/anxiety that I'm ignoring until it's too late?",

        "body": "Hey there,\n\nI guess I just want to share my story somehow at this point. Sorry for the longer text but you will need some information to understand my situation. \n\nI\u2019ve been raised by a mother with lots of fears and caution, also had two experiences in my childhood where I was in fear of losing my life and/or my family. So I\u2019m somewhat prone to experiencing anxiety. \nIn 2013 I had a period where I would get some panic attacks and I would really expect to die at this point in time, even got taken to the ER once and checked out for all sorts of stuff. After some therapy sessions I was eventually able to cope with it mostly. \nHowever, sometimes I would still have episodes of kind of a \u201cflutter\u201d in my chest. Always blamed that on the anxiety too. \n\nFast forward 6 years and I\u2019m getting the 2nd shot of the BioNTech mRNA vaccine. Two weeks after, I start having this flutter in my chest again, but it doesn\u2019t go away. Chest and back pain starts, difficult to breathe. I call the ambulance and they also call an emergency doctor out to my home. Once she\u2019s there I pass out and she has to defibrillate me on the spot and administer CPR. Turns out I had a predisposition for atrial flutter and a mild case of myocarditis due to the vaccine. Both together quite dangerous though. \nSpent 9 days in the hospital, multiple heart catheter exams. 3 months later the myocarditis has healed and I have again a heart catheter to \u201cfix\u201d the atrial flutter. Has been gone ever since and I\u2019m really happy about that. \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffb\n\nI\u2019m a better person today. I exercise regularly and have fun doing that (indoor climbing). I eat healthy, have an ideal weight and I am in the physical shape of my lifetime. I got my priorities in life straight, due to the things I\u2019ve learned after being reanimated. Crossed some experiences off my personal bucket list. Got a great family, a great job with very good pay and good colleagues. I have friends that support me.\n\nThe last 9 months have been intense emotionally. My father has severe dementia and now has to live in a caretaking facility. My brother and I organized all of that. My mother still subconsciously refuses to accept the state of decline and keeps talking as if things would get better. \nParents in law both have cancer in terminal stage, only a matter of time. Mother in law even head a brain metastasis removed recently. I took care of all medical and administrative things with them, was very engaged and supportive, always calling and visiting, nearly daily. \n\nNow to my anxiety: two weeks ago I had a bit of dizziness. Suddenly I\u2019m in fear of my life, expecting to die right there on the spot. Since then, things started to develop again. Sometimes the feeling of light dizziness but no vertigo, more like feeling unreal in the moment. Some pressure in my head, different spots, changes sometimes. I was convinced that I now have a brain tumor or MS or Parkinson or whatever. Something really dangerous. \n\nI don\u2019t have any of that when I sleep, watch TV or exercise. I go indoor climbing, when I\u2019m on the wall I don\u2019t feel anything, I\u2019m in good shape and as capable as always. \n\nWent to see my doctor and he is very supportive of the situation and encouraging me to start a therapy for my PTSD. I have an appointment to start it in 2 days. \n\nThere are ups and downs during a day. Sometimes I feel like I\u2019m terminally sick, then some minutes or hours later I recognize that the symptoms are gone. Then they come back and I\u2019m in fear again. \n\nAnxiety is a b*tch. \n\nAny comments, question or experiences are welcome. Appreciate you all reading this far. \n",

Right now I take it just before bed and I didn't realize that Buspar can cause sleep issues. I'm hoping that's the cause and not something else",

        "body": "(I go quite in detail and better safe than sorry, so NSFW tag)\n\nI have been dealing with anxiety for a long time and during one of my counselling sessions a year ago, I reached a conclusion that anxiety is overthinking to a unhealthy level.\n\nIt made sense back then, I plan back up plans for everything I did in life like back up conversation topics when talking to someone.\n\nSo my solution of turning off my brain was to live in the present. Whenever I start thinking of the past or the future, trying to infer from what has happened and thinking of what is going to happen, I tell myself to stfu and it worked. I was at a time in my life where I  was finding difficulty getting out of bed too, so it was perfect for me, I was able to be happier.\n\nBut after a year, I started having problems with focus and memory, I was straight up forgetting where my phone was, whether I talked to someone about a topic and more. Eventually it started affecting school work, I was forgetful and careless in many things I did.\n\nI wanted to \"turn on\" my brain again so I could maybe get smarter or something, but again I am struggling to get out of bed again despite my \"solution\" of turning off my brain, I'm in a constant state of mental confusion and I even developed a stutter.\n\nBefore my anxiety got so bad, I was in public speaking, top of my class and just happy with life in general. Now I'm underperforming, unable to speak properly and miserable. It's depressing knowing I'm a shell of my former self.\n\nI'm even going into mandatory military service soon, the military is no place for confusion, fuck ups or forgetfulness. A stutter would definitely get me bullied by the seniority in there.\n\nI don't really know what is the point of this post except for maybe meeting someone else who tried the turning off their brain trick. Or maybe someone who experienced something similar who can help me out here :)",

Wellbutrin isn't a first-line (or whatever it's called) treatment for anxiety, and I suffer from panic attacks, which based on some research I'm doing could be made worse with Wellbutrin (at least at first).

Trust me, you\u2019d know for sure if you were having a stroke. \n\nIf you still are anxious about it, consider getting checked more (blood tests etc.) so you have more of a mental back up that everything\u2019s alright. \nMeantime talk to a psychiatrist or psychologist/psychotherapist. I know these things might be expensive, but the damage that anxiety does to your health and well being is not something to save money on. \n\nHeart/stroke related anxiety is one of the most common. That\u2019s how your body reacts. You can really easily get fixated over that and feel that more often and often. It\u2019s all in your head. Your brain is trying to save you and it\u2019s misinterpreting your symptoms.\n\nConsider checking also if the pain is actual heart or it\u2019s the muscles around ribs/chest. Muscles become very tense when anxious. Try doing good and relaxing things to your body - whatever works for you - warm baths, meditation, breathing exercises, calling a friend/relative, taking a walk or riding a bike. \n\nEverything will be alright. These things pass and things get easier. Seeking for help is the biggest and more important step and you took it by posting here. \n\nTake care!",

When was the last time you ate? \n\nConsidering you also mentioned that you had periods of no eating frequently, your \u2018gut brain\u2019 is probably sending signals to eat, but ironically it\u2019s the exact same \u2018gut brain\u2019 that can switch it off\u2026which is the nausea. So if you haven\u2019t been eating regularly enough your stomach is trying it\u2019s hardest to get you to eat\u2026but your brain is also rejecting it. \n\nAlso, is there a window of time where you feel hungry and then nauseous? In my experience, I get hungry but if I take too long the nausea kicks in. Try putting some food in your mouth while distracted, like a video.  Eat smaller, digestible and frequent meals instead of big meals you have to work towards mentally.\n\nEat more fruits and veggies, somehow even when I have absolutely no appetite I can still mentally stomach them, thereby have the ability to eat them. Hydrate as much as you can, electrolytes too (which can cause nausea if you have an electrolyte imbalance!) \n\nKeep in mind that, if this keeps going for a week+, you may need to check with a doctor or a specialist. Even though it steps from your emetophobia and anxiety, your body may need some extra help. We can\u2019t get better mentally if our body lags behind.",

I get very anxious and stressed, also derealization, but no sweating or similar things that happen with panic attacks\n\n\r  \nHey reddit\r  \nOver the last couple of weeks, I've been having some type of panic or stress attacks. It's a weird feeling, it often happens when I'm sitting somewhere that I can't really \"escape\" from, for example, I had one a few weeks ago at my great grandmothers funeral, and I had one when I was seeing a movie in the theatres with my school. I get really scared and anxious for some reason, but I don't have any other symptoms of panic attacks like sweating or something similar. I just feel super scared of nothing in particular, maybe some sort of claustrophobia, although I didn't really have any claustrophobia before this. I also have derealization when this happens. It al started around 2 months ago, when I was sitting in biology class and one of my classmates went into a sort of epileptic shock or something similar, where he sort of passed out and wasn't in control over his body. When he woke up he said it was because he was thinking of something really graphic in his head (we were learning about pregnancy and child birth and there were a lot of really bad pictures). Ever since then, I became super scared of having the same thing happen to me, and every biology class really became a battle, with me trying to stay calm. Luckily, after a few weeks we began a different subject, and those moments were over. But then it started happening outside of class, whenever I was sitting down and couldn't \"get out\", at the funeral for example, but also yesterday when I was attending a college introduction seminar with my dad. There are also some things in my personal life going on right now that definitely don't have a good impact on my mental health, but I don't really think that they are related. I hope that someone can give me some advice or a diagnosis of some sorts, because I really don't know what to do. The more they happen, the more I think about them and the moment the thought crosses my mind that I could one of these \"attacks\" later, I'm fucked.\r  \nThank you everyone for reading this!",

Or at least sitting in places you have to be in for a long time that is close to an exit? \n\nAlso, it might help notifying your teacher that you might get up and leave from time to time during the class to get some air due to how you\u2019re feeling, there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. In fact, you can do it whenever you want. Know that you aren\u2019t trapped, and can always excuse yourself. Do what will calm you down if it gets too overwhelming.",

                "body": "This is common. When we have anxiety, the logical part of our brain completely slows down and let's our limbic system (fight-or-flight) take the wheel. It's also why some people get brain fog when they get anxious. But there are ways to help. \n\nTry writing down what aspects of your life you're overthinking about (Work, General, Social etc), write down bullet points of:\n\na) What are you worried about? What made you no longer 100% sure?\n\nb) Is there anything you can do about those worries, if so, what? If not, what would make you accept that you can't do anything?\n\nc) If you wrote anything for b, set yourself goals to work on them. Reward yourself. \n\nThe point is, avoiding it is exactly why anxiety happens tenfold. Our brain doesn't want us to go through what it thinks is a jungle full of snakes and will do whatever it can to prevent us from doing so. Writing it down, which requires functional thought will help your logical part of the brain take the reigns and eventually you will be able to break down your thoughts, which can help you not feel scared anymore.\n\nIf it's overwhelming, just start with to-do lists for the next day. As for decisions, I'm also a naturally indecisive person. I either go for the \"rock-paper-scissor let fate decide\" route or make a pros vs cons list in my journal if it's something more serious. Or ask a friend for advice. \n\nYou will get through this. What you are going through makes sense in the frame of anxiety. You just have to be patient with yourself, and learn that it's perfectly okay and you WILL find a strategy that works for you.",

I took a nap today (by accident) and awoke shaky.  Thankfully, it was light and went away after a short while.",

        "timestamp": "2024-03-03 14:45:48",
        "body": "Hi everyone,\n\n24M\n\nBefore telling you the story, I want to state that I will start therapy again soon. I posted the story here before, you can find the story below.\n\nUPDATE 03-03: I guess I can\u2019t do anything about everything here below. Several people told me this can all be psychosomatic but I have a hard time believing that. How can psychosomatic symptoms be things like buzzing leg on just on side and muscle twitches on one side and having a constant head pressure for 2 years on the side of the head that controls that side.. That muscle weakness in my left arm and leg are real, not measurable maybe but real. I believed for so long that this was psychosomatic, why did I believe that.. it gets harder and harder to think nothing is going on.\n\nI feel weird. Why didn\u2019t i push for referrals years ago when these things started. Maybe I would be better off now if i had done that. I guess that\u2019s all just not important anymore. I would really love to live until i\u2019m 95 and die of old age. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s going to happen for me. Maybe this is the downside of having severy anxiety, maybe the doctors never took me really seriously because of my anxiety. \n\nNow I have a neuro appointment in June, I hope that\u2019s not too late. At this moment I just hope I have something that can be fixed. This was the original story: why am I telling this again? Idk, maybe because I still have a little bit of hope..\n\nAfter an emotional traumatic experience 2 years ago I got an onset of symptoms. I discovered an immovable, rock hard lump above my collarbone on the right side that I still have today and completely freaked out. I have a history of severe health anxiety and OCD. Scheduled an ultrasound for this lump and it showed nothing abnormal. However, in that meantime I developed neurological symptoms. Under the symptoms I will list my anxiety story. Got a neuro referral for my peace of mind, but I can only come in in June for an appointment. The I\u00e1 neurologist thinks it can wait and the waiting lists are long (Netherlands).\n\n\\- Mild hemiparesis (that\u2019s what i think it is) in my left arm and left leg. GP said she couldn\u2019t measure it two years ago and 2 weeks ago I went there again and she couldn\u2019t measure it again. I do feel it\u2019s there, feels weaker than the other side. Feels like a tiring feeling even when I sit down. 24/7 there 2 years straight. Sometimes I can feel it a lot in my calve and at other times it\u2019s more the glutes or the upper leg. My left arm also feels more tired and whenever I lean on my left arm or left leg I get a pins and needles feeling that comes way faster than if I do that on the right side. I also get these muscle twitches throughout my body but also more in my left leg and left arm. Since a week my left leg also makes this buzzing feeling that i can feel on and off as if a phone is buzzing there.\n\n\\- A right sided head pressure that\u2019s also constantly there 24/7 2 years straight. Feels like something is pushing, sometimes I get small little stabs but most of the time it\u2019s just the pressure. It\u2019s dull and mostly a 4-5/10. Gets worse sometimes when working out or bending over, but not very bad. Never really got me bedridden but it\u2019s just always there. Isn\u2019t worse in the morning, doesn\u2019t wake me up from sleep and never made me vomit. It tends to subside sometimes to a point that is a little pressure but it never goes away completely. Since a week I also have it on and off on the left side..The right side always stays. Of course my health anxiety now jumps to the conclusion that something malignant spread to the left side too now.\n\n\\- Since a year ago I have this on and off distorted smell. I suddenly get a weird smell in my nose and everything gets distorted. Fragrances become unrecognizable, but a banana for example smells the same. Had covid in august 2022 and this came on around april 2023. Often i smell a kind of chemical smell. This comes and goes during the days. The weird thing about this \"parosmia\" is that it goes away after I sleep and then it comes back during the day. Also going outside seems to trigger it more, sometimes when I stay inside for the whole day it doesn't really come. I can smell smoke sometimes, but that also came on after reading about phantom smells. Today I woke up and smelled smoke, but my fiancee didn't. When I went to another room it seemed to subside.\n\n\\- eye twitching on the right side (same side as the head pressure)\n\n\\- Eye floaters since 5 years. I have quite some floaters, but always thought it was due to my nearsightedness.\n\n\\- Today I woke up from a weird scary dream with an immense pressure on the left side of my head. I couldn\u2019t move, my jaw was moving and the only thing I could think about was to get out of that. After a few seconds i managed to snap out of that and was left with a pressure in my whole head that subsided after a minute. This all happened in the process of waking up. Google said a seizure wouldn\u2019t cause someone to consciously snap out of what was happening. Also didn\u2019t have moving limbs or something.\n\nStill my head is afraid that was a seizure and everything spread throughout my head and im dying soon\n\nI\u2019ve had sleep paralysis often when i was a kid but that was years ago and I dont know if this matches SP. i am under constant severe mental stress over the last years.\n\nMy mom had severe depression when I was just 5-6 years old and she suffered from that for 4-5 years. This was a very difficult time for me where I developed OCD. I had the need to constantly check thing like if my doors were closed, if there was no monster behind my door, checking if all doors were locked etc. This was really hard for me and the ocd kept on developing. In 2013 my father died of leukemia after being sick for 2 years, this was extremely hard for me, my mom and my sis. Our family left us alone when I was little, so now it was just me, my mother and my sister. We found out that my dad left us a lot of debts, so when I was 14 I started working to help pay off the debts and do groceries. My mom and sister used to argue every day during that time and the only thing I wanted was for everything to be OK and my mom and sister to not argue. I completely forgot myself and didn't want to cry about my dad's death because then there would not be stability in our household. During this same time I had this toxic girlfriend that cheated on me multiple times while I knew, but I just stayed with her because i felt loved and I needed love. I stayed with her until I was 19 years old and then she left me because of my mental state. Started to develop bowel issues that are there daily and today still. These are:\n\nCramps and i saw some pencil thin stool in the toilet for the first time in the beginning of 2019. At that time, I also had lots of colon spasms in my lower left abdomen that felt really weird. I don\u2019t have this very often now.\n\nI started to stress a lot and went to my GP. She ran some blood tests, asked about my symptoms and told me it was most likely IBS (rome criteria). The symptoms always stayed and I always had this type 5/6 stool that was very sticky and smelly. Until today this is still the case and I\u2019m freaking out.\n\nOver a year ago, I was constantly checking my stools to see if i could find blood (health anxiety here and OCD). My GP said to stop obsessing about this and I never look at my stool since a year because I\u2019m afraid to see something and freaking out again. I thought I had blood sometimes, but my GP told me it looked more like undigested foods. One time last year I noticed a large amount of blood on my toiletpaper, but that was the only time. Sometimes when I wipe I do see a bit of red mixed with the poo on the toiletpaper or a streak from a fissure. Sometimes the blood is \u201cdry\u201d and definitely from a fissure or something but sometimes there is a small liquid bit of red/tomato red on the toiletpaper.\n\nMy symptoms now are:\n\n\\- constantly sticky and smelly stool and mushy\n\n\\- need to wipe multiple times\n\n\\- lots of gas, really a lot of gas. These often start directly after eating. Gas pain also occurs.\n\n\\- Often discomfort in my abdomen that alleviates when passing gas or stools. Most of the times it\u2019s not really pain but more a discomfort.\n\n\\- Lots of gurgling and splashing sounds in my abdomen- Lots of gass when passing stools-On and off discomfort under my left lower rib area that feels like pressure. Sometimes it\u2019s gone for months now it\u2019s there again since a couple of days ago. It\u2019s always the same place and it tends to radiate to my back and hip on the left side. When it is there, I can always feel that pressure on that place, it can sometimes stay for weeks. Like a nagging constant discomfort in that area\n\n\\- Never a real solid poop\n\nI have this small lump under my left testicle that I discovered 1-2 months ago. It seems to be attached to my epididymis and used to hurt a little but now not anymore. I am getting an ultrasound next week to check this out but my GP thought it could be a cyst or something. However, I read that colon cancer can also metastize to the testicle and this is freaking me out of course. \n\nIn 2019, I moved out because I needed my own space and I was starting to argue a lot with my mom. Financially I was just in deep shit and I started to get more debts and got depressed. Hung out with the wrong people and my life was literally miserable until I met the love of my life (who is now my fiancee). She helped me through this and I payed off all my debts and the relationship with my mom became better. I had some derealization symptoms in the past, but since the end of 2020 they really prominent and hard to let go. I had some therapy in the past and it gave me temporary relief. Now I'm starting therapy again and I want to really work on my trauma's.\n\nI constantly feel disconnected from myself, I hear myself talking and have the feeling that I have no control over what I'm saying. Sometimes I have difficulty understanding what the other person is saying and I get deeply sucked in my own thoughts. I don't know who I am (i do know my name and age etc ofcourse but not who I really am), looking in the mirror is very strange, I know the people around me and I know who everyone is but everyone feels like a stranger. I'm just really scared that I'm very sick and that everyone these last years just linked it to anxiety. I feel so sorry for my body because it is trying so hard to keep me alive and at the same time I'm giving it a very hard time. I love my body, but we're totally out of balance. How can I ever feel normal again.\n\nI saw that brain tumours could cause the neurological symptoms including the smell sensations (temporal lobe) and the depersonalization. Since I have the pressure on the right (and now sometimes also on the left side of my head) I figured it could be something in the temporal lobe and now i\u2019m very scared. I saw that this lobe can produce OCD, olfactory hallucinations, anxiety, depersonalization. I'm scared of having a tumour in my brain and losing my mind/get a psychosis. I had severe suicidal intrusive thoughts 3 years ago, but not because I want to do that but because I was afraid of losing control and doing that. I got treated for that, but now these intrusive thoughts are coming back and the difference is that now I'm afraid of a brain tumour and don't think I can control those thoughts and actions where 3 years ago I felt I was in control.\n\nGP said brain tumour symptoms don\u2019t just stay so subtle for so long. I'm scared to death. I'm completely devastated. I live together with my lovely fiancee, we bought a house that will be ready in June and we will marry in July. I'm constantly in a fear that I will not make it. I love life so much and I don't wanna go yet, I am so scared.",

You should be proud of yourself.\u00a0\n\n\nAs for medical things and medical anxiety - I am not a doctor - not your doctor and not a doctor in general, and this is not a medical advice in any way - but I hope my experience could calm you down a bit.\n\u00a0Some things you list - like floaties - I have experienced them too. I got very bad ones during the pandemic, with astigmatism on top (like all objects have bright aura and are visually doubled), and though they are scary and annoying, from what I get they are pretty harmless. 3 years from when they've started - and I hardly notice them. In my case, the worst case scenario was the doctor suggesting to get astigmatism glasses :) But general advice was to not strain your eyes too much with the screen and let them rest.\u00a0\n\n\nIBS or things like gastritis are very manageable, and I've also got them. It can be a good idea to chat with gastroenterologist on how your stomach pains can be helped. If you are concerned with blood in stool, your gastro could also deal with it. Sometimes even a diet change makes a big difference - for example, for me excluding sour and spicy things was life changing, it even reduced my anxiety dramatically as I stopped having painful acid reflux,\u00a0 but it's all very individual and it's always the best to chat with a professional on your specific case.\u00a0",

        "body": "Hi, I live in Canada with my wife and two daughters.  My wife has anxiety that often gives her serious panic attacks, but is largely \"anxiety about anxiety\".  She some years ago before we met lost a job and it gave her severe depression that really seems to have caused her some kind of trauma.  She is generally underlying worried about being in that state again. \n\nThe sequence is usually she has some kind of stomach problem, a stomach ache, which triggers her to start worrying about being anxious, which then makes her anxious, and then it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. She fully knows there's nothing to be anxious about, our live is otherwise just normal, and she gets very frustrated and angry at herself for getting anxious, though I tell her not to be so hard on herself. \n\nShe's tried neuro cognitive therapy, where the therapist has said she needs to \"let go\" and not worry, but when she gets anxious, she starts worrying she's not \"doing it right\", which again makes her feel like she's failing at it, and again restarting the loop.  She knows the techniques, but finds it very difficult to emotionally *do* them.\n\nWe talk a lot about it and I do what I can to help, but she also feels like relying on me to calm her down is a form of \"failing\", and again runs the risk of making her even more anxious. \n\nCoginive therapy seems very logical and structured, she's been doing that for a few months, and she's doing her best to take it in, but she doesn't really seem to have a way to internalize or \"think away\" the anxiety in the moment.  I get the impression even the therapist isn't sure how to get it to \"stick\". If anything, when the Coginive method doesn't work, she feels like she's failing to \"do it right\" , and that makes her very anxious and upset. \n\nI don't know if I have a specific question, other than I'm really trying to help and unsure where to turn.  For someone who gets easily stuck in an \"anxiety about anxiety\" loop, are there other things to try here?  Other forms of therapy specifically suited for this kind of thing? \n\nI don't have a history or background in being anxious like this myself, so I'm a little naive in how to help other than just being fully present , supportive and calm.  If there's any approach or mindset I should take in general, that is also useful. Much thanks. ",

        "body": "My diagnosis is GAD (amongst non-anxiety diagnoses) and I lived with it without realising it wasn't just normal life until I was \\~20 (22 now). I have had two therapists semi-long term since starting to get help and they both reached the same conclusion but both seemed a little perplexed by it, as if it's not a very common thing to do.\n\nBasically I consider my anxiety medium-high depending on the day/ situation, not always disabling but it certainly gives it a go sometimes. I get panic attacks but they're rarely ever triggered by a single/ obvious thing. It's more a build up of stress over days that ends up needing to be released as I go.\n\nI stress about everything social, even with my closest and most trusted friends I struggle with believing that they like me, or at least aren't annoyed at me. Obviously this is so draining but I keep putting myself out there. Occasionally I do have to stay in/ not do something because of anxiety but most of the time I try to push through it. For a long while I used substances to avoid the hell of socialization but obviously not sustainable or really that helpful. But even without them I still put myself through this.\n\nI know exposure is meant to be helpful but it never makes anything better for me. My therapists have pointed out how it's strange that I expose myself to my fears so much and most of the time nothing goes wrong but it never gets any better. Really don't know what to do or how to even improve this. Can anyone else relate to this? Feel quite alone in it as none of my friends get it and therapists/ nurses have been a little confused by it",

        "body": "I (21) yr old female have had asthma since a baby and it used to be rly bad like waking up not being able to breath and being rushed to the hospital. As I have gotten older I haven't had an asthma attack in ages but I picked up some pretty bad habits and up until about 3 years ago I realized I was self medicating because I'm severely anxious and an over thinker. The past 2 years have been especially hard and I have been to doctors and emergency room and even called an ambulance tonight because I just feel like I can't breath and every time they just tell me I'm perfectly healthy and it's all in my head. I find my self constantly trying to get a deep breath of air and it just feels like I can never reach the bottom of my lungs this feeling gets even worse when I quit smoking nicotine so it's made it rly hard to stop.when I feel I can't reach the bottom of my lungs it makes me even more anxious as I'm so scared to have an asthma attack and I find my self yawning and trying to get a deep breath almost all day.\n\nI recently have been thinking about getting on meds but am also scared of all the side effects and honestly just not being myself any more I don't know how to cope and I've tried therapy once when I was younger and it just felt so dumb to me I'm not sure how anyone can survive feeling like this all the time so i figured I'd come on here for some advice. \n\nSide note I'm also 7 weeks pregnant so I'm even more nervous about  asthma problems once I'm further along someone plz tell me what to do \ud83d\ude2d \n\nSide note..I'm also feeling sick as well with congestion so that is not helping either \ud83d\ude1e",

        "body": "Hey all,\n\nI suffer from general anxiety disorder and panic disorder. I had it under control for years but in the last year it\u2019s gotten unmanageable. I talked to my doctor about it and she had prescribed me lexapro 10mg and Xanax .5mg. \n\nI started the lexapro and took 5mg the first day and it was good. Second day was fine (started the full 10mg). Third day I felt off and ended up having a horrible panic attack that day and had horrid anxiety all day. Days 4, 5, and 6, I felt completely awful. Horridly increased anxiety, and felt like I was having low blood sugar episodes(headache, tingling lips, dizzy, and lightheaded so bad that I thought I would pass out any time I got up) I was also so weak in the arms and legs and was bed bound all 3 days. Drinking juice usually made me feel better for about an hour but that\u2019s all I could try because I have no appetite at all. I gaged at the smell of toast even. The morning of day 6, about 2 hours before I took my med for the day, I woke up and felt awful and went to get a glass of juice. I almost passed out on my way back to bed. I called the doctors office and told them about these side effects and they had told me to discontinue the lexapro due to these side effects I was experiencing and that they have called me in celexa to try. They informed me that if someone has really bad side effects with one it may not be so bad with another. \n\nI filled my celexa (10mg) prescription 3 days ago and I\u2019m terrified to start it. I\u2019m so scared that I\u2019m going to have the same things happen again. I can handle the nausea, and sleepiness, but the thought of having those lightheaded dizzy spells that make me feel like I\u2019m going to pass out scares me like crazy. \n\nHoping for some words of encouragement or maybe someone who also had a bad time on lexapro and a better time on celexa to ease my mind.\n\nThank you in advance for any responses!",

Long story short I metabolize SSRIs too quickly (a test done via cheek swab) so I was constantly feeling withdrawal-like symptoms. I was switched to Wellbutrin, which is not an SSRI, and it helps me so much. I don\u2019t get any negative side-effects from it. It helps give me this little boost of energy and happiness which curbs the depression. I still have my moments, though. But it truly does help me a lot.\n\nSometimes it takes some getting used to when it comes to antidepressants, but if the side-effects are really bothering you I think it\u2019s worth bringing it up to your dr to see if maybe there\u2019s another option for you - which I\u2019m sure there is!",

Whenever I have a bout of extreme stress and anxiety my body does go into this fatigue dizzy weak mode for days but this time. I have dry eyes as well and last week almost saw screen almost 15hours a day. My anxiety is convincing me its some brain disorder and reading about aneurysm didnt help at all. Can anxiety manifest such symptoms? I feel like I\u2019m losing my mind. Pls did anyone with anxiety have such issues with vision etc? \n",

To start, there\u2019s nothing to distract me, and it makes it harder to go to sleep or back to sleep. my thoughts, just wandering anxiety increasing. But the weirdest is when I wake up, anxious about things that don\u2019t even give me anxiety. Probably sounds like I\u2019m contradicting myself, so maybe an example would be better.\nI was incredibly anxious in the middle of the night, because I couldn\u2019t think of the name of a book I was missing in the series I was reading. Of course because I was half awake. I didn\u2019t think to just check for the name.   Not remembering the name of a book does not give me anxiety during the day or evening, but apparently it does in the middle of the night. What gives mind! I was trying to sleep ",

But now, I\u2019m not so sure of what happened and so I tried to text the girl and asked if she had had her period yet in the last couple of weeks, but she seens me.\n\nFor context, she\u2019s ignoring me as I asked her about contraception and initially she said she didn\u2019t have any, then proceeded to say a week later that she had the injection, so my anxiety/overthinking immediately thinks she\u2019s lying on the second part. I then asked her another time and she said she got angry and asked me to stop contacting her. \n\nWhat can I do? The only way I feel I can currently calm my anxiety is by getting an answer out of her to make sure she\u2019s not pregnant. I feel like I\u2019m mentaller blocked right now and no matter what I do, my anxiety takes over and I start panicking. \n\n",

So my surgeon was quick to identify it as GAD and referred me to a psychiatrist. My family being Indian, does not allow therapy and medication \ud83d\ude2d. I been DEALING with it since then and it has come to a point that I have chest pains for the last 2 months with reports coming out normal but I feel fatigued, scared of what may happen, head feels heavy, chest pains, flutters and stuff. \n\nMy GP prescribe Lexapro 5 as he thought that this dosage would do but my family did not listen to him , my psychiatrist prescribed Zoloft 50 but that too has been blocked out. And ALL these months, I obbsessed over my health being a hypochondriac and I ruined my exams \ud83d\ude2d, it's of no use, I'm getting into the same uni I was last year, it's all wasted with me being uncertain about my health. I don't feel safe going out anymore, meeting with friends and the things I used to love doing in the past. I'm always uncertain. EVERY night for the last 1-2 weeks as soon as I'm about to fall asleep I wake up 20-30 panicked cause of some strange chest/upper abdomen pain and it takes 2-3 hrs to fall asleep. I barely get 4-5 hrs of sleep after which my father wakes me disreagrding that I'm sleep deprived. I was so well prepared, so sure that I will do it this time but all in VAIN! as I could not study properly the last month, sudden weaknees, pains and stuff have made going about every day very difficult for me. \n\nMy parents now think \"He did not prepare well that's why he's anxious\", \" he's seeking attention\" , \"he's over-reacting\" \"He's creating a scene\" I honestly don't understand how will I go about this. \nHave been obbsessing over measuring my pulse, have had VERY negative thoughts. Fuck it! I don't know I feel so lost and overwhelmed. \n\nNow its know that I have Hypochondriasis. \nMy family thinks meds are for weak people and even people who seek mental support are weak and they cause infertility.

        "body": "Hello!\n\nAbout four months ago, my (29M) partner (31M) went for a check-up for something unrelated and found out he has high blood pressure. He's now started meds and we've completely changed our everyday diet and started being more physically active. His numbers are looking better already, even if they're still a bit high, and he's going to regular check-ups to get this under control. Great!\n\nBut I can't stop thinking about him dying. Every moment I'm awake and not completely focused on something, I'm panicking about it. Leaving home for any time at all without him has me convinced he's dead or dying (I still leave home, it's just horrible the whole time I'm away). At night, I sometimes lay awake to make sure I can hear him breathing. I have some of the worst intrusive thoughts I've ever had. It's been like this the majority of these four months, with a couple of periods of a few days when I have some relief, but it seems to come back very quickly.\n\nI'm autistic and I have GAD. I imagine I might be in some kind of crisis that started with the news about partner's high blood pressure. Like I was reminded of his mortality and now it's consuming me. I'm seeing a therapist and I'm on meds for the anxiety. I have and actively use the usual tools they tend to recommend, like distraction, just sitting with the feeling, acknowledging the thoughts and letting them go, \"checking reality\" to see if my fears are probable or not, keeping up with regular sleep/food/exercise etc. I do my very best to keep doing what I usually do, to keep structure and stay on top of things.\n\nI think I'm doing what I can and that time will (hopefully) heal whatever breakdown I'm in. It's just so difficult to be in it. Death seems so close, and I have a hard time being okay with not being okay. The thought of not getting to grow old with this ray of sunshine kills me.\n\nHugs are appreciated. Thank you for reading.",

(adhd or anxiety? I have no idea). but also theres a lot of THINKING.  \n theres the typical OCD mental compulsions like thinking neutralising thoughts or repeating the same concept again and again to make sure I remember it - but what if this is just anxiety developed due to ADHD?  \n anyway for example when I meet friends my ind is still just going 1000 mph.   \n3) I cant stay organised for the life of me - but again what if its just the anxiety depression blah blah   \n4) I wash my hands a lot throughout the day - idk if this is really contamination thing though so im really confused - but ofc, im thinking while doing it  \n5)  my showers usually last an hour or more because im just...thinking...the entire time... it sucks.   \n6) I have nearly a thousand notes on stickies and the notes app each, because I just keep typing everything that goes on in my head all day - idk if this is OCD hoarding or anxiety due to adhd forgetfulness. like literally I have conversations with people and as a habit I write it down immediately after (the entire convo) idk why butwdjkf aksdjhfsdf   \n7) I repeatedly cancel on meeting friends  \n8) I google shit 24/7 a loooot and also I think I have themes which I overanalyse a lot till im not sure what it is?? OCD???????  \n9) my parents have called me lazy w a lot of potential since childhood - same for teachers   \n10) was managing school fine till HS  \njust to add - I really really want to do in well in school but I just...procrastinate...and cant???? but theres people partying and getting the highest possible grades while having a perfect social life and then theres me with NONE  \ngod I just dont know anymore ...

        "body": "3 months ago i started getting weird random pains throughout my body. first it was a tight / heavy chest, varying from the middle to both sides. rib pains. brain fog. tingling in my face and head. arm and leg numbness / pins and needles. eye sensitivity / pressure. face pressure. weird empty feeling in my chest. upper back pain that seems to go through my chest. and sometimes my right ear will start to hurt. \n\neveryone i tell about this says it\u2019s just my anxiety. but i will feel these sensations even when i\u2019m completely calm. i had told my doctor a couple weeks ago and he dismissed it as anxiety. (i am diagnosed with panic disorder and i feel like he never takes my concerns seriously) last night i had the worst panic attack i\u2019ve had in a while, and was fully convinced i was having a stroke. i took a xanax and after an hour i was calmed down and feeling normal again. if the xanax helps, does that mean it really is just my anxiety? it\u2019s been everyday constantly. it gets in the way of life. i don\u2019t feel normal. i literally get so scared i convince myself there is something seriously wrong with me. \n\nplease tell me if anyone else is experiencing this??!!

                "body": "Your doctor is correct, it is more than likely anxiety. Even when we aren't actively anxious/panicking our body is still on \"high-alert\" mode due to excess cortisol, adrenaline, or whatever mocktail it came up with because we're anxious. As for the numbness, it could be that your blood pressure spikes on the regular daily due to anxiety, and your blood vessels are constricted in those areas. If it will calm you down, go for a physical if you think your doctor doesn't take your concern seriously, preferably a different doctor or even a specialist like a psychiatrist. \n\nIf Xanax has completely removed those symptoms, they are more than likely psychosomatic. Are you on regular, long term medication for your panic disorder? \n\nAlso, for your current physical symptoms, you might have to experiment with methods that help you. When I get back pain, chest feelings etc, doing stretches and walking, getting the blood flowing helped a lot.",

So if this happened again, it won't hit as hard purely because you just went through this. \n\nAlso as hard as it may be, it's good to make peace with the fact how it can happen again. As that leads to your brain to stop bringing it up if you accept that possibility. And it's good to add how it would be no big deal if it happened again. It would just make you even stronger anyway.",

Which is crazy because normally I eat a LOT and I love food and eating lol. Basically the fight or flight responds shuts down areas of the digestive system as a defense mechanism as blood is needed more for the heart. That's why you'll lose appetite or have cold hands and feet because all the blood gets sent to the heart and other areas needed to \"flee\" a \"dangerous\" situation. Biology is lovely, isn't it? Sigh. Once the stressful period is over, appetite will naturally return.",

So\u2026increasing my appetite in general when I am not feeling anxious helps with my (loss of) appetite when I am anxious.\n\nFor example, I was skipping breakfast as a rule for a long long time regardless of whether I was anxious or not ( I figured intermittent fasting is good for you and what not), but then I started having breakfast regularly again ( something I started during periods of low anxiety). This had two fold benefit a) I gained a bit more weight, so had some buffer to loose when I am anxious and b) body got into a higher baseline for appetite so when it did lose some during anxiety, the impact was still not as bad. \n\nThis \u201cpeace time\u201d habit building strategy seems to work for other things too, like exercising and meditation.",

        "body": "Hey there, i need you options and help, am lost, what would you do or what should I do in my case.\n\nI've been struggling with something, and I could really use your perspective on it. Lately, I've been feeling like I might be dealing with depression, but then I start questioning myself. I tell myself it's impossible for me to suddenly become depressed, and maybe I'm just being overly sensitive and blowing things out of proportion.\n\nI keep thinking that because I'm a teenager, my feelings aren't real and are just a result of hormonal changes. It's like I'm convincing myself that I'm deluding myself with depression. At the same time, I know I should appreciate my life because there are so many people who would trade places with me in a heartbeat.\n\nI used to believe that we've become more sensitive as a society, but now I'm not so sure. Online, I see all these conflicting opinions about depression and self-improvement, and it's making me doubt my own beliefs and experiences.\n\nOne of the toughest parts is that I don't have anyone I can truly confide in or who understands what I'm going through. I can't even seek professional help, and it's weighing heavily on me. Plus, I feel this pressure because of my religious background, even though I'm not particularly religious.\n\nReligion holds significance in my life, though I'm not particularly religious. Suicide goes against the sanctity of life in my faith, which deters me from considering it. Despite not being deeply religious, these beliefs still influence my moral compass and deter thoughts of suicide.\n\nI just wish I had a real, trusted friend or family member to talk to, someone who gets where I'm coming from. And on top of it all, my dad's negativity and constant complaints are really getting to me. I miss the old him, the happy days with genuine friends and a loving family.\n\nI've also noticed I've forgotten about the things I used to love, like hobbies and habits. And these endless headaches and burning eyes are driving me crazy. It's like I have tears in my eyes, but they won't come out, almost like my pride is holding them back.\n\nI know it's a lot to unpack, but I'd really appreciate your thoughts and advice on this. Thanks for listening.",

                "body": "Health anxiety. Ik it all too well. Anything i felt that didn\u2019t feel right or anytime i felt sick i kept thinking, it\u2019s over this is it. Chest tightening, difficulty breathing, trembling, Heart Racing, all of it. \n\nIt\u2019s funny because before all this happened, I was a thrill seeking, confident, not a care in the world person. I wasn\u2019t this worried, anxious person, whom at every symptom i felt, I thought i was going to die.\n\nTbh i started getting anxious because for the first time ever last year I got a panic attack. Everything I listed in the first paragraph is what i felt. I was so tired and scared for a week straight after it, i thought i was finna die from a heart attack. That\u2019s how it all started.\n\nWhy was i scared? I was born with a heart condition, never has affected me before, doctors even said I\u2019ll live a completely normal full life like everyone else. Every year i was checked up on growing up, 100% fine. Maybe i was too young to understand but growing up i became more health worrisome.\n\nCouldn\u2019t go outside, shop, eat without having a panic attack. That first one haunted me. Every day heart palpitations, which anxiety made it worse. It sucked, it really did. I\u2019m sure I don\u2019t have to explain that but it really does suck, all those symptoms I felt were indeed real. Felt throat getting tighter, out of breath, all of it \n\nGot checked up with the doctors because obviously I thought something was wrong, they said I\u2019m 100% good, nothing wrong. Suck that\u2019s anxiety made me believe that they missed something lmao. Only thing they noticed was that my nose was extra congested. It\u2019s took about 5 months for me to stop getting panic attacked every day, but yet my body still was anxious, I would randomly get anxious even though Ik I was fine.\n\nMonths later, after finally convincing myself I\u2019m fine, the breathing issues became more and more apparent. This ofc lead me to believe even more and more, they missed something I\u2019m going to die. Went back about my nose, doctor literally said \u201chow are you even able to breath\u201d, got sent to the ENT and they did their magic. Surgery specifically, now I can breathe again! As soon as I got that surgery it\u2019s like all my worries went away.\n\nHad to wait for that surgery, so I went months waking , couldn\u2019t eat without suffocating. It\u2019s crazy that the body knows when something wrong.My body would constant be anxious and be in flight or fight mode because it knew I wasn\u2019t getting any air.\n\nSorry for the ramble but from what I experienced, you can indeed cure anxiety. I\u2019m not 100% back to where I was before but I\u2019m sure as more and more days pass I do indeed get better. I would say I\u2019m indeed curing my anxiety.\n\nPeople say anxiety \u201cis all in your head\u201d which is half true. The anxiety part mentally \u201cthat\u2019s all in your head\u201d is the fear of the thing you have. For me it was thinking I was chronically ill and I was doomed to die. Having that fear of what makes you feel how you feel, the symptoms basically. Me thinking I was finna die at any moment, made my body go into flight or fight mode. That\u2019s the part of anxiety that is real, the feelings. \n\nAnxiety IS CURABLE. Whatever you\u2019re dealing with I wish you well, I\u2019ve been in that dark deep pit before. Don\u2019t rush yourself, just remember at the end of the day, you are going to be fine, you are going to wake up tomorrow, you are going to wake up the next week, month, year. The biggest thing that helped me is to LIVE IN THE MOMENT, what\u2019s happening now it\u2019s the only thing that is real! Good luck!",

        "body": "Hi everyone, I am a 21F university student that has just been diagnosed with anxiety and depression after 3 weeks struggling to get out of bed mixed with panic attacks probably caused by trying to cope smoking weed. I was started on 25mg Zoloft 3 days ago and my doctor warned me to look out for signs of underlying bipolar because my paternal grandmother has it and sometimes anxiety meds can trigger it. She asked if I had any previous experiences with extreme highs along with my lows and I said no but I have been thinking about it more and I have been known to do some overzealous overcommitments when I\u2019m feeling well that I then have to back out of when I\u2019m feeling depressed again. I don\u2019t really know if that could fit into the category. I have a lot of health anxiety in general due to past experiences with chronic health issues so I know that I often will try to convince myself that I have something. However, I now can\u2019t sleep and feel very energized and sweaty. I haven\u2019t slept in about 23 hours so far and I don\u2019t feel tired in the slightest. I have spent the past few hours catching up on a ton of school work, online shopping, and cleaning my room. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m just starting to feel better or if this could potentially be a manic episode. I would call my doctor but it is Sunday and they are closed. Am I just worrying about nothing or is this a genuine concern? ",

I don't know if you already do this or not, but I would write down any weird sensations you are feeling as they happen. I know for me I get nervous at the doc and forget some of the feelings I wanted to convey. I haven't dealt with some of the exact things you are mentioning, but that is my two cents.\n\nHope that helps, best of luck.",

You know, the decimated bean/powder stuff that you simply add hot water to. It gives me a nice boost in the mornings for an hour or so (I'm always tired).\n\nLater, in the evening, I might have a cup of tea which helps too. Anything more than that, and my brain immediately goes onto alert mode, like it's overstimulated, thus making me extremely anxious. \n\nAnyway, I'm rambling. What I've noticed is that, whenever I have a coffee from a barista, it makes my anxiety go nuts. Sometimes I have bad panic attacks because of it. I'm guessing because it's obviously stronger. \n\nToday, I had a mocha from a coffee shop around three-four hours after I had my first coffee. \n\nIt's a stupid mistake I keep making, but I thought a mocha wouldn't be that bad (I usually get a cappuccino). While I didn't have a panic attack, about half an hour after I drank it, I had the worst anxiety symptoms. Jitters, racing thoughts, twitching, thinking I was going to die, sweaty palms, feeling a panic attack coming on (but managed to stop it) etc. \n\nIt took a few hours and some food to help me calm down. But I honestly don't think I'm ever going to have a coffee shop coffee again, lol... unless someone knows a low-caffeine coffee I can have. /hj\n\nThey just make me feel awful. ",

Some people say GP - honestly, I\u2019m not very fond of my doctor and the idea of speaking about this to him, so\u2026\n\nShould I contact a therapist or psychiatrist? When I look on PsychologyToday, I find myself totally confused with how many different titles people have. Counselor, Social worker, nurse practitioner, LCSW\u2026.. how do I know the difference and how do I pick who would help me best?\n\nI understand most therapists are not qualified to prescribe medication. I honestly get the feeling my case would need something like that, but I don\u2019t know. Will a therapist recommend me to see someone for meds early on if I seem to need them?\n\n",

                "body": "Psychiatrist's are M.Ds. They are able to diagnose mental disorders and prescribe medication. Sometimes it's a mix of general psychotherapy and medical treatments. \n\nTherapist's are mental health professionals, and are largely qualified for many areas. For example, Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (helping you to identify unhealthy behaviours and beliefs, and replace them with positive ones). \n\nCounsellors provide solutions to personal problems. They focus on one aspect of your life such as addiction, loss and grief. They are usually good for when you have a specific issue causing anxiety, and would like help with it. \n\nSocial workers are similar, but are mostly there to support you and direct you to services that they deem you need.\n\nFor your case, considering you are unsure that you need medication. I will recommend going for a psychiatrist. They will diagnose you, understand your situation and if necessary, provide you with medication. Of course, medication is a bandaid, not the fix. They may advise you to also seek out a therapist. Usually when it comes to mental disorders you may have more than one support individual behind you, like a support system. Your therapist will be in close communication with your psychiatrist, and vice versa.\n\nPersonally, I've been with my psychiatrist and therapist for 5+ years. I am required by my university to also talk to their counsellor to specifically help me with my studies when my anxiety flares up. \n\nI hope you are able to find one ASAP!",

Stupidly i decided to take a very strong edible at the end of jaunrary ended up having a massive panic attack ended up in the ER. everything was fine. except that since then i\u2019ve had extreme anxiety like never before. Got into CBT about a week and half later bc it was so bad and i was scared. Panick attacks don\u2019t happen rlly at all anymore, for the first month it was honestly me being afraid of having another one. Now it\u2019s me being bothered by my symptoms of anxiety and my health. especially my heart. some physical symptoms i have are : hot/cold flashes, numb body, a tiny bit of vision issues when i\u2019m super stressed, knee tingling, balance issues etc. list goes on. And honestly i\u2019ll be fine when i wake up in the morning until i realize \u201chey im feeling really good\u201d and then im not bc im thinking ab feeling good. tbh when im feeling normal ig im so used to feeling hyper aware and stressed that when i feel normal i think soemthing is wrong and send myself right back into stress mode. i\u2019ll rlly feel like im passing out sometimes too but i never do. cbt is slowly helping i can tell. But these physical symptoms are just fucking with me. I\u2019ve stRted to get to the point where it\u2019s like \u201cokay this is what this is you\u2019ve felt it before this anxiety ur good\u201d and that can help it be less intense and easier to get by, but sometimes i\u2019m too worried so still working on that but definetly better. But man the one thing that\u2019s rlly fucking me is this adrenaline or maybe like i said it\u2019s just my anxiety being high, but that high energy, my eye twitching, me talking fast and tripping over my words. my mind and body are ready to go go go and i just wanna feel normal again for more than just half the day ",

Had panic attacks daily, etc. Try thinking of anxiety like this. You said you wanna feel normal but when you do feel normal, you immediately start thinking about it and start panicking.\n\nThink about how you breathe though your nose. You do it automatically, not a thought about it. As soon as you think about breathing, you start controlling it, exhaling and inhaling, if you focus on your breathing and breaths, you control it. Controlling your breathing makes you anxious because you\u2019re manually inhaling and exhaling. \u201cIf i stop manually breathing, ima suffocate\u201d. So how do we stop manually breathing? We stop thinking about manually breathing, we distract ourselves with something else. Notice as soon as you focus on something else, you start breathing naturally. Eventually your mind takes over and you start breathing automatically and you don\u2019t even realize it.\n\nAbout the adrenaline you feel, it\u2019s normal.\nBeing anxious is basically having a fear of something. Lemme give an example, imagine your in a building that\u2019s on fire and you have to get out, you clearly see the smoke, feel the heat, smell the ashes. Knowing the danger you\u2019re in, you hurry to the exit for the safety of your life. Your body puts you in adrenaline mode to get you the energy to get you to safety, it\u2019s simply your body doing your best to protect you.",

When you panic your body goes into fight-or-flight and force you take short shallow breaths. \n\nI want you to try breathing as deep as you can, feeling the breath go straight to the bottom of your belly. Feel the muscles expand as you breath in. Tell yourself that you are okay, that your lungs aren\u2019t failing. Breathe out through your mouth or nose, whichever is more comfortable. Slowly, like blowing a candle. \n\nWas there anything that triggered you prior to your lungs? Do they always feel weak, do they hurt when you breathe? Often times stress, especially chronic stress can manifest itself in our chest, causing the sensation that we aren\u2019t getting enough air, which can cause panic and make our breath shallow.",

I obviously still live with my parents right now but i get paranoid at night semi frequently even with meds and fear break ins and even supernatural events though to a lesser extent. I covered a hole in my blinds that faces my bed because id find myself staring at it and imagining things outside in my yard. I keep a bat near my bed & my phone on me at basically all times but my parents being here is also a source of security as well as our dogs despite them being small and non threatening. Im scared that once i live alone and have no one to wake up if something does happen or to blame noises on ill become even more paranoid and probably fall into ocd like behaviors when it comes to checking locks & stuff. I really want to move out because my parents can get really annoying but i dont trust myself to not go insane with paranoia",

                "body": "Ooouu yea! Story timeeeee: In December my blood pressure spiked to 163/91 because of my stress. I had an online appointment and was told to get checked in person. When I finally went in I had the WORST doctor in the clinic. So when I saw the nurse I let her know \u201chey yea so I get anxiety I\u2019m actually anxious right now so if you can leave the door open I\u2019d really appreciate it.\u201d and she was super nice and accommodating. Then here comes this terrible doctor HANDING ME A PAPER BAG. \u201cBreathe into this\u201d and closes the freakin door. I told her \u201cwhy?\u201d And she said \u201cyou\u2019re having a panick attack\u201d I infact wasn\u2019t havent a panick attack. So then that upset me and instantly instead of address my issue she started going in about connecting me to A CRISIS TEAM &\u2019 connecting me back to my therapist even tho I had already talked to her the day before. So that instantly made me upset and I started crying and then actually nearly having an anxiety attack. &\u2019 I told her like \u201ci just want to go home\u201d and SHE HAD THE AUDACITY TO SAY \u201cthen whyd you come?\u201d I said \u201cbecause I was having high blood pressure and I was told to get checked in person that\u2019s the only reason I came\u201d and then she started saying she can\u2019t let me go home because she feels like I\u2019m not okay. I had to wait till she checked my blood pressure again and had to convince her I\u2019m good that I am obviously fine when I\u2019m home and that I have terrible anxiety no matter where I am if I\u2019m outside because I was super agoraphobic at the time &\u2019 yea I had my therapist call me again to see what happened lol",

So then I have a follow up with my OB and I just start panicking and sobbing to her thinking I'm dying and I'm gonna die and leave my two kids behind and she is trying so hard to reassure me that the blood work actually normal because after pregnancy, your heart is working harder to try and get rid of excess fluid.

I know I'm in good hands when my doctor cares about my vulnerability.\n\nIn a weird round about way it's very rewarding for me to see my providers reactions to their care and commitment working. My doctor figuring out it was my gallbladder and seeing me wake up better than I've been in a year? He had a sparkle in his eye. I know he went home feeling good. I want to be better for everyone, including the people who want me to feel better.\n\nBut yes, I have ugly cried many many times. My neuropsych and his nurse are the safest people to cry with, because they'll fix it.",

I've been diagnosed with GAD/PAD since I've been 14 so 30 years. \n\nI'm prescribed with 0.5 mg Klonopin two times daily and have been for many years to control horrible panic that would strike me as soon as I woke up, gnawing, senseless fear which followed me all day and and kept me waking up at night. \n\nMy insurance is with a major corporate hospital with many different locations. They are very firmly anti benzo so my psychiatrist (who I found before I got this particular Healthcare) is from outside the network.\n\n My surgeon for some reason chose not to augment my daily Klonopin and just assumed it would control any panic attack. That's bullshit. I should have been much better sedated when I arrived to the hospital.\n\nOne of my major triggers is needles. The prep nurse came in and attempted to run a catheter into my vein in my forearm. Despite 17 years of a strong yoga practice, I hyperventilated and freaked out right in front of my surgeon. The nurse kept trying, she stabbed me over 12 times. My arm was black and blue for a little bit over 2 weeks. All this and there was a perfectly usable and easy to get vein in the fold of my elbow.\n\nMy wonderful anesthesiologist said they could just wheel me into the OR and then gas me before they ran the iv.

I had to tell her I have anxiety and so she left and brought the doctor in and he luckily calmed me down fairly fast and changed the subject off my bp and at the end of the visit he checked it again and it was 130/88 which is still high but proved to him it\u2019s all anxiety induced and that I don\u2019t look to have high blood pressure that needs medication.",

I physically recovered quickly, but my mental health became a huge struggle. I saw my doctor a few times during that period (for unrelated minor things) and saw my therapist weekly. With my primary care doctor, she would start our visit with \"How are you doing?\" And I either immediately started crying or got a few words out, then started crying. \n\nNothing to be embarrassed about at all! You're human and it can be emotional to talk about your health.",

                "body": "Not really but I've gone to the emergency room and walk-in clinic multiple times in the last several months knowing full well I am having an anxiety attack and telling them overtly that's why I'm there. Being embarrassed about it is kind of like being embarrassed about having a stomach ache.\n\nI realized something while writing that last sentence though. It's not a great comparison because an anxiety \"attack\" traditionally refers to a behavior more than a feeling whereas a stomach ache is the feeing that might cause \"behaviors\" such as gas or moaning and hunching over in pain. But if you were in that much pain would you be embarrassed about it? Would you be embarrassed by your outward expression of the pain caused by a kidney stone you were having while you stumbled into the emergency room? Or your pathetic wheezing and obvious red puffy appearance when having an allergic reaction? I've gone into the emergency room for all three and I can't say any one of them is embarrassing at all.\n\nThe next step of course is overcoming the embarrassment of admitting to others that you were embarrassed. Perhaps that's been the hardest part for me so far. A lot of times I'm still afraid to acknowledge when I'm embarrassed because it feels like a true weakness, so you beat me there. It does seem to slowly decrease with time though....\n\nThe step after that though, and the step I'm on, is overcoming the anxiety caused by the realization that there is no clear distinction between psychiatric conditions and physical conditions. I guess it helps to know that even though anxiety is a physiological response to some largely unknown combination of xenotoxins, even the worst cases are still a lot less likely to kill you than the most other physical ailments.\n\nBut anyway, I have GAD so my voice is always a little shaky when I talk to doctors, which has embarrassed me a lot in the past.",

        "body": "I have had anxiety, for I would like to say about a year and when it first started, it all started with my heart rate I obsessed over my heart rate and every little thing about it. I have been to the ER approximately 4 times I have had EKGs two week long heart monitors, and of course they came back clear and I decided to change my life around and start reading more working out more and just being in control of my mind and that seem to have really worked for me and I had a good control on my anxiety, I would like to say about 2 months after that two months, some stuff happened in my life, and I fell off of track with my things to help my anxiety. After that once I finally knew my heart was OK and I stopped worrying about my heart rate. My new trigger became my stomach. Yes, I used to obsess about any in every pain in my body I have thought multiple times that I was dying it could have been from appendicitis it could have been from any other type of eternal bleeding. It also jump to my lungs. Any pain I got in my chest, I thought my lungs were collapsing, it was such a bad experience. Thank God I got over it and I was able to push myself to learn about these different things that I was worrying about and was able to get over them and I would like to say about 4 months ago. I started getting irregular heartbeats and what I mean by that is I\u2019m assuming extra heartbeats, but it has its sensation of skipping heartbeats. All I know is that it is anxiety and I have learned to deal with them. I occasionally still get them but that\u2019s not what I\u2019m writing this post for, sorry if this is a lot of yapping I just want to speak my mind but to the point of this post a little brief self description I am a young kid 18 years old and I have thought I am dying damn near every day I feel so embarrassed to have to ask other people to solve my problems for me but I have read through a lot of the post on here and it honestly helps me a lot knowing that I am not alone and I don\u2019t need to deal with this alone but the stuff recently that happened and what is my new trigger is of course my blood pressure I have always had a good blood pressure of 100-120/70-80 now I would like to say about three now I would like to say about 3 days ago I started getting anxiety and randomly my dumb ass decided to check my blood pressure and to no surprise in the middle of a panic attack. My blood pressure was about 164/100 now, of course this sent me into a state of panic and in that state of panic, I thought to myself, let me try and calm down and take it again. I then tried to control my breathing and focus on not stressing out and took it again and to my surprise, it dropped dramatically I would like to say about 146/89 which then made me not worry now don\u2019t think I have not taken my blood pressure while having anxiety before because I have but I have never worried about the bottom number and if I\u2019m being honest, that\u2019s the only number I\u2019m worried about right now. I took my blood pressure just a little bit ago when I was having, a panic attack or could even say just a lot of anxiety and it was 132/100 now again it\u2019s the bottom number that concerns me. I don\u2019t know what to believe on Google anymore. Google has lied to me so many times and made me look crazy but even with that being said I\u2019m still scared. I worry that my blood pressure is too high, and I am going to die, like I know a lot of other people worry about who have health anxiety. I have accepted that I am a hypochondriac. I just need some reassurance. Do I worry about the bottom number or do I not and another thing I want to say I am somebody who wants to face anxiety head on and by myself with no medication\u2019s. I have tried all sorts of medication\u2019s but I\u2019m tired of it and I want to be able to be in control of my life so if anybody could help or give advice or even just read, I would greatly appreciate it.\n\n\nI also want to say if you are somebody reading this because you\u2019re going through similar things, I want you to know don\u2019t be afraid to reach out. There are very many good people who will help or give advice or anything like that if you are somebody who is newer to having anxiety or if you are somebody who is just like me and worries about everything just know you need to live in the present and stop worrying about the future. Your brain can either be your best friend or your enemy don\u2019t let your anxiety control you I know it\u2019s hard I\u2019m not one to speak because I go through the same but that doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t take my advice god bless and take care.\n\nAnd im sorry if i did not put this in the right tag im new to this so please bare with me\n",

I don\u2019t think a therapist can fix me or anything, but I\u2019d just like to be able to go and sit in an office on a couch and be honest with a stranger about how bad I\u2019m struggling with my anxiety and infertility and everything else right now.",

Then, as COVID calmed down, people began to get help for the mental health issues they had developed during COVID and\u2026you have our situation now.\n\nThis seems especially true if you live in a big city, or an area where therapy is more acceptable. \n\nIn my opinion, the state/governments need to help more people to be able to complete Master\u2019s programs to become therapists. We\u2019re expected to do our internships for free while still paying for school. Who can afford that? You see how prohibitive this field can be. :/\n\nAnyway, OP, it\u2019s not you, it\u2019s the system. Good luck on your search.",

It wasn't what I wanted but I LOVE my therapist and am improving so it worked out. \n\nPure speculation here: It's also because of your ADHD. I probably have an attention disorder. I say probably because I had to give up on getting help/ a diagnosis for that to find anyone to talk to for my other more critical issues. Several local specialists near me currently have a policy of not taking any new cases for ADHD or only taking appointments for children. The one that was willing to put me on a waitlist said clearly they do not offer any medication as part of ADHD treatment and the other options for treatment are limited. \n\nReasons that come to mind for why that is: \n\n1- there are a lot more people seeking out ADHD diagnosis and treatment. Meaning there are not a lot of available appointments. \n\n2- ADHD right now is a pain in the butt for providers. Between demand, increased media attention, increased regulatory attention, insurance wanting to not pay for tests and treatments, drug shortages, etc. Everything surrounding ADHD is a lot right now. Putting extra risks and stress on providers. A lot just don't want to deal with it and are closing their offices to new patients. \n\n3- A lot of medical providers have left the industry/ are taking sabbatical. There is a healthcare shortage. I've been denied  appointments for other medical offices because of lack of staff. Therapists are no exception. Again leading to less available appointments. \n\n4- Telehealth does not offer a lot for attention disorders because they cannot or do not (may be specific service dependent) have the ability to prescribe controlled substances. \n\nIt's a bad situation all around and I've got my fingers crossed you find someone soon.",

I have been on 40 Mg of Citalopram for about 12 years, it helps a lot but I still get AM anxiety (sometimes it doesn\u2019t leave until 4 pm). ",

                "body": "Watching events unfold over the internet or TV is very emotionally detached and impersonal. It doesn't help that there is always something evil or depressing happening somewhere, and news media profits from covering the most emotionally taxing stories available. I wouldn't worry about being on autopilot for stuff like that, I think we kinda have to be at this point, for better or worse. \n\nPersonally I just try to avoid it as much as possible. Focus on what is happening directly around you that you have control over. For me it is overwhelming enough to have to handle emotionally taxing events within my family and friends, but at least I may have some control in the matter.\n\nAs much as it sucks to be so emotionally invested in things that others may not be, I'm glad that you are. I believe it hopefully makes us better people and more understanding of those around us.",

        "body": "Hi everyone, I am Denz (M20). I have a situation, a problem to be exact. I experience seasonal emotions. Just like the weather, my emotions change based on what month it is (weird af).\n\nJanuary is when I'm most productive. I get things done early, I organize and make myself available for everyone, but fortnight of February my mood starts to change. The first week of March is the most difficult time of the year for me. I start to become anxious, weird, and socially awkward around people. I would either isolate myself or hate on everyone. This would continue till the end of May.\n\nBut, after May, my mood starts to recover. I socialize a lot, make friends, and become productive again. This will continue til October. The entire month of November, I would sulk and become cold to most people just like how I am during the month of March-May. Decemebr, I recover again and become semi-priductive, and the cycle repeats itself.\n\nThis problem started in 2019, when I was still in high school (now freshman in college). I have my guess on what triggered these changes in my mood. There was a time when a former high school classmate told me, \"You will never have friends.\" A phrase I will never forget. I could still vividly remember the day and how it happened. It was February 24, 2019, at exactly 10:00 in the morning. We fought because of a misunderstanding, and one thing led to another. I think this event in my life left a wound that has yet to heal, resulting in my seasonal mood changes. \n\nBecause of this problem, maintaining friends became a lot more difficult and a challenge for me. I honestly wish that this problem would go away. \n\nThis leads to my question: Is the phenomenon I'm experiencing right now a thing or not? Am I overreacting on things? Do other people experience similar situations? I hope to hear your thoughts about this cause I'm also considering getting myself checked. \n",

I would recommend therapy to help you flesh out your anxiety, discover the root causes of it, and learn the tools needed to help quell those anxiety episodes. I'm not sure if your anxiety tends to confine you to home, but if so, I'd recommend Teledoc or some other similar Virtual therapy session, right from the comfort and privacy of your own home. Also, when Anxiety is that bad, it is also worth considering consulting your Primary Care Physician and asking about anxiety meds. It can make a world of a difference!  \n\n\nI truly hope you take some steps to mitigate the anxiety. It is not easy to deal with, to say the least. Would love to hear updates about how you're doing as well.  \n\n\nAlso, I'll throw out three songs that either deal with the topic of anxiety specifically, or may soothe your mind with cerebral/inspiring lyrics. Sending positive and calming vibes your way! You've got this!  \n\n\n[Anxiety by The Vanishing Point](https://soundcloud.com/user-326384011/anxiety?si=595388ff9e754cb0b4cfd4aafefe9d21&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing)\n\n[Grateful by The Vanishing Point](https://youtu.be/8ycLCu8L-_U)",

Your body will LITERALLY tell you when something is MEGA WRONG, as in it won\u2019t be simple small pains, more as in your body will literally MAKE YOU FEEL ACTUAL PAIN. You ever had a cold? Your body makes it clear that you\u2019re sick, making you feel weak, hot headed, and etc. Did you ever have an infection of some sorts and it\u2019s gotten bad? The pain is clearly there.\n\nI basically just started thinking saying that, if the day that I truly got something deadly, my body will clearly let me know, not just a simple pain in my chest or something like that, something like SEVERE CHEST PAIN can\u2019t move type of thing!",

        "body": "*TLDR: I'm struggling very badly with my mental health but meds take away my imagination and creativity entirely (I'm an artist and need it as my job).*\n\nI'm in my 30s and I'm back once again living with my family because I can't function like a normal person, and because of how bad my mental and physical health are I also can't manage a normal job. I've also been having such enormous amount of stress and anxiety for many years now I fear my heart might give up at any moment if I keep on going like this, and the rest of my diagnoses do not make it any easier on me.Lately my OCD has been beating me up so badly, most of the time I can't even fall asleep from all the constant unrelenting horrible thoughts. I'm going through the day half asleep and so out of it I sometimes can't even form coherent sentences. When I do get sleep, it's so poor and I wake up so many times I never get to feel rested. PTSD is also relentless.\n\nI have been working on making art my full time job. The problem is, whenever I've been taking meds, they have always taken all my creative thoughts out of my brain and it makes it pretty much impossible to work on anything. Once I stop taking them, my head starts to slowly clear up after a few days until I can eventually draw again. This has sadly cost me many years of not being able to do my job properly.At first my previous psychiatrist didn't quite believe the meds could take away my creativity, but it has happened every single time with all the different meds they have given me. My current therapists have acknowledged it and know it as a fact, and I've heard about other artists, or even book authors, struggling with the same issue whenever they had to get on medication, making it very hard or near impossible to accomplish their jobs.\n\nI recently started doing very poorly with my mental health again, I'm in a very dark place and it's affecting my (already poor) physical health, so my therapists have decided it's best I get back on yet another different medication.I was ready to start taking it, but the day I was about to do so I started freaking out so much about the side effects (I always struggle a lot when starting or dropping from meds and get the worse side effects) but mostly the fact that it will be almost impossible to get any art done, let alone keep making it work as my job. And so for two weeks now, I've been so anxious at the thought of taking the meds, it's even taking my sleep away (as if I needed more things in my head).I know worrying about the meds side effects doesn't help, but after trying so many different medications I know exactly how it's going to affect my art, and after so many long breaks from my art it freaks me out so much to get onto yet another break and not be able to make a living for myself.\n\nI feel like a failure, useless, keep spiraling down and never seem to get better. I haven't accomplished anything in life other than art.I'm working on getting some disability help, but even if I manage to get some help, I would still need to work to somewhat make a living. And so that's why I'm struggling so hard with my meds situation.I'm obviously not doing well, at all, but at the same time I don't want to get stuck again even if I'm losing my sanity.\n\nAny kind of advice is welcome. Just don't be too rough on me, I've had a lifetime of that, and I'm already ashamed of admitting to all of this. I'm my own worst enemy.\n\nIf you're a fellow artist, please tell me about your personal experiences. I know some people are still able to be creative while on meds, while for others it's impossible.",

Humans are designed to make connections even if there is no connections to be made. Sure your symptoms may be similar but anxiety can cause a whole lot of other symptoms. Rather than seeing Dr. Google, go see an actual doctor. Let them know your concerns and get checked out. A helpful tip is don't immediately disclose the fact that you have anxiety or panic attacks so they will rule other things out first.",

        "body": "Yeah long story short, I was born with anxiety probably from my mother. My dad was unfortunately very strict and had a lot of anger issues due to childhood trauma. Mainly his dad hiting him and his mom and my dad stepping to to stop it. I feel like he had a lot of rage in him and was also moody.\n\n\nThis unfortunetly was a toxic way of growing up. Whenever my dad would yell or hit me, I realized I would shut down compleatly. I'd be emotionless and the lingering thought and reminder of him yelling and hitting me would linger for days making me just numb and in shock. I as legit afraid of my dad and my dad saw me shutting down as a good thing. A job well done.\n\n\nOnly now do I realzie that this fucked me up. That lead to me having lots of rage and anger that I never properly expressed. When I was a teenager, this anger started to manifest and I went from being quiet to just moody. My anxiety got worse and I started to dissasociate a lot. I was never really there mentally. Being lost in my mind was my safe place and I quikly started to depend on it. \n\n\nEventually I went to college but again I made no friends and was just in my mind. My parents wanted me to do well and despite failing I was still given the oppurtunity to go to college. I somehow graduaed at 26. \n\nI'm 28 now and I still struggle to hold a job due to anxiety. I'm on meds and was suppose to see a therapist but my stupid clinic messed up on the appointment and out of frustration I decided not to go. I'm still taking meds and seen an improvement but still. I struggle.\n\nI smoke weed and me being high gives me revelation and insights like this as to wtf is wrong with me. Only now am I starting to realize my dad fucked me up but I know him well he will never admit to it. In his mind It's my fault but I desperately wish he would understand the impact his words and violence had on me. I wish bad shit on him and it hurts. I personally feel done. I'm tired, I know I'll never be able to be like most people because I never had a proper social development and its all due to my father not being able to build a healthy family and keep his emotions in check.\n\n\nI also feel bad for my mom, she didn't really quite deserve my dad. They legit didn't even know each other before getting married. Only through letters. In case you're wondering my parents aren't from the US and are from some village in mexico where poverty leads to a shitty and stresfull family dymanic. I know my mom resents my dad but my dad managed to do quite a lot and family see him as a role model and I'm just caught in between trying to figure out if he is a good person or not.",

I suffer from GAD and emetophobia and am currently on the waiting list for CBT to treat my emetophobia and will eventually move on to CBT for my GAD as I plan on not being on medication forever.\n\nMy doctor agreed with me that I can try the propranolol on its own for a week (1 to 3 pills a day) and see how I get on and then start taking the escitalopram once daily if I feel like the propranolol isn't enough. I am also going to be trying melatonin gummies before bed to help with sleep (hoping there is no bad interactions between any of the 3).\n\nJust hoping to hear some success stories and/or advice from anyone who has been on the same medication as me.\n\n***Please refrain from mentioning nausea and/or being sick as it will trigger my emetophobia immensely.***\n\nThanks!:)",

                "body": "Hi there! I can only comment on escitalopram not propranolol sorry! I've been taking escitalopram for 11 years now I think and definitely find it helpful. 7 or 8 years ago my doctor suggested adding bupropion as well and for me the combination is much better so I haven't been on just escitalopram for a while if that makes a difference to anything I say!\n\nPersonally I didn't get a lot of side effects. When it was initially prescribed to me I was told I could take it at night if I was worried about side effects because then I'd sleep through most of them.\n\nIt might help to track your mood while taking it at least initially. I really struggle with comparing how I feel now to how I felt before so when the doctor asked if I thought I was feeling better I had trouble answering even though now I definitely know this is better lol. Also good to keep an eye on your mental state while taking it at first, not every med works for everyone. My little sister tried escitalopram too but it seemed to make her really upset so her doctor is trying some other options.\n\nHope this combination works for you but don't worry if it doesn't, your doctor is there to help you find what works best for you and you'll find it!",

The medication I'm on is for anxiety,weight loss and for people that want to quit smoking. And I can tell you that the medication has done it's job not only for anxiety but for weight loss. If you have tried several ways to get over anxiety I highly recommend getting on medication if you think it will help you. If you think medication won't help you then that's fine. Do what ever helps you with your anxiety. I needed medication because I'm Autistic I have Asperger's Syndrome and I heard Autistc people are low on the feel good chemical serotonin. And anti anxiety medication gives that to you. I feel so much better being on anti anxiety medication. Does anyone else feel the same way?",

I\u2019ve noticed something odd over the past week or so- I started getting brain zaps after taking my lamictal and buspirone. Like, the same kind you get when you\u2019re withdrawing from meds. \nI looked it up, and I learned that some people experience this side effect with buspirone, but every report I saw was from people who had just started it. \nToday I took the two medications separately with a good window of time between the two, and I pretty much confirmed it\u2019s the buspirone. \nI\u2019m so confused because nothing like this has happened in the years I\u2019ve been on these medications. How is it happening now?! (More or less rhetorical, I\u2019ll ask my doctor too, but I digress)\nMy primary question is\u2026.has anyone else experienced this, specifically after having been on it for a long period of time?

I sweat A LOT (hands, feet, groin since I was a kid), and of course when it's hot or I'm at the gym, and when you sweat you lose electrolytes. If you don't mind food coloring, try Gatorade 1-2 times a day. Potassium can be bought on Amazon or any over the counter pharmacy. **Make sure you tell your dr you plan on taking potassium** and I would not take more than say 500 mg a day (you need around 3000-4000 mg/day from food sources). Get a blood pressure device at home, monitor your heart rate and blood pressure, take some potassium, see if that helps with the palpitations and to lower any BP where the 2nd diasolic reading is over 90. Goal is to get the 2nd reading in the 80's or maybe even 70's. Potassium is not hard to correct. Don't drink a huge amount of water, supplement with potassium MODERATELY, check your pulse and blood pressure a few times a week.",

When I think of driving, my heart beats so fast and my brain would show dark scenarios about me getting into an accident again. I feel like Im not made for driving and I'm so tired of getting a ride from my dad. Like, why can't I just suck it up and drive like a normal person? \n\nMy biggest fear is to hurt other people. I couldn't care less if I get hurt, but I wouldn't be able to bear to harm anyone.\n\nAny advice?",

        "body": "Sensations, thought process, whatever you want. I had one today while with my kids at a play place and barely pulled it together. I was journaling while the kids were playing and when the panic attack started my standard process is to chew an aspirin (just in case), and take a Xanax. For usual to moderate anxiety I break a .25 in half and this works. For panic attacks I need a .25 whole. I couldn\u2019t take a whole because I needed to get us home. \nI pulled out my journal and wrote everything I was feeling along with the waves as they were coming and a few time stamps. The worst of it was 20 minutes, but it lasted about 45 min - at least until the Xanax started working. Mind you this is a tiny dose so it was like grasping for a straw in a deluge.\n\nAnyways, I cannot bring myself to transcribe and relive everything now but I\u2019ll try and circle back and post it in a comment later on.\n\nAnd in an hour I need to connect to work and run some maintenance on two servers. Yay me. My poor wife is wrecked with anxiety because of this. I didn\u2019t want to tell her it happened but 15 years later \u2026 I cannot bs my wife because it\u2019s all over my face and behavior. I\u2019m just so emotional right now that I\u2019m somerhere between feeling panicky and crying. I feel horribly guilty for putting my wife through worrying and stressing about me, about me with the kids and having an episode while out and about with them\u2026\n\nAnd now as the massive amount of adrenaline is being processed by my body \u2026here come the PVCs. FML.\n\nEdit: I always think I\u2019m having a heart attack during panick attacks. I have what people have called in here Cardiophobia.",

My hands will start shaking and then I\u2019ll get full body shakes. I\u2019ll feel so uncomfortable that I feel like I need to rip my skin off. I\u2019ll hyperventilate as well. I\u2019ll feel like I\u2019m having a heart attack and that I\u2019m in imminent danger of dying. I also have Xanax for panic attacks and once it\u2019s over and the medicine has kicked in, I\u2019ll have lingering chest pain and get extremely exhausted. I\u2019m currently on a path with my doctor trying to find an SSRI that will work for me as I also have general anxiety disorder. I had a horrible experience with the first one I tried and am scared to try the second one because of this but know I need to try because I can\u2019t handle the daily anxiety and frequent anxiety attacks. I also sympathize because I feel awful for my partner, I always have him listen to my chest to tell me my heart sounds like it\u2019s beating normal and just feel awful about this being my new norm. He reassures me all the time that he\u2019s here for me and will support me no matter what but I just feel so bad that he\u2019s always worried for me as well. That\u2019s another big thing motivating me to get meds right because I want to feel normal again worse than anything I\u2019ve ever wanted and I also want him to not have to worry anymore. I wish you the best of luck and hope you find what you need to start feeling better as well \u2764\ufe0f",

I\u2019ve read so many accounts of people saying they feel like zombies. They food even tastes blander, than all feelings and emotion are dulled. Mostly I fear getting panic attacks while my body adjusts to it. The panic attacks for me are constantly evolving and the spectrum of somatic symptoms is in constant flux and evolving, which really throws me off. I had one good day yesterday and I felt almost manic! I\u2019m not bipolar, I don\u2019t mean to offend anyone. I was high energy, a chatterbox, o in a good mood, I still got some chest and left arm sharp pains and still hyperventilated here and there but my mental state was such that I was able to brush it off. I chatted my wife\u2019s ear off yesterday. I was actually able to laugh at a comedy we watched after the kids went to bed. Like belly laugh. I rarely do that anymore. And as I was expecting, today came the crash. And then panic attack. Oh god\u2026"

She said chronic severe stress looks almost identical to addiction in the brain. Stress releases CRF, and high levels of CRF-the brain responds by taking away dopamine receptors. So the severely stressed person needs higher levels of dopamine to experience pleasure.  I think this can manifest as exhaustion (I\u2019m not a medical professional). I think it takes time for the receptors to get healthy again.",

Everything. Else. First. \nAnd I'd advise you to search on Reddit for experiences with weed, CBD, etc. and anxiety - it's not a good idea IMHO.

        "body": "I am a healthy 53 year old male in good health. My whole life I have battled anxiety but it centered around health and hangovers. If I drank too much the day after was a day full of skipped heartbeats and hot flashes with thoughts of collapsing where I stand and dying. I have not drank in 7 years and although I\u2019ve smoked marajuana for IBS at times, I\u2019ve never done any other drugs. 2 weeks ago I experienced some sharp chest pain that lasted just a few seconds but went on for a couple days. After visiting the ER at my wife\u2019s direction it was determined to be stomach related. The next day I woke up in a fog with my mind going 1000 mph.\nThoughts of death, sickness and hospitalization that quickly lead to a solid theme\u2026\u201dyou\u2019re going crazy and losing your mind\u201d Why can\u2019t I stop this line of thinking? I wake up with sweaty feet and hands and these crazy intrusive thoughts about \u201cnever being normal again\u201d and falling off the age of sanity. This is scaring me to death. I have been taking Lexapro for over 15 years and was prescribed Hydroxizine yesterday but after taking one this morning it zapped all my energy and I could barely keep my eyes open. This is making life hard to enjoy\u2026..am I alone!",

I knew I was being triggered, and I felt like I wanted to take a break, I just wanted it to be over and to go home. \n\nSince I couldn\u2019t figure out some of the questions, and was struggling to do them all, I was holding back the urge to just jump out of my chair and land on the floor, even hit my head, and I was shaking while trying to do so, but eventually, when I was almost done, I couldn\u2019t hold it back and went ahead and did just that. Fortunately, not many people were present in the class at that time. And the teacher wasn\u2019t present in the class, one of the workers was keeping watch on his request, while he was out at that time.\n\n",

These sort of illnesses and disorders exist on a spectrum, so even if you don't have any apparent psychological symptoms the fact that you're suffering from the physiological problems of anxiety would probably warrant enough from a psychiatrist to diagnose you with an anxiety disorder of some sort.\n\nAnother point I was thinking is that I would argue that you're still suffering from a mental disorder or illness regardless if it's psychological or not. It's more likely that your physiological symptoms are the result of some disorder you have going on in your brain, not with your adrenal glands. Your brain is the one controlling those parts of your body to begin with.\n\nAlso you could argue that your physiological symptoms has an impact on how you think, feel, and perceive reality. If you're always feeling stressed because of these symptoms then that in itself is enough to denote that you're suffering from a mental disorder.",

        "body": "TL;DR - Alas! Tummy, wherefore art thou, Tummy?\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nI got into my vehicle a couple months ago; I started it up, backed it out of my driveway, and when I put the engine in \u2018Drive\u2019 to begin my journey: the rodeo began. This is an automatic transmission SUV, but it was bucking like the day I learned to drive a stick shift. Illinois and its harsh winters had claimed my two year old battery from Texas.\n\nHello, I am no longer eligible for many types of employment, and my fixed income (combined with my mental status) makes it difficult to handle certain types of hardship. Thankfully, a battery going out isn\u2019t that bad an ordeal, or at least it didn\u2019t USE to be a hardship before my brain slipped. Looking at my dashboard, I realized that my 2023-2024 winter was going to have another challenge.\n\nAlready, the water heater was acting up (more construction down the street means I\u2019ll have to replace this whole dang machine; there\u2019s basically MUD in the bottom of it now), the garage door just yells at me when I try to open it, the bathroom needs new fixtures, the cat poked her sister in the eye, and NOW the car. Great. I\u2019m physically recovering from a back injury just in time to sink money into a car repair. I can feel my torso below my ribs just in time for big league nausea.\n\nLadies and gentlemen (and probably just teenagers online), I made appointments with repair shops and didn\u2019t keep them. I planned to get a new battery and chose to get a jumper instead. Guys, I waited until a policeman told me to repair this car to finally order a battery online\u2026 and then I looked at it for a week. I hardly ate yesterday, couldn\u2019t even keep food in my stomach (literally, and I know this is too much info, but my stomach turned to water all morning). I was feeling jitters about trying to get my life on track and bracing for familiar disappointments/frustrations.\n\nI vacuumed my house. I sorted my junk drawer(s). I set out my tools, my head feeling inflated like a balloon, and I watched educational videos I don\u2019t need to watch just to make sure I had the right socket sizes beforehand. And then\u2026 I walked out to the garage and installed the dang battery. It took\u2026 a couple minutes. The battery I ordered online was the right size. I didn\u2019t drop anything in the engine. I didn\u2019t get shocked. My car sounded like it was taking its first breath of life (good, considering I couldn\u2019t turn on the headlights before).\n\nMy plan was to drive to McDonalds after, but that\u2019s not happening. I walked into my house and almost threw up. Even now, my stomach is like, \u201cgurrrggg-mrrowlll!!\u201d \n\n\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\n not so bad\u2026 not so bad",

        "body": "English not first language, sorry. No therapy here accessible. We have medical doctor to give medication, and I have anti anxiety medicine now. Therapy not here. I am not from Western country, please understand. I save salary monthly, this is low salary but use most to purchase medicine for anxiety and to pay doctor too, but it is hard to afford regular. Therapy for very wealthy and here we have not good pay for work, but even those who work in very professional, for example, my sister as lawyer cannot afford therapy. \n\nI feel very low in mood now, lonely and panic and focussed on long distance relationship but he isn\u2019t with me, I fear losing him. I give all my energy into it, all my emotions and if it ends I don\u2019t want to exist or do it again and be alone. \n\nAll my life I have been alone, no close friendship and only bad relationship with domestic violence and assault and no therapy, no one listen or understand. Here it does no matter about it if your husband will do this. I leave this relationship, it\u2019s over and for years I want to be with a kind, sensitive man, we have not met and it\u2019s my dream. I want it to be real. If this is not real why is this life for me worth continuing? What hope I have? What else there is for me here? \n\nI have been given hope that this miserable life can be better but it seem not real, so i need to return to before? Years of not wanting to be here and wanting to go? As if I am not worthy of anything good or love and that nothing good could ever happen. I am scared of losing it. I can\u2019t soothe myself now while I am feeling panic and have no one ",

Have you talked to them about possibly trying a medication for depression also? You seem to be dealing with severe depression along with your anxiety and if you can\u2019t see a therapist then you should consider medication if possible. If that\u2019s not a possibility then try to find some sort of local groups that you can join and maybe meet some supportive people. I don\u2019t really know your situation or what options you have. It doesn\u2019t help that you have no one to talk to about these things. I hope you find what you\u2019re looking for in life and also find the man you need to be there for you. Loneliness and depression are horrible things and I pray that you\u2019re able to overcome them in time.",

No refills either . Recently I went to a different hospital waited 4 hours to see a doc . Showed him proof of my first script of meds which included the 14 5mg Valium and he wrote me a no refill script for my regular 2 meds and 50 5mg diazepam . My question now is since I don\u2019t have a family doctor currently is it likely that another doc be it even 1 at a walk in clinic will write me a prescription identical to the most recent one that doctor wrote me regular 2 meds plus 50 5mg diazepam considering I have proof of this most recent prescription?",

Well, last night,  my wife walked into the room around 12 am. I had already been in bed since 11 and had fully dozed off and was pretty much asleep. When she walked in, it was like a bomb had gone off in my body. Heart rate was easily 180-200. I was *freaking* out.  I had two glasses of water, did deep breaths, and nearly called 911. After about 10 minutes I finally got it into the low 100s. She kept checking my pulse. Then the full body tremors started. It was as if I was freezing the way I was shaking. I was terrified. I took my 25mg of trazodone I use for sleep, and 20 minutes later they passed and I passed out. I'm 28, and I haven't experienced anything like that in my life. It was not fun. Let's just say I immediately took my prozac this morning, and I don't think I'll be missing it in the future. \n\nI had a few drinks last night, hit my weed vape maybe 2 hours before bed, and unfortunately, I got back into vaping nicotine. I am a former smoker. I'm not sure if a combination of that, being half asleep, and forgetting my meds caused anything. I feel fine today, other than a little spooked/anxious from last night.  Just needed to vent. ",

After my second episode I now get massive anxiety when I go hiking in the woods or driving with lots of trees. Also my kids give me a lot of anxiety. When they\u2019re loopy from lack of sleep at the witching hour *chefs kiss* perfect combo. \n\nI refuse to stop hiking it is a central part of my persona I used to backpack for fucks sake.

This was due to having an awful experience as a child (the hygienist polished my tooth so hard it came out - no, it was not a loose tooth). Well because of that, I have severe dental anxiety, I also have needle phobia. It's so bad that when I finally did work up the courage to go, at 26 years old, I was crying and literally in full blown panic mode while they were doing xrays. \n\nFast forward a month and here we are. I go on Monday to start the cleaning process. I'm terrified they'll need to numb me (is this a thing during a cleaning?), I also have 2 teeth that need fixed that are very sensitive that I'd rather they avoid for now. The dentist prescribed me valium to take before the appointment but I'm still so nervous. They did say they use ultrasonic ( would love some insight on what that's like). I just want to get through this. I want to get on the road to getting my smile back and being able to not have to worry about what side to chew on. I just wish I wasn't so anxious. \n\nIf anyone has any tips, advice, etc, I'd greatly appreciate it :( ",

Also a low thc, high cbd strain helps for sure.",

        "body": "I think I've had anxiety all my life, but it hasn't seriously hindered my capacity to live till I hit my 40s, I've basically stopped working because of it. I've never been medicated for it, especially since most of my life my anxiety manifested as digestive problems, I do remember getting a lot of tests done on that when I was a kid, even a sigmoidoscopy at 20. But once I hit my late 30s the symptoms were definitely more emotional. It only releases now though if I have a full on melt down, though I feel drained after and can't always function well, but I only do it when my husband or my mom are around, no one else, I have a hard time even doing it by myself. Right now I'm home alone for a whole week, and my cat is sick, he's got a pretty bad ear infection with aural hematoma, already had surgery once and will most likely need another one in a couple of days. I also don't live in my home country anymore, so doing \"adulting\" stuff is even more stressful than it's ever been. And I have to handle everything with the care of my cat and doing all the vet stuff on my own this week, and also seeing how much in pain my cat is is really getting to me. I've been anxious for the last 2 days straight, can't eat anything my appetite is almost gone (funny thing, even though my cat feels like shit his appetite hasn't left him, lol, which makes giving medicine to him easy). But yeah, my body feels jittery and everything hurts, I didn't get much sleep last night, and I'm just cold even though it's 20C in my apartment right now. But I can't have a crying melt down because I feel like I won't be able to function after, because I'm \"in charge\". ",

You would immediately think about it. The same goes for things you are forcing your body to do. Your body will act the opposite way.\n\nYou could try Gradual muscle relaxation!\nIt usually calms me and makes me very drowsy. If I don't fall asleep, at least it make me feel relaxed. :)\nHere's the link I use : https://youtu.be/86HUcX8ZtAk?si=niSArCZ5bV7usxvR\n\nI also like using the Medito App for guided meditation. There's also a lot of guided meditations for sleep and very cute and calming bedtime stories!\n\nLastly, if possible, dont stay in bed if you can't fall asleep. Go in another room. Make yourself a herbal tea. Get cosy. Read. Listen to music or a podcast. Do a crossword. Anything without a blue light screen. Staying in bed ruminating on the fact you can't fall asleep will only make things worse.\n\nThere's a great podcast episode of Disordered on the subject. It might interest you! :) https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ZXr9nQITqsocoBVOMtima?si=D_bVuZp3S9evMVNzop2umg",

I can't do online I can't do it at home and I just feel like such a failure. the only subject I could do was math which I find funny because I hate math but any other subject I couldn't do even if I knew the awnser I don't know why I just couldn't write it down I hate it when teachers look at my work or hovering over my shoulder it makes me really uncomfortable and makes me s*cidal.\n\nI cant do my written divers test. the first time I went I almost passed but I was shaking and on the verge of tears and I just can't get myself to do it again even though I want to do it\n\nI can't speak because I go mute due my anxitey and I have no irl friends only online. I never really leave my house because I have no one to hang out with.\n\nI've tryed asking for my mom for help but she said she didn't know where to take me or who to go to and I felt like she could of just did some simple googling so I feel like she doesn't really care. I mentioned meds to her but she said \"do you really want to go on meds just so u can talk\" and she made it sound like it was a bad thing.\n\nI'm worried about my future and I just barley have any hope left for a good life. I really need help and I really want a therapist because I've had anxitey since I was a 5 or 6 and it's only gotten worse over the years. my mom said I'd grow out of it but I still havnt.\n\nI don't know if this is anxitey related or not but  since I was a child I've been a very picky eater and it's gotten worse over the years and I've cut off full food groups such as veggies and fruits. I only have a few foods I'm willing to eat and when I do want to try somthing new I will gag and even somtimes will get nauseous and almost throw up but my mom thinks I'm over dramatic. I'm not trying to gag on purpose or anything it just happens and I can't control it but I wish I could just eat properly because I'm really malnourished \n\nI don't know what could of caused this anxitey my mom thinks it's because she had cancer and I was a bit more isolated from people due to it but I feel like it's more than that. it could be that I got bullied when I was a kid during school or maybe how my mom talks to me or maybe because my mom has always make decisions for me since I could remmebre but other than that I don't know.

While working on a certain part which is always the same every time (it's derived straight from the law which hadn't been changed), I suddenly got the idea \"What if I've been doing it wrong?\". The question came all of a sudden, without me being anxious about that or being stuck there or anything of the sort. My next thought was \"And if I'm indeed doing it wrong?? OMG ALL MY PREVIOUS WORK HAS BEEN WRONG AND CAN'T BE SALVAGED! WHAT DO I DO NOW? MY BOSS WILL FIRE ME AND THE CLIENT WILL BE MAD AS F'!!! I'M RUINED!!!\". I was actually so terrified that I didn't have the courage to just look it up and verify that I was doing it right, and it came so suddenly that I didn't know how to reason with myself.\n\nThe next morning, after a good night's sleep, I took a deep breath and told myself \"It's okay, just look it up\". And, sure enough, I hadn't gotten anything wrong. A couple of days later I went to the office (I normally work from home) and while having coffee with my boss I told him the story. Right after my panic and before I said anything else, he said \"Let me guess: you were too scared to look it up, in fear that you were indeed wrong?\". When I agreed, he said \"That's why I'm usually terrified of looking up court dates, I'm terrified that I will see I missed a hearing\" and we had a good laugh about ourselves \ud83d\ude01",

Before I put the filter on, the faucet was just a hole. I'm worried that we're gonna get sick because there was no mesh thingy on it. \n\nHim: \"Mesh\"? Are you talking about the aerator? That doesn't filter the water, it makes the water flow less intensely. \n\nMe: Oh... I think so. The aerator filters it though too, right? Doesn't it prevent like rocks and other big stuff from coming out? \n\nHim, trying not to laugh at this point: Do you think you'd accidentally drink rocks if you found them in your cup?\n\nMe, indignant at this point: No, of course not! I was just worried because it was just a hole! I didn't expect it to be just a hole! \n\nHim, cracking: Wh... what did you expect it to be... \n\nMe, still indignant: A mesh! And I'm too afraid to drink from it now because it's just a hole! I tried googling it and- \n\nHim, interrupting me: Wait- you Googled... what? \n\nMe: \"why is my faucet just a hole\", \"is it normal that my faucet is a hole\", \"does the faucet filter connect to just a hole\" stuff like that \n\nHim, fucking losing it at this point: You googled \"why is my faucet just a hole\"??? \n\nMe, angry: YES. AND I COULDNT FIND WHAT I NEEDED TO KNOW. \n\nHim, still cracking up: You couldn't find what you needed when you googled \"why is my faucet a hole\"... \n\nMe: NO I COULDNT FIND IT \n\nHim: And you were upset that the water isn't being filtered... before it reaches your filter...\n\nMe: YES AND THAT'S NOT THE POINT\n\nEventually, he told me that the filter comes with an aerator on it already \ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

The mistreatment in this very vulnerable time with no one to advocate for you when you can\u2019t talk can trigger psychiatric illness you never asked for.\n\nI\u2019m still very angry how I was treated and how much I suffered from their shit.

It worked well for a good 2 weeks, until I started ideating again. So she added Fluoxetine to the mix. It worked for a good 3 days, but then I was rushed to the ER because my heart rate shot up to 130s, I had chest pain and hot flushes. Thinking back, I think this was my first ever panic attack.  \n\nMy ECG came out normal, and the gave me medication for the stomach pain and nausea I felt that time. It was a truly difficult 2 weeks after that, as I navigated through constant panic attacks throughout the day. I had dropped Fluoxetine and later found out that I might have had serotonin syndrome (because Ive been taking Tramadol and Pregabalin for my chronic pain too).\n\nNew Years - Jan 3, I get rushed to the ER again for the same reasons. From Jan to Feb, I was rushed to the ER FIVE times in total. They later found out I had GERD and an H Pylori infection. The fifth time I went to the ER, we opted to have me admitted because the chest discomfort, tummy discomfort, was relentless. At this point, I wasn't sure if it was my panic attack or if it was the GERD. \n\nAnd the not having any answer for that also added to my anxiety. But what's most painful is feeling as if you have little to no control over your body, the way it responds, the thoughts caving in. Being defenseless. \n\nI got referred to a Psychiatrist during my stay in the hospital. They've prescribed Rivotril .5 before bedtime, and switched my Mirtazapine to Vortioxetine. They said I might have repressed so hard all these years that its all coming out now in the for of panic attacks and physical symptoms (chest pain, tightness, dizziness, nausea, fainty feeling, hot/cold flushes).\n\nIm honestly scared to take the rivotril and vortioxetine, esp given my exp with serotonin syndrome months ago. But Im getting desperate-- I want my life back so hard but I fear Im losing strength. \n\nSo I would appreciate it if anybody shared a story or two about your experience with rivotril, vortioxetine, panic attacks with physical manifestations, regaining control and overcoming (befriending) anxiety.  Sorry for the long post, I kinda used this whole thing as a grounding mechanism during a panic attack\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

I try to reassure myself that it\u2019s literally only a little over a week and whatnot, but my brain is just freaking the hell out! I can\u2019t seem to calm down. I am certainly not at the point of a panic attack, and it isn\u2019t unbearable but it\u2019s a persistent anxiety I\u2019m struggling with today. It happened the last time he had to visit family out of town, it\u2019s only really for long distances or periods of time. I\u2019m very anxious over It and I want to feel okay. I am currently set up with a psychiatrist appointment next week for this anxious feeling, so hopefully I will be cared for under a professional (not sure yet if medication or therapy etc is best.) but for now I guess I just kind of needs some words of comfort or maybe some advice on being a little less anxious. Also if this sun isn\u2019t good for this type of thing please feel free to direct me so me where better. I just want to feel better. ",

I'm so glad you've made an appointment with a psychiatrist, that's a great step!\n\nPersonally some things I used to do in the same scenario:\n-acknowledge the feeling \n-self care\n-spend time with other people I care about, let them know I'm feeling anxious if I'm comfortable doing so\n-distraction\n\nYou're having a hard time so be kind to yourself! It's a great time to have a warm bath or wrap up in a comfy blanket and pyjamas and watch a movie you love.\n\nMy therapist has me trying \"name and tame\", basically giving what you're feeling a label. It makes you pause and provides a bit of space from the feeling. Grounding techniques are really helpful for me as well. Anxiety is often very much about what will happen in the future or (for me at least) what could have gone differently in the past so anything to help ground you in the present can really help.\n\nSorry if nothing there was really helpful! Long story short, you will get through this and you will be ok. I believe in you, you're taking all the right steps in setting up an appointment and reaching out for help.",

It can be quite debilitating, it stops me from enjoying things I normally love. \n\nFor me, the worst thing is thinking about how long it will be until he comes back. Even if it's only a few hours, it can feel like ages and ages. So what I'll do is prepare plans and lists of all the things I can do in the meantime, preferably as time-consuming as possible (cleaning, studying, working out, video games, baking, Lego - whatever). I have a sticky note by my desk with an emergency plan of things to do by myself if I feel like the time just isn't passing. Maybe there's something you don't often do when he's around? I know it feels impossible but the goal is to think about anything other than the fact that he's away for as much time as possible. \n\nAnother thing that helps me is thinking about nice things I can do for him in the meantime, it makes me feel connected to him even when he's away. Not necessarily anything big, just things like preparing some food or getting his favourite chocolate from the shop. You could get him a little welcome home present, write him a card, bake him a cake, whatever makes sense to you.\n\nDon't be hard on yourself. Keep busy, spend time with people you love, and remind yourself that he will eventually be back and you will be okay.",

There is no trauma in her past in any way, it's just who she is, and the more I think about it, the more I realise she's felt these things always.\n\nWhat I'm looking for is the best ways to help her. My husband and I are seeing a therapist who guides us as well, but I'm wondering if people here might have something so say as well? Surely you know a thing or two about what would be helpful to you.\n\nAt the moment she extremely afraid to be alone and scared of the dark. Also she's terrified of the prospect of pain in any way - when she wears a band-aid she won't allow us to take it off, it has to come off by itself. It might sound like regular kid stuff, but it's severe panic in these situations. Uncertainty about the day-to-day also throws her off, but we have good ways of managing that. \n\nAnything is appreciated. It's extremely tough to navigate this.\n",

I used to be on antidepressants but the doctor took me off them because I always felt nauseous or felt vertigo eith Zoloft, vortioxetine etc. I received a considerable amount of talk therapy to get to where I am without medication. I do not do talk therapy anymore for financial reasons.\n\nWhen I\u2019m being successful and my life is going okay, I always start to panic and self sabotage. I get depressed, I get brain fog, I start turning everything over in my head until I find a potential problem. Then I let that problem ruin my happiness for months.\n\n For example: Got into an amazing relationship, started panicking if my bf is still in love with his ex (this has been talked about so much and he is NOT), obsessing over the ex.\n\n I finally got rid of that and now everything is going okay - I got into med school, my relationship has been going strong for 2 years, my relationship with my turbulent family is fine, I found some new amazing friends, I have two jobs, etc. \n\nToday starts a week where I really need to study and focus on myself for my finals. I cannot get myself to concentrate, I would rather just self isolate in bed, eat junk etc. Even though I WANT to study, exercise, clean up. I\u2019m panicking in bed. About the future, about the past, ruminating over everything and trying to find problems that would ruin things for me.\n\nHas anyone been through this or has any advice?\n",

However I did not take real breaks in the last 4 years as I was an international student then started working immediately so I can afford to live. Now I feel like I can no longer handle the situation and my job became real bad in the last couple weeks because of lack of motivation and concentration and more. I have an appointment to see a doctor so I can go on mental health leave of absence but it feels so bad to be doing that as I\u2019m feeling guilty and thinking about the reaction of my boss and colleagues but at the same time I think they will understand and support the idea because they definitely noticed my struggles since I was hired. I know it is my right to do that but I feel bad as I\u2019m putting myself in this situation. I work for a multinational company and they will be paying 100% of my salary for the period which is good. \n\nDid anyone go through this experience before? When I\u2019m taking action now I started to question my feelings as if they are valid or not. ",

Ever since I started college, my body has developed some sort of anxiety about school. Whenever I\u2019m enrolled, I wake up EVERYDAY with instant anxiety and panic to the point where I throw up (stomach acid and water) and shake in bed, EVERYDAY. The anxiety last up until about mid-day and then things sort of calm down after. I feel like school does this to me because I\u2019ve never been a great student (hence why i\u2019m 25 still trying to pursue a 4 year degree). I feel behind in life and not too proud to be in college still at this point of my life. I feel like I\u2019ve waisted precious time (my twenties) on trying to correct various screw ups i\u2019ve made. Overall, I\u2019m looking to improve my anxiety and panic and have no clue where to start? I\u2019ve somewhat tried meditation and  working out but i\u2019m too afraid to get on medication. Any help?

It normally works well enough to help me get through the day :)\n\nI understand how you feel, it's really exhausting.

        "body": "I was on medication from 6th grade until junior year of high school, took a few years off meds were I was abusing pm every illicit drug you can probably think besides heroin and pcp including fent. I'm clean from everything besides weed nowadays, had a relapse on fent last June. Anyways I've been unemployed for 14 months besides a job I had in October of 23 that I got fired from in like 5 days. I've had extreme anxiety about job interviews, I apply to jobs schedule an interview then end up paralyzed by anxiety the day of and don't end up going to said interviews. I'm back on meds now. It's been a month since I started wellbutrin buspar propranolol and gabapentin. Gabapentin is only for sleep. About 2.5 weeks of Caplyta so far. I'm not feeling much relief from the anxiety, I'm less suicidal for sure but I still can't seem to force myself to really look for a job. Idk what the point of all this medication is when I'm still stuck at home 95% of the time with no money and only Netflix and YouTube for entertainment. I'm feeling pretty hopeless today, tbh most days still. The lack of results are making me want to relapse, specifically on benzos. It's been almost 2 years since I've taken a benzo and I keep thinking to myself that if I can be prescribed them ill be able to get my life in order. I don't think my doc will prescribe them, he's not a psychiatrist just like my general physician. I obviously don't want to go back to buying them off the street bc of the dangerous cuts and RC benzos. I don't know what my options are. The idea of trying to explain this gap in my work history just makes me even more nervous for a job interview. It's just gotten worse and worse with time. What the hell do I do?\n\nPS I haven't had good results from ssris at all in the past. I've been on zoloft lexapro pristiq and Prozac over the years.",

                "body": "Idk Maybe talk to a psychiatrist and build up a trust with them so that if you really need a controlled substance maybe they will get to a comfort level as far as prescribing it. I think the farther you get away from the illicit drug use the better things will be. It\u2019s not easy though because the abuse takes away your dopamine receptors which causes problems until they get healthy again. So hang in there. Not sure how much gabapentin you take and if increasing it is an option, but it has helped me with anxiety.",

        "body": "I have a question and that is why is there so many people who have an anxiety disorder related to their personal health  post on here and other sites that because of their health anxiety they see a doctor multiple times a month/months even years and they\u2019re  deemed as perfectly healthy and none of their tests ever come back positive for something medically serious like cancer or some sort of disease. That they come on here and talk about how they see these doctors and even after all those tests coming back negative time and time again they still worry that something\u2019s wrong with them.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to be mean here or rude as I understand just how awful anxiety can be and how it can become extremely exhausting and mentally draining when it comes to constantly worrying about developing something serious or thinking that you may already have something and no doctor just  hasn\u2019t  been able to catch it. \n\nI genuinely think it\u2019s interesting that this happens. And I personally have had times in my life where I\u2019ve seen a doctor and was nervous that they may have missed something crucial and that they could\u2019ve been wrong about whatever they diagnosed me with.\n\nSo I\u2019m curious as to hear about why this happens to others? And what triggered it.",

I lost a family member last year that seemed to later trigger a myriad of mental and physical symptoms, that have never really gone away. Also there can be a misdiagnosis or mistrust of doctors due to past experiences. Or, much like other types of anxiety, there may not be a single trigger or explanation. The fact is, health is important, maybe the most important thing we have if we want to live well. So it makes sense that we develop sensitivity towards it. It\u2019s not nice being uncertain and afraid of what\u2019s going on with our own bodies.",

Previous to that, I struggled with regular anxiety, going place, seeing people, etc. After I got sick, I was in and out of the hospital for years, and even still to this day for procedures and all that jazz. I have to get blood and urine samples every 3 months (I hate needles). There's a lot of monitoring involved. It also changed my life drastically. I became incredibly intune with my body. I can feel and notice every little thing. So, sure enough, my anxiety developed into something else entirely. It believes that, eventually, what I have, which isn't life threatening, will be some day. Like the doctors have missed something. I have a lot of thoughts like \"I should be better by now. How do I still feel this way?\" What am I doing wrong? Is it a rare thing they haven't tested for yet?\". It's exhausting...",

I started slow with just one thing at a time and it took a long time but now I'm in a much better space. I'm not saying these things can magically make your issues disappear but it does help in coping with it.

Basically unapproachable to the point where social interactions means nothing to me for the most part.\n\nI started taking care of myself more. Skin routine. Hair Conditioner. Face wash. Lotion. Watching what I eat(CICO&OMAD) and trying to get rid of stressors as well as being aware of negative thought patterns. I feel proud of myself. Not fully. But definitely more than previously.\n\nI had a million reasons to feel sorry for myself and potentially I still have these reasons. I'm only human. Old habits die hard. At this point I'm not chasing an end-goal. I'm living as minimally as possible. I understand that might sound like a cop out to some. But all the pressure of wanting to \"be something\" was what was derailing my life. I wanted to start over and that means stripping myself off all my preconceived notions of what life is meant to be. This looks different to everyone. For me was giving up and giving in. Accepting myself for what I am and moving forward with that knowledge.\n\nSorry for the ramble, just felt inclined to chime in. I hope we all prosper one day and find success in whichever way success means to us individually."

Luckily for me there's a way out through medication.

Try to eat right and exercise as much as you can. Right now you are low on critical neurotransmitters and you need diet, exercise, and the 'great' outdoors to boost them. I don't like the idea of light therapy and it's effect on the retina, but you may want to get a reptile heat lamp and shine it on your stomach for 2-3 minutes per day. That will get your vitamin D up if you don't want to supplement. Try a low dose of B-complex 25-50 mg/day, flaxseed oil, vitamin C, magnesium, niacinamide 500 mg. It sounds like you may be more depressed than anxious. You need to get your brain chemicals up and running again. Try natural BEFORE artificial shit like ssri's.",

                "body": "I used to- I went on a self realization journey and realized a lot of my anxiety and depression was due to my view of the world, it was very negative. I realized that this wasn\u2019t normal and sought for change, I began surrounding myself with positive mentors (Tony Robbins, Trish Blackwell, Mel Robbins, Jordan Peterson \u00a0and others) through podcasts and on social media platforms where I follow their channels. I was able to tap into positivity and a completely positive mindset and the anxiety melted. I also realized that many times I suppressed who I was and my truth to appease others- so basically living a lie in this negative mindset.\u00a0\n\nIt sounds really crazy, but since I have achieved this positive mindset, I do have moments of frustration- but I have settled my anxiety finally and live in such a different world now. I see abundance and positivity- and I work to share with the world through all interactions, kindness, and absolute love. Also I practice gratefulness and stopped looking at everything half empty.\n\nYou can start right now, it lieerally changes the bueno pathways in your brain Bs taking meds. Right now think of one thing you are grateful for. Tomorrow think of two\u2026 then keep going, keep cheering yourself for all small wins\u2026 keep going- you will see the world for its beauty and settle this anxiety- because once you are in that place, nothing can bother you.\u00a0\n\nStay true to yourself- that doesn\u2019t mean being rude or mean, it just means if someone asks you to do something you don\u2019t want to do, you just simply do, I\u2019m good - but I\u2019d love to do this, this or this\u2026 \u00a0stay kind, I hope you find your peace. I seriously have achieved it and you can too- it\u2019s not easy, but I am living proof that it can happen so I know if I can do it, anyone can.",

        "body": "So I've been having anxiety and panic attacks for about 8 years now.. I've gotten really good at getting my panic attacks under control quick and I've gotten so much better at anxiety in general. Especially in public. I think \"I may feel uncomfortable, but if anything actually happens, there are so many people here who can help\"\n\nI'm currently in a relationship where we live apart and that will always be the case... The biggest hurdle in my anxiety life right now is living alone and dealing with the \"what-ifs\" of health anxiety. It's gotten to the point of considering ending the relationship so I can be in one where I'd live with my partner.\n\n(side note: I just took a 7 minute break while typing this to have a panic attack. I called my mom during that panic attack (in case I, idk, died or something) and she was like \"dad's at work right now and I'm home by myself for the next X amount of hours so a different relationship doesn't help that\")\n\nHow do you all work through the monophobia and the health anxiety symptoms of living alone? I usually don't have a problem, but occasionally I'll start to notice different physical symptoms and begin to freak out.",

Sometimes when I'm ruminating over something I turn to the internet like \"how do I get over perfectionism\" it's always always always the same answers I don't know why I look anymore. I do all those things, I exercise, I go to therapy, I practice mindfulness, I try to limit my caffeine, I take medication etc. I feel vastly better than I have in the past but I still have some really hard days and I am hard on myself. I do all the things but is this the best it can get for me? Overall I guess I'm better but in the middle of an Anxiety spike or a panic attack or when I'm going over and over something stupid that I said or did (that logically is never that big of a deal) it just feels permanent. I know logically it will pass but those moments are so intense and awful until it does. \n\nAnyway bit of a rant. ",

It feels like a band of pressure running from behind my nose/forehead, to the base of my skull where it meets my neck. It's triggering my anxiety because this feeling is making me almost feel a bit lightheaded. I went to the doctor, they did a CBC and everything was fine. My blood pressure is also fine so I don't think that's causing it. Could it be this is all from anxiety. The obvious answer I feel is probably sinuses but I don't feel congested with a stuffy/runny nose. I just have a lot of pressure. ",

Lately, I get worried for the smallest events. For example, I told someone at my work something personal, and I was up all night worrying that she was going to tell everybody in the building. I tell myself that I have a certain time frame to worry until I can stop. As soon as I stop worrying about one thing, something else takes its place. I am scared that this amount of anxiety will negatively affect my personal relationships in the long run. ",

It can jump from 50 to 150, then back down, \"in a heartbeat\" (he smiled at his pun). \n\nThis is the design of the heart that functions correctly. Some people come to me, and they believe that their heart should act like a watch, clicking along at the exact same rate, all the time. Honeatly, if it did that.... you'd die.\" \n\n\nSo, take that from my caridologist. Your heart *should* fluctuate all the time, changing to meet the changing demands of your body.",

        "body": "I've been dating my girlfriend for a little over a year and she has had anxiety her whole life, abusive relationships, not a great childhood.\nHer anxiety has slowly gotten worse, she can't almost ever leave the house, it's almost impossible for her to visit as she is scared of my parents disliking her, she has panic attacks, small things can ruin her day. She's not suicidal but doesn't want to exist.\nShe won't try medication as she's terrified of how one effected her years ago.\nIdk what to do to help her, if she can't help herself, is a mental hospital my only choice? I have no experience with this /: I've read they can run a lot of tests for mental health disorders and such, but I have no idea.\n\nShe has been on several waiting lists for a psychiatrist for over a year now, she lives in CT state insurance, none have been available \n\nShe also started having full body pain last June and no Dr has helped, just saying it's her anxiety and that it's \"bc your not in fight or flight anymore\" then said she has fibromyalgia after only a clean blood test.\n\nShe does leave for food with me or the movies, but it's always a little hard, any big things are overwhelming for her.  I love her and I'm happy with her and she treats me well, but want her to get better for herself and our future too\nAny recommendations would be appreciated!!",

Finally she was prescribed an anti-depressant which all her many doctors say will certainly help her, but she has not taken it (it has been months). She even told me she had started but I found the full packet. \nCan you call the waiting lists she is on and ask if they have had any cancellation? My wife\u2019s problem is that she will go and see a doctor and then come back saying s/he has got it wrong, didn\u2019t do the tests that she needed. She doesn\u2019t do any exercise or even read books (she is a retired teacher with a PhD). \nI really wish there was something I could say that would help, but I know it won\u2019t. All I know is that she won\u2019t get better by herself, and we can\u2019t help, we are simply not qualified beyond love and affection. Strength to you.",

Now, I can even take some medications while I'm alone (if I know they're safe).

They are either a danger to themselves or others. I could be completely wrong tho. \n\nTry to unmask what triggering the anxiety. Is it social situations, is it health anxiety, is it general anxiety about everything. \n\nThen slowly introduce the thing that is triggering the anxiety so that she gets used to it. For instance if someone is anxious about going grocery shopping, the only way to cure it is by getting used to the process of grocery shopping.\n\nIts sucks and is uncomfortable, but it works. Reminder her that anxiety isnt dangerous just uncomfortable and that she can make it through.",

                "body": "As someone who had a traumatic childhood, the first thing that I can remember that began to heal me was music. Not surprisingly, I make music today in the hopes that it can give someone else the strength and motivation to change.  \nThere are several songs around anxiety, traumas, and depression, that we've made. As artists, it's cathartic for us, but more importantly, it's for the people listening.   \nThat one song can help validate a person and what they've been through. So I'm going to include a track at the bottom that might resonate with your partner. (Let me know!)\n\n  \nBeyond being moved by music, your partner should try Teledoc Therapy, where she can begin to unravel and address the past traumas right from the comfort of her own home. Also, exposure therapy, bit by bit, is clinically effective at mitigating some, if not all of the anxiety around the fear/phobia depending on the context.  \n\n\nThe fear of medication is not irrational if she has had a bad experience in the past with something. What I CAN tell you is that most people who struggle with Major Depressive Disorder/Generalized Anxiety/etc. have to try a few different SSRIs or even SNRIs, as well as adjunct medications, before they find an optimal regimen that is harmonious with their individual body chemistry. Unfortunately, it is trial and error. But it IS worth it when you find a pharmaceutical regimen that changes your life.   \n\n\nMy final recommendation is to make sure you research available therapists - specifically their specialties. Find someone who specializes in trauma and PTSD, as these will be the people who can help the most.   \n\n\nAlso, a couple's therapist can help flesh out things like your individual communication styles, and how to optimize that communication, especially when one or both partners are having a tough time. This can also be accessed through Teledoc or any other virtual therapy platform.  \n\n\nIt can be a long process, but it is worth it, of course! Just be there for her. Every step of the way. As it seems you have been. You're a good soul for coming on here and asking for advice!  \n\n\n[Grateful by The Vanishing Point](https://soundcloud.com/user-326384011/grateful?si=d48ab56af4064460865130aae7720350&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing)",

I hate that I see in the comments \u201cleave her\u201d because mental health/ anxiety is not something you ask for, it just happens and it can be hard to get over. Now if she\u2019s saying she wants to kill herself and she is actively trying to do so then that\u2019s a whole different situation/scenario. That\u2019s the only time that a psych ward may need to be involved. But if she can\u2019t leave home and doesn\u2019t actively try to do that, that\u2019s really not a good idea. Psych wards in my experience are very hard places, they can leave you worse than where you started. They are just like they are depicted in movies in most situations. I dealt with some of the most rude workers I\u2019ve ever met there. So yeah I\u2019d say go the therapy, self help route at first. It may even open her up to trying other things in the future or maybe that\u2019ll be all she needs.",

                "body": "as someone who also has severe anxiety and has been inpatient in psych wards/mental hospitals, i would not recommend it unless her life is in immediate danger. they are not warm or healing places, it\u2019s honestly like a jail and can be extremely traumatizing. they just keep you alive until you\u2019re stable enough for therapy and that\u2019s it. they can be very abusive. many people are left worse than when they went in. it would break her trust and not do anything to heal her \n\nan intensive outpatient group might be a good option, if you\u2019re able to afford one. . they are groups that do a few hours of therapy a day and will target the anxiety. it sounds like regular therapy isn\u2019t enough so this might be a better option \n\ni\u2019m in a different state but at least here, there are lots of places that offer sliding scare payment, aid, or discounts, as well as places for low income people. it is worth looking into if a regular psychiatrist is too expensive \n\nsomatic therapy might be good for her as well. something like edmr if her anxiety is rooted in trauma. it helped me a lot. exposure therapy targeted at agoraphobia might help too. i don\u2019t know what therapy she\u2019s in now, but cbt is the most common and that doesn\u2019t work for everyone, especially those with trauma \n\nhonestly i don\u2019t blame her for not doing medication. i\u2019ve been on 15+ and they all left me worse than before. honestly they permanently messed up by nervous system, they don\u2019t work for everyone. if she doesn\u2019t want to try that, maybe something like magnesium could help a bit. and if not ssris, beta blockers are an option that help with the physical symptoms of anxiety. no risk for seratonin syndrome i think",

Maybe try talking her into just seeing someone and getting a professional opinion about her worries with being on medication that way everything\u2019s not set in stone. you can even see a doctor over telehealth so that she doesnt have to go anywhere. Just remind her that this is something that can make her life a whole lot easier and it\u2019s worth the chance. If shes worried about having to take something everyday propranolol is a great option for panic attacks as its non-habit forming medication, it definitely helps me.",

OCD is almost ALWAYS misdiagnosed and it can be extremely severe and debilitating.  Very few therapists actually recognize it or know how to treat it.  So that\u2019s why people with ocd don\u2019t get better with traditional therapy.    \n\nOCD is an extreme expression of anxiety and It has MANY forms and agoraphobia is common with OCD when left untreated because it\u2019s so overwhelming.  She may or may not be doing things (washing hands). But she may be thinking things over and over in a way that is OCD.  OCD is pure suffering and I feel so bad for your girlfriend.   Thank you for trying to help her.   \n\nThe Institute of Living in Hartford. has an Anxiety Center.  They are amazing there.  Very well versed in all anxiety disorders as well as OCD therapy.    If not there:  ask for referrals for qualified practitioners.  \n\nAlso I have a great cbt/ocd therapist but she is in Avon\u2026 she only does in person.  Let me know if you would travel there. \n\nPs.   I also get serotonin syndrome from ssris and snris.   It\u2019s frustrating because I\u2019ve tried 5. And they all made my anxiety sooo much worse.   -I did the genetic testing too- never again for me either.  Meds are not a solution for everyone. \n\nMental hospitals are great for acute problems. Safety and getting on medication fast:  I don\u2019t think it would help her at this time.   But she needs help, within the next week or so because she is indeed suffering.  \n\nMessage me if you have any questions.   Happy to help.",

No way to know for now /:\nShe says she needs a break from Drs right now, even though we have only gone to the one aprn every 3 months checkup.  We want to try a rheumatologist just to cross things off as she has family history of arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis I think.

        "body": "Hi, i want to ask something about my symptoms. I usually have like a lot of stress from things that someone would not care about. I suffer from anxiety too. I do not really understand things like this, but i was checked by my doctor and i am really healthy, he found nothing. After sleep i feel like nothing is real, dizziness, blurry vision, slowed reactions and nothing can help me only when it's night then i am feeling better. Sometimes it's weaker, sometimes it's stronger and sometimes i thing that my head is going to explode. I used to have a lot of hobbies that was fun before, now it's like thing to do when i have really nothing to do, I am not that happy from it as it was before at all. I tried a lot of things to counter it somehow, what helped me most was to distract from it somehow like being in school on not stressful day or being with friends and i can't forget about this : around 5hours of sleep and caffeine is like best because i am only sleepy and my symptoms are really weak. I do have a problem to fall a sleep, i found something about it and i think that it's called palpitation or something like that, when i finally going to sleep, i thing about something stressful from the day and i get that weird feeling and my heart starts beating faster or slower, it's really uncomfortable when i am really sleepy and when it happens like 3 times in a row. I have it for 2 months or more, but before it was ok, but now it's unbearable. Like 2years ago i was feeling great, everything was fun i was full of life, then i lost a lot of weight, got more necessary things to do (stressed daily) and it got into this stage. I really don't know what to do, my family doesn't help me at all and it's getting worse day by the day, but i am trying to fix it but it's not working. Can someone please give me some advice what should i do and what causes all of my problems (specific name of that illness or physical condition) ? Sorry for my english, it's not my main language.",

I freak out a bit then it subsides and I realize it was just sinus pressure (definitely sinus pressure not a migraine or anything, i can literally feel it in my sinuses). And that pressure turns into a headache then a tylenol or ibuprofen later and i'm back to normal.   \n\n\nI've been noticing this more recently with the weather changing as often as it has been being warm for two days, then cold again and then windy, then back to springlike again. I've dealt with sinus headaches most of my life with allergies in the summer and colds in the winter, but now it seems like that's where my anxiety is mostly tied to anymore. I'm fine otherwise. ",

Like I said, they were every now and then but never constantly and never interfering with my day to day life. This past January 2nd, I had a massive panic attack in my shower that seemed to be out of no where, but I will say that the time I was going through a bit of relationship issues. But the panic attack was unlike any other I\u2019ve had before. I thought I was going to puke/pass out/ and die all at the same time, and I couldn\u2019t breathe. Messed me up for the rest of the day, and since Jan 2nd, I\u2019ve been having these type of panic attacks almost daily. It triggered something in me, maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m so afraid of passing out from one? But long story short, it\u2019s now march and I\u2019m on my first dose of Prozac to help combat the daily/multiple anxiety attacks. I can\u2019t leave my house, and I wonder why I freaked out the way I did that day, and why it messed me up so bad to the point I\u2019ve had to try to rebuild my life in 2 months. \n\nTLDR; did you have an experience or situation that started your anxiety and you\u2019ve struggled since?

Health anxiety is seriously no joke, it\u2019s destroyed a lot of things in my life. You can manifest symptoms and give yourself panic attacks. I really do push that you talk to someone, whether a doctor or therapist, or a friend. Medication may not be the route for everyone but I\u2019ve heard stories of peoples lives being changed for the better after it. And therapy is a good place to express your fears without being judged. I really wish the best on your healing journey, because you deserve to be happy!!"

I don't give a shit what your doctor says, most of the general practitioners have no clue how to manage psych meds. They just hand them out as a wait and see method to the patients. Raise it REALLY slow. Make notes daily about your anxiety level. It may be that you have to go through several weeks of side effects before that hopefully wears off. If it doesn't, stop the drug, taper off it and try a more sedating one. Try to help yourself naturally as much as possible.",

I know how frustrating it can be to find the right meds. Every time it felt like I was making headway we would hit a roadblock. Please do not give up. It sucks, but you are not alone. As for the sleep, has it always been an issue? I just wonder because I also had sleep issues and it turned out I had sleep apnea. If it had not been for my neurologist I would have not had my genesight test or sent to a pulmonary doctor for a sleep test which is how I got my sleep apnea diagnosis. It wouldn't hurt to look into those. I wish you the best.",

        "body": "Hey All,\n\nAs someone who gets frequent and severe anxiety attacks, I'm always looking for the types of games that are calming, with freedom to play the game how you want, few time limits, lots of exploration, and a relaxing pace.  So I've compiled a list of some of the games I think are most relaxing.\n\nThese aren't all strictly cozy games, but all sorts of different types.  Also worth noting that although this is a PC game list, you can find many of these on multiple platforms.  I realize that this list isn't for everybody, and not everyone is a gamer, but I'm hoping this post might help some people who might be in the same boat.\n\n**American Truck Simulator** - There are few things more relaxing than being on the open road.  And sure there is some skill involved and some time limits, but for the most part it's a very relaxing game and great at calming the nerves.\n\n**Balatro** - This game uses the rules of poker, but adds deckbuilder elements to it and some really interesting twists.  It's really easy to get started, and very easy to get addicted to.\n\n**Bear & Breakfast** - This is normally not my type of game, but I've been playing this one recently and I am surprised at how much I've been enjoying it.  It's smartly written, well drawn, and very relaxing to play, yet there's plenty of depth to it, and plenty to do.\n\n**Broken Reality** - This one you might not have heard of, but it's a game set in a vaporwave world that's deeply satisfying and has a great vibe and a great soundtrack.  Exploration is not only encouraged, it's probably the most important element, and there are plenty of puzzles to solve along the way.\n\n**The Coin Game** - If you like the types of arcade games where you try to win tickets, this is your game.  It's a simulator with plenty of different arcades to explore and even a survival mode where you try to win tickets to survive.  It has a surprising amount of depth, and is a lot of fun to play.\n\n**Dave The Diver** - Dave The Diver is a fantastic mix of a restaurant simulation and a diving simulation, with lots of other elements and surprises along the way.  This one is relaxing but a lot of fun, and there's really something in it for everyone to enjoy.\n\n**Donut County** - Very underappreciated game from Annapurna Interactive which is clever, funny, and oddly satisfying to play.  For each level you summon a hole in the ground that gets bigger with every item the hole absorbs.  The characters and story are great and very funny, and while it's a short game, it's a light hearted one that's really easy to enjoy.\n\n**Escape Simulator** - If you like escape rooms, this is the best escape room game out there.  There is tons of community content for this game as well, so you will never run out of new puzzles to solve.\n\n**Hypnagogia** - This game is a relatively unknown one, which is a damn shame because it's a fantastic game.  It has a lot of elements of early 2000's Playstation adventure games, but big vaporwave type vibes.  Lots of puzzles to solve, interesting characters, and unique worlds.  Definitely recommend picking this one up.\n\n**LSD Dream Simulator** - This is a classic Playstation game that doesn't really have an objective (or the objective is a very abstract one).  It's very weird, and absolutely has its unique vibe.  If you're on PC, search for LSD Revamped - it's a community revived version of LSD that is completely free.\n\n**Palworld** - What can be said about this game that hasn't already been said?  It's inexpensive, well thought out, and there are multiple ways to play it and go at your own pace.  A lot of fun with a lot of potential for future updates as well.\n\n**Paradise Killer** - Another vaporwave type game that has a really interesting world, and a great soundtrack.  Here you try to find clues and talk to people to solve a murder - it's very well thought out with hours and hours of gameplay.\n\n**PC Building Simulator** - If you enjoy putting together and taking apart PC's, this one's incredibly relaxing and satisfying.\n\n**Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney** - Another classic with a very different objective than most games.  You play as a defense attorney, and try to prove your clients innocent.  Always a lot of fun.\n\n**Pinball FX** - I find pinball to be really relaxing, and this is a very realistic simulation.  You can get some pinball tables for free or very cheap during sales (and humble bundles occasionally), and there are regularly tables that you can try a demo of as well.\n\n**Project Highrise** - If you ever played Sim Tower in the 90's, this is the modern day equivalent.  You build and manage a tower, attract tenants, and expand your tower over time.\n\n**Road 96** - This one took me by surprise.  While it is a politically themed game (which for some people is the opposite of relaxing), there are all sorts of different adventures, characters you meet and learn about along the way, and a solid soundtrack as well.  It's got a lot of heart, and is definitely worth playing.\n\n**Slime Rancher** - This has probably been covered by a lot of people, but it's a very relaxed, slow paced game where you look for and round up slimes.  There's lots to do, and it's incredibly relaxing.\n\n**Tabletop Simulator** - A sandbox type game for just about any board game you can think of.  Lots to do in this game, and there's something for everyone.\n\n**Teardown** - What a fun, satisfying game this is with loads of community content for it.  This is a sandbox style game where your goal is to tear down and destroy buildings and structures.  There are tons of worlds out there, and all sorts of tools you can use to destroy things.  This one can be incredibly therapeutic.\n\n**Tetris Effect** - If you haven't played this one and you enjoy Tetris, get it.  The soundtrack and gameplay style is absolutely superb, and while there are intense high skilled game modes, there's also plenty of relaxing ones too where you can go at your own pace.  There have been studies on Tetris, anxiety and PTSD, and all of the positive effects it has.\n\n**Ticket To Ride** - This is the video game version of the board game, and it's incredibly relaxing and satisfying if you've never played it before.",

I would recommend Life is Strange, and Before the storm, in my experience I found it relaxing as I immersed in the plot, and the music is beautiful and calm, so it helped me to get off of my head during the time I was playing it. Although I think it's important to do a little research about the story prior, some might find it shocking as it involves some serious themes, which I will not mention in order to not spoil it.",

        "body": "I've developed a fear of drinking, eating, and touching things in case they have been drugged. This has been going on for months and over this last month it's gotten bad. I've only been eating once a day and I'm scared to touch anything unknown. I'm dehydrated and I've been feeling fatigued, unable to concentrate, and sick. I can't bring myself to even touch a water bottle, I can't eat out, I can't cook food for myself, I can't eat what anyone but my mom cooks, i can't drink water, i can't touch anything unknown. The biggest problem I have with this is the panic attacks that come after i do any of those things. The panic attacks just fuel the fear that something has been drugged bc it feels like I'm having a bad trip. It's so difficult to hang out with people and do basic things to keep myself alive. I can't enjoy anything when I'm so horrified of stuff being drugged.\n\nI feel terrible for not trusting the people around me, but I can't handle another panic attack. As of recently, I haven't been able to eat my mom's cooking. \n\nIt comes about at random and I feel so powerless. I can't hang out with friends or family without having a panic attack over something being drugged. Even though I understand it's unrealistic I still get panic attacks. I don't use the term panic attack lightly either. I'm crying, I can't breathe, it feels like I'm dying, I get dizzy, my chest hurts, I'm shaking. It's all around the worst thing I've experienced in my life.\n\nDoes anyone else have anything similar? Or any tips to make this stop? Or know what this could be?",

                "body": "Anxiety is a mechanism to protect ourselves. Its very handy but sometimes over react to things. Its like a friend who loves to micromanage. \n\nYou should be cautious about people drugging you drinks at a club. Thats actually common. But your anxiety has taken this unfortunately fact of life and generalized with everything. If your friend hands you a bag of chips, of course they are not drugging you, but Anxiety always comes up with a \u201cwhat if\u201d scenario \n\nWhat you have to do is ignore your anxious thinking. Straight up tell yourself \u201c Im being paranoid because im anxious\u201d then eat it. Take a leap of faith and i promise you nothing bad is gonna happen.\n\nYou have to trust yourself more than your trust your anxiety.",

It was THC but still drugging someone is poisoning them no matter what the substance is! \n\nMy point here is \u201cbecause of some asshole coworkers\u201d they had a reason and saw my reaction. Nobody is going to drug / lace random food I promise you as hard as it is to believe because of the OCD.\n\nI\u2019m living proof that after being drugged for real I am able to eat foods again and even takeout from restaurants! I still can\u2019t eat in restaurants because I feel trapped, but I\u2019m able to enjoy food at my own leisure at least. \n\nI take Xanax for my panic disorder so it can\u2019t get much stronger than that, and I\u2019m telling you no pill will fix this or make it go away. Exposure is unfortunately the only way and forcing yourself to eat things little by little. The pills don\u2019t fix this problem trust me, it\u2019s something you have to work on.",

It eased up the anxiety response so I could learn what it's supposed to feel like when something unexpected happens.

So severe I had to go to the ER to get something to calm me down. There they gave me an Ativan and prescribed be Hydroxyzine. I was told to stop the Fluoxetine. I slept from 11 pm Monday to about 2 PM Tuesday I'm sure because of the 2 medications making me exhausted plus the panic attack. I've been sleeping on and off since. This morning I felt okay enough to get up, shower, clean the car out, and then go with the family on a shopping trip.\n\nI've never ever experienced a panic attack. Is this overwhelming feeling of doom still normal?! Will I ever stop worrying about if I'm going to have another? I'm a mom of 2 who have crazy extracurriculars and I've got to get over this. I have therapy on Tuesday, and obviously will bring this up. I'm trying not to take hydroxyzine because it makes me feel so loopy and tired and I've gotta be able to drive. \n\nMy husband took the week off to take care of anything and everything but we all have to get back to normal life in 3 days and I'm terrified.

She's the love of my life, and I love the thought of raising a child with her, but I struggle with (and am medicated for) anxiety disorder, and have a huge amount of anxiety about our finances.\n\nI grew up around the 2008 financial crisis, raised by disabled parents that made barely enough to get by, so I grew up with constant feelings of guilt, like I was a financial burden to them, and I don't want to pass those feelings onto my child.\n\nWe make enough to get by, and we have a large net of supportive family members that have expressed that they are excited for us to have children, and are happy to support us however they can. Do you have any advice for worrying less about money, and how to go with the flow like my fianc\u00e9e and her family seem to?\n\n**TLDR:** How do I overcome anxiety about money before my fianc\u00e9e and I have a child?",

Mostly the catastrophising write ups, cuz i do the exact same thing. I overthink like crazy, but when ur looking at it from an outside perspective ur like \u201cwow this poor soul is going nuts cuz their hand was cold haha\u201d. So it makes me think maybe people who r on the outside of the scenario im catastrophising are thinking the same thing about me. Which makes me think \u201cmaybe im just loosing my mind for no reason and its actually not as bad as i think\u201d. Anxiety is so irrational, but it is comforting to know that there r other people out there dealing with the same thing. I wish we could all just laugh at our problems together.",

And if its happening to others, its probably the same for me when im freaking out. Trust me, anxiety sucks, its not fun or entertaining, its horrible, and it feels as tho its outside of ur control. But laughing at it takes away the seriousness of it. If i can laugh at myself while im having a panic attack it just proves to me my mind isnt broken. And if i can convince myself my mind isnt broken, and ill go back to normal eventually. It makes the experience less terrifying."

        "body": "Not looking for diagnosis. More so a vent and info request on known conditions that match anxiety of this scale since getting her to go to a doctor now is nearly impossible.\n\n89 year old female/my grandmother. I (grandson) and my mom (her daughter) have looked after her for over 30 years now. She was on the street before that, living in her car. This grandmother has been an absolutely anxious mess for pretty much all of my life and I'm 41 now. I've never seen anyone that anxious in my life. There are some considerable mental issues. I know that she's paranoid schizophrenic, for instance. She was diagnosed decades ago with that by some psychiatrist/psychologist or something. Has heard/talked to a 'man' for decades, says he plays music, sounds of people dying, musical instruments, says sexual stuff to her and such. Extremely dysfunctional life in every facet and constantly 'gave up' on everything from jobs that she kept short-term to just basic things. Somehow she raised 3 children, albeit in a very poor and dysfunctional way. She'd get a car from the car lot and instead of maintaining it, she'd \"give up\" on it and take it back and give it back to get another one, only to keep repeating in a useless pattern. She had an extremely unproductive life. By her 60's, she had 14 total work credits out of the 60 required to retire, so she ended up on SSI. Most people working full-time make about 4 credits per year, so after 10 years of actual working, she would have qualified for Social Security retirement. She didn't even work 10 legitimate jobs in 60+ years to get enough credits.\n\nFor years, she'll go flying out of bed every morning in a terrified fit to watch her very much adult daughter (now 66, but was 40's and 50's then) leave for work, as if watching a child leave for school to get the bus or something. Her daughter goes out 25 feet away and gets in her car and drives away. My grandmother will run from window to window and watch her for as far as she can up the road. Then she'll spend an hour or two pacing from room to room 'worrying' about her going to work and she works about 10 minutes away. During the pacing, about to shake herself to pieces in a panic for no reason, drinking Pepsi (so caffeine) at 6 or 7am, taking tobacco snuff (nicotine) frequently and then will go and pop open a beer and drink half of that (not good for her at her age). Then eat cereal and pace for a while and then go back to bed with 3 waking stimulants in her body, only to get up an hour or two later and pace the floor hundreds of times from end to end of the house looking out of all of the windows. Then take a nap during the day and get back up and pace a ridiculous amount of times again. She does this when it is getting light in the morning and also when it is getting dark in the afternoon. In the mornings, she's so 'anxious' for it to get light that she'll open curtains at sometimes 3 or 4am or an hour before light and want the light on. In the afternoons, it is common to find her wanting to turn the outside porch lights on up to an hour or more before it is dark because she's too 'anxious' for it to get dark.\n\nAmong her anxiety, exceptionally repetitive tasks. In between walking from room to room, she'll pick up an object from the bookcase in the dining room and walk into the living room about 20 feet away, then turn around and sit it back down and go back. Then come back into the dining room and pick it back up and take it back into the living room, only to take it back again shortly after. In pacing from room to room looking out each window rapid-fire, tearing off a paper towel each time to \"wipe off the window\" that was just wiped off (and wasn't even dirty to begin with) probably dozens of times. Constantly 'adjusting' the couch cover every time she goes by it in the living room, who knows how many hundreds of times per day she does that. Literally going from room to room, turning around and going back only to repeat.\n\nWhen grabbing an object from the shelf, she'll jerk and shake to the point where she'll be knocking other stuff off and then mock her own self audibly for it. She was seen by neurologists and such in the past and it didn't appear to be Parkinson's. It's her head and hands/arms that shake.\n\nShe gives the dog anxiety sometimes, walking back and forth anxiously giving treat after treat early in the morning. Standing in front of the tv for hours a day because she's too 'anxious' to see/hear what comes next on TV or something. Can't be still and sit down for long. Even when fixing food, she'll go sit down with a plate. Someone else will go into the kitchen to fix theirs and before she can take a couple of bites, she's already up walking back to the other room again to get back in there. It's mind numbing.\n\nWhen heading for the bathroom, she already has her hands on her pants ready to yank them down by the time she reaches the hallway. Too anxious to close and lock the bathroom door. While sitting on the toilet, she's literally too anxious to pee all the way, so she pees halfway and stops and then goes out only to come back literally a minute or two later because she didn't finish the first time. This results in an untold number of dozens of times per day where every time you start in the bathroom, kitchen, etc, she's \"there\" piddling around for no reason.\n\nWe try to be patient with her. Obviously, we've taken care of her for decades, so we do care about her. At the same time, her anxiety makes her mean as can be, among other things. She wants meds for it (benzos - something Xanax), but the docs don't want to give it to her. Of course, they want her to see a psychiatrist and naturally she doesn't think anything is wrong with her. At 89, she now has a-fib, of course. That causes anxiety on top of the anxiety that was already maxed. Everything is either hurry, hurry, hurry to her at the exact moment or she doesn't want to bother with something at all because of the \"give up\" impatient anxiety mindset.",

                        "body": "Unfortunately, the law is of no help to someone who is 'there' enough to deny help. She's able to appear normal enough when she wants to. She once called 911 from a store that we stopped at on my way to school when I was young. She told them that someone in the neighbor's attic said a bomb would go off in 15 minutes. Prompted a huge response, police, bomb squad, etc. My mother/her daughter came back home to that. Neighbor was at work. Fortunately they didn't kick his door down. Police wouldn't even force her to go for a mental evaluation after that. I have seen a lot of people in videos forcibly taken by police to go get a mental evaluation and after all of that they wouldn't even take her. Our hands are tied.\n\nShe has used the snuff/nicotine since age 7, oddly enough. Her mom started buying it for her after she was stealing it and taking it at that age. Caffeine for decades because she's addicted to it and alcohol is more recent over the past year. She claims it calms her nerves. Doctors referred her to psych to get the sedatives/meds for anxiety, but her refusal to go of course means they can't force her and neither can family. So she simply doesn't want to go.\n\nHowever, she frequently says she's \"so nervous\" all of the time. Doesn't even talk about any delusions openly, because they're of course real to her. She doesn't associate them with the anxiety. Took her to an elder law attorney last year. She sat there for 45 minutes, wouldn't even talk to him about her daughter doing everything for her and her denying her inability to do things for herself. He couldn't even get a logical answer out of her that made sense. He stated that the best we could do is try to go to court and convince the court that she needed someone to make her decisions for her.\n\nWhatever psych doc she saw decades ago (her daughter/my mother told me about it) diagnosed her with the paranoid schizophrenia, but also noted that she had high anxiety on top of it as a separate thing in and of itself. It's absolutely bizarre. She can be sitting on the couch watching tv and any little common event like the phone ringing or something will send her into an anxious fit. Or trying to perform a simple task...she'll get so 'anxious' to do it that she'll make her own self nervous and then get frustrated with herself. Every little task is done with anxiety. I've never heard of someone so anxious that they can't pee before. She has done that at doctor's offices...she'd drink water ahead of time and get there and tell them that she couldn't go and was essentially too 'anxious' to pee. At home, some days she turns the bathroom sink on to hear the water running because she somehow thinks that will help her do so."

So I had symptoms on the plane and most of the time while I was on vacation until I got antibiotics and finally felt better. But now unless I'm home alone and know I can be comfortable and go to the toilet whenever I want, I start to feel UTI symptoms (discomfort, urge to pee). Like if I have to go in the car for a while, if people come over to my house, being stuck at a place outside of home etc I start feeling anxious and getting the UTI symptoms. It's like being stuck on a plane and vacation while having a UTI low key traumatized me and now I anticipate feeling that way again and then my mind makes me think it's happening. I don't know what to do about this. I'm currently out at my mum's house 2 hoursaway from where I live and meant to be going out to dinner soon but I just want to leave immediately and go home, although dreading the trip back too. This is kinda ruining my life. I know it's in my head but I still can't overcome it. Anyone else have this, and managed to overcome it? ",

Just because it only happens in certain circumstances, like I can go days without it happening so I know it was psychological. If it happened for days on end or more often I'd go but I figured my GP wouldn't be able to do much for it. I was just hoping it would go away, but if it continues I'll probably go to my GP anyway just to see if there's anything that can be done.

I have interstitial cystitis, also known as painful bladder syndrome, and it gets much worse when I'm anxious due to producing more stomach acid. It's worth a shot! If that doesn't work, maybe try to experiment and when it happens, take an AZO urinary pain relief tablet. If it helps, then it is an actual irritation of the urinary tact but it nit then it is most likely stress related, and you may need to get a referral to a urologist of pelvic floor physiotherapist.",

I've been taking hiprex though which is meant to preventand treat  UTIs and it doesn't seem to make a difference, the only difference. But yeah good idea to try something first to check if there could be actual irritation. I've heard of interstitial cystitis, sorry you have to deal with that! Not sure if this is relevant but I did worry I did some permanent damage last year when I also had a self swab to do and I accidentally inserted it into my urethra \ud83d\ude2c but within a week the irritation from that was gone so I figured surely that wouldn't have done long term damage."

I'm petrified about the harm being done to the planet. \n\nLogically, I know there's a ton of good things happening in terms of renewable energy, conservation, etc. It just feels like things aren't moving quick enough to slow the damage. We hardly had any snow this year where I live. It's unnerving. I'm terrified that species will go extinct and things are going to start collapsing. \n\nI follow tons of accounts on instagram that share just good news on climate. I follow a ton of eco-friendly and sustainable accounts. I try to be sustainable in my own life. I pick up trash when I'm walking. I try to unplug from my phone and avoid the news because it just ramps up my anxiety.\n\nGoing out in nature just makes me think about nature and how we're killing the planet. I feel guilty when I drive or ride in a car, even though that's really my only option around here. I'm finding it difficult to turn my brain off, so to speak. \n\nI don't know what to do. Please help. Does anyone else experience this?",

Anywhere between 3 - 14 or times a year since the time was 13 or so I\u2019ve had recurring dreams about someone trying to stab me, me fighting for my life, and ultimately having to stab them back (many times with their own weapon) to save myself. The thing about these stabbing dreams is that it\u2019s never been a knife - it\u2019s always something unconventional like a pair or scissors, a screwdriver, a box cutter, that kind of thing. It\u2019s odd, and I\u2019ve always assumed it\u2019s related to my anxiety; the odd objects involved really peak my curiosity though.\n\nAnyone have any insight? Or even just input/ideas.\n\nI don\u2019t know if this is even related either but my longest recurring nightmare (really, I\u2019ve been having these since I was 6 or so at minimum) is related to being stuck somewhere and knowing bad people are coming to get me or hurt me but knowing there is nothing I can do, so I just sit and wait feeling an intense feeling of dread I can\u2019t even describe.\n\nAgain, I feel like these all are potentially just all caused by anxiety, but I\u2019d love to hear any interpretations or ideas anyone may have about why I\u2019ve had these my entire life; what kind of emotional, mental, spiritual reasons/etc. could be a factor?

I think that actually works, something about the heart being on the left. I could be trippin though.",

Was night and day difference for sleep (no pun intended), and it really rounded and leveled out my anxiety. It helps with GAD and trust me you will get a great night's sleep from it. It pretty much knocks you out, so you have to time it right. If the Mirtazapine somehow doesn't let you sleep all night, I would ask to switch out your short-acting Alprazolam for a longer-acting (8-hours) medication in the same or similar class, like Clonazepam. That way, you wouldn't be waking up in the middle of the night from the panic attacks, as you now have a steady controlled flow of an anti-anxiety med throughout the night. Odd that the doc didn't start it that way. But of course, everyone's biochemistry is different.   \nWould be curious to know if you do implement any changes and how the progress is going!

        "body": "Last night I was at 7/11 and I got back into my car after buying what I needed and 2 cars parked next to me and were kinda over the line on both sides. As a result I backed straight out instead of turning while reversing because I was worried that I\u2019d scrape one of them and tapped the rear bumper of a newer Mercedes suv parked directly behind me. I panicked and made a really stupid decision just left without thoroughly checking the damage, but my car was totally fine/undamaged so I assume his was too. As I was leaving and waiting at the light next to the 7/11 I saw the owner get back in his car without checking anything and start it, but the light turned green so I just left and didn\u2019t see him leave. I know Mercedes and other high end car brands have forms of collision detection with or without photos, so he may have gotten the alert. \n\nI went to the gym right after and was so stressed during my workout that I gave up and went home, and I lost so much sleep over it that night. When I woke up today, it was my only day off from school/work so I spent the day in my bed absolutely stressed out and trying to sleep just so I could avoid being awake and having to think about the situation. I ate once very little for dinner and was really quiet around my parents. I don\u2019t wanna tell them because I have a really bad history with cars (2 accidents, one was my fault and the other wasn\u2019t, but it led to my car being totaled which really stressed out my parents at the time) and I recently had 2 flat tires. I only told my mom about one of them and she got really angry, and 2 weeks later I punctured another tire on the way home from work and just got it fixed without telling my mom to avoid another headache. My point is that I don\u2019t want to stress out my parents about this and I don\u2019t want them to see as me as a liability.\n\nI\u2019m absolutely terrified about getting a call from my insurance about this, but they\u2019d likely contact my parents first as my insurance is through them. I also am a huge piece of shit for leaving. I was being selfish and the first thing my brain wanted me to do was to cover my own ass and leave without owning up to what I did. Is that a true reflection of who I am?\n\nI\u2019m dreading the next week or so because I feel like I could get that call that turns my life upside down at any moment. I know that there\u2019s not much I can really do except move on but it feels really hard for me to do so. I\u2019ve always gotten deathly worried over the littlest of things and I don\u2019t know how to change that.\n",

However I went today at 8pm on a Friday night and it was raining so hardly anyone was there, meaning I got a chance to try and learn most of the machines without feeling like I was being judged. Now I realise people aren\u2019t staring, they\u2019re just bored while waiting for their next set to start lol. Anyways I\u2019ve built a bit of confidence up that I\u2019m not as weak as I thought and next time I go to the gym, I won\u2019t feel so terrified to be around all the people. Something that helps me is putting on a little bit of makeup, I know it\u2019s extra but it makes me feel a little less insecure about my body and I\u2019m glad I broke that mental barrier of my fear of weights :)",

I feel like I should've learned my lesson by now but combined with GERD, it's really the worst thing ever. I woke up feeling nauseous and off, bought a small iced coffee at McDonald's, was fine the entire day, but when I got home I started feeling a pressure in my chest and tightness in my throat, and suddenly I started to feel like my thoughts weren't my own. My thing is, why does caffeine always affect me at the end of the day? Is it like a final burst of energy that just comes through? I spent 40 minutes trying to calm down and not have a panic attack, I was super nauseous and dizzy and thought I was going to lose my mind. I felt like I was seeing things in 3rd person and I don't know, it's awful. The worst part is feeling like I'm not in my own body and the derealization. Not to mention the headache I get afterwards.

The thing is sometimes it doesn't work, and I can't sleep at all, and right now I'm on holiday, but soon I'll get back to college and I fear that this habit of mine is going to fuck my schedule. Last year I was just looking Instagram or some YouTube video, and then I just left the phone aside and sleep. Now I need to look at the screen, until my eyes begin to close, and it has to be a series for some reason, in English, which is my second language, and with subtitles, because I understand spoken English perfectly, but it doesn't work if it hasn't got subtitles.  \nThis doesn't affect my sleep quality as far as I'm concerned, but it's not good that I depend on that to sleep. I really cannot sleep otherwise, I'd be in bed with eyes closed for hours and hours. \n\nAny recommendations on something I can do to replace this habit?\n",

Been thru alot of trauma to this day. Since 2022 my anxiety has felt deeper. When I go out to the store and there's a lot of people around, my heartbeat starts racing, I start sweating, my soul feels like it starts detaching from my body and I feel like I'm gonna pass out unless I get away from everyone in that instant. Last year in 2023 it started feeling worse because I started feeling like that while driving. Looking at the line behind me made me panic and feeling like I wanna pass out unless I drive off at the red light. This then started affecting my Dr appointments in the waiting lobby or going to places where there's people. I have been wanting to schedule an appointment with a mental health professional but I'm too anxious to go there and have to wait in a lobby around people. I'm really desperate because it feels horrible and I have a 5 month old son. I get mad at myself thinking I can't go out without feeling like this and how am I gonna take my son out to the store or to the mall or whatever. What should I do? I need encouragement to do something. I'm angry at myself and desperate for my family.",

                "body": "This sounds like a good example of the circle of anxiety. Our behaviours can make it worse and when having a anxiety response/panic attack when we leave areas or do something that makes us safe it reinforces negative coping mechanisms. \n\nWhat you would want to do is to find some coping mechanisms or distraction techniques to help change the intensity and duration of the panic attack. Sitting in the lobby of a doctors or professionals office without this just allows you to ruminate and focus more on the thoughts and feelings. \n\nI find that sensory items (fidget cubes, lollies, music as examples) can help preoccupy yourself when having an anxiety response and focuses your attention onto that thing rather than what your perceived threat is. \n\nWhen you break the anxiety circle you\u2019re more likely to reform better healthier pathways. It takes time and challenging. Have a look at some internet based cognitive behavioural therapy as an introduction, mindfulness and coping mechanisms/distraction techniques/distress tolerance skills.\n\nOnce a panic attack has started it will generally complete its cycle within 20-40 minutes depending on how bad it is, your brain is more likely to be preoccupied about the next one and the cortisol and adrenaline levels would be higher in anticipation.",

        "body": "Hi! I just wanted to post the anxious thinking I'm going trough right now, I don't know what I'm waiting for to happen venting on Reddit but oh well. Warning: My anxious thoughts are best described as what a teenager thinks is the end of the world when really all the suffering is in their head, this post may be very idiotic to read, and maybe it's because the situation itself is silly, the formatting in this post can be tedious. Enjoy!\n\nIn 2020 I met someone from another country with whom we became friends very quickly. At that time I was very trusting and I developed online friendships too quickly so I sent some pictures of my face, was very open about my age and date of birth, nationality, name, etc. \n\nTime passes (like 2 months?) and we end up being in a relationship, at that time I didn't give much importance to life itself and I used to absent myself in my own world. A month passes and she ends up telling me that she wants to end the relationship, I ask her to delete my photos and she agrees. Now if the lack of online security habits I had before didn't make me want to kms already, like the edgy teenager I was I told her that \"she never loved me\" and blah blah blah. Later she blocked me and that's where it all ended.\n\nI logged into some old accounts and it seems like I still have a Discord conversation with her, a part of me wants to go and apologize for being such a stupid person when I was young and settle the paranoias but at the same time I'm afraid that my my apology will make her want to take revenge on me. I dunno.\n\nNow that I have control of almost all my old accounts I plan to deactivate them and all that. The only thing that makes me hesitate to take the step of reaching out and apologizing is that at the time on another account I uploaded some screenshots of conversations with her friends in which basically they told me that I had done something bad for her to walk away and I don't know how many other things. Their users are not in the screenshots or anything but I'm still afraid that it would be one more reason to take revenge. I don't have access to that account, I reported it but (so far) the account has not been supended.\n\nI guess I'm worried about her unsuspending / reactivating all her old accounts and finding a way so she can find old posts, pictures or conversations and then use it to harass me or something.\n\nI'll probably end up talking to her if Discord still lets me message her, and I also feel a little stupid because that account might not even be in use anymore. In general I feel stupid for what I did in the past and how I am overreacting now haha.\n\nI am ashamed of having behaved like this a few years ago. Compared to other anxious people, I suppose this is rather a dumb fear, but I also find it annoying to live in fear of being persecuted. I don't know sometimes I miss when I was able to function usually.\n\nI just feel dumb about thinking so much and giving so much importance to something that happened four years ago and that no one really paid attention to at the time. Since 2023 ended I've been thinking about any kind of possibility of being harassed, any time I might have been considered a bad person or have done something bad. \n\nIf you got to this point thank you for reading haha, after reading this you are free to make fun of me, sometimes the things I think are quite funny.",

        "body": "Hello, just wanted to share my story with anxiety. My sister and I both have been struggling with anxiety for most of our lives. Sure, it makes sense due to genetics, living situations, and similar experiences and whatnot, so maybe it was bound to happen. However, our experience with mental health has brought us closer since we are the only ones who truly understand how each other feel. \n\nHowever, when I say we understand how each other, I don\u2019t mean this on a surface level \u2014 We quite literally experience the same exact symptoms, with the same triggers, coping in similar ways, and our anxiety debilitates us just about equally. Our triggers and symptoms are so similar, that you would think one got it from the other (or vice versa) \n\nTW: light emetephobia \n\n\n\nHowever, our triggers started from different traumatic moments in our lives relating to our fear, ones that weren\u2019t shared between us. I\u2019m not denying that we may have fed into each other, but it\u2019s just so crazy how similar we experience things. She moved away a few years back and even when we don\u2019t actively see each other, we still feel the same things and express it in the same ways. \n\nHere\u2019s just an example: I\u2019ve never met anyone in my life who has gotten an anxiety attack just because they feel cold when they shouldn\u2019t be cold. I\u2019m super anxious right now because i\u2019m cold and literally no one else i\u2019ve met who has anxiety has ever shared this feeling except my sister. We both fear being cold because we feel like there is something wrong with us and makes us feel sick. \n\nWe\u2019ve also adopted similar coping strategies, whether it\u2019s pacing around, calling our mom, texting each other, abusing our phone, staying inside, etc.  \n\nWe also both struggle socially due to our anxiety\u2014it\u2019s extremely hard for both of us to hang out with people and do stuff because of our anxiety. \n\nWhile we suspect our mom may have (undiagnosed) anxiety, she doesnt experience it in the same ways at all at a way smaller scale. \n\nWhile i\u2019m really grateful to have someone who gets exactly what i\u2019m feeling at all times, It\u2019s almost freaky how similar we feel to each other and WHY we feel the way we do throughout the years, even though we experienced different forms of trauma. \nJust wondering if anyone has had a similar experience with their family members! \n\nP.S. My sister and I have a 5 year age gap ",

Autism is hereditary.\n\nThe \u201canxiety attack\u201d from feeling cold sounds like autistic shutdown caused by hypersensitivity to cold, and probably other stuff going on at the same time that you\u2019re not aware of.\n\nPacing around is called stimming, a repetitive movement autistic people use to calm ourselves down when we\u2019re overwhelmed.\n\nYou say your mother doesn\u2019t experience it in the same ways at all at a way smaller scale, I bet she did when she was your age but has had many years to find coping strategies, or is just masking it, or a combination of both.\n\n[https://psychology-tools.com/test/autism-spectrum-quotient](https://psychology-tools.com/test/autism-spectrum-quotient)\n\nIf you\u2019re autistic, search for #ActuallyAutistic on YouTube for videos by autistic people to understand yourselves, I found them very helpful.",

        "body": "I had my daughter last February and started having bad anxiety last April. I tried Zoloft in June of last year and had an AWFUL experience. I wasn\u2019t sleeping, eating, I was out of body, etc it was awful. I stayed on that for an entire week unfortunately. I started Effexor this past September after being switched from Prozac. I feel a ton better but I still have days where I have anxiety, and some days I spend the entire day worrying that I\u2019ll feel like I did back in June again. One week I feel like I\u2019m getting better, then I spend the next week with anxiety and depression because I\u2019m once again not feeling well. Is this PTSD? How do you get past it? I keep telling myself that I want to be the person I was before the Zoloft. I\u2019m currently on 100mg Effexor but I\u2019m not in counseling. I\u2019m also a SAHM and I\u2019m with my thoughts all day which probably doesn\u2019t help. ",

Also, letting the pill dissolve under your tongue usually cuts the time it takes to feel the effects roughly in half to 15 mins or so.\n\nJust having the pills and having the option is sometimes enough and actually my last flight I didn't even take one! \n\nGood luck and safe travels!",

What I\u2019m saying is it\u2019s never as scary as you think it\u2019s going to be and we have to remind ourselves that we are safe even if our anxiety is making us feel like we aren\u2019t. We have to face what scares us because it\u2019s the only way to get through it, and now next time I have a blood test I won\u2019t be as anxious because this time I ended up being totally fine. I hope this helps others who are anxious about taking the leap and getting this done! \n ",

Not exactly short of breath, i can breathe in fully (sometimes, sometimes i do get short of breath)\nBut now anytime i get this, it feels like im breathing through a pillow or im suffocating under a blanket. Like im having to put effort to force myself too breath in, like somethings blocking my throat\nIs this normal?? should i go back to a doctor even though they already checked me out?\nit usually goes away when i stop thinking about it, but then i get aware of my breathing again and it feels like its still faintly there, which makes it worse cause i get anxious about it all over again.",

That\u2019s good that your doctor is giving you some meds! I\u2019m hoping that those work super well for you and make your panic attacks go away.\n\nYou said that when you stop thinking about it, it\u2019ll stop. I\u2019d try to use that to your advantage as much as possible. Maybe if there\u2019s something you can do to distract yourself when you feel a panic attack happening. I don\u2019t if that could be listening to music, or drawing, or maybe doing math problems or something to keep your brain engaged and away from thinking about your breathing. \n\nI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m no expert, but I hope you\u2019re able to make some progress soon! It may take time, but you\u2019re stronger than your panic attacks and you\u2019re gonna beat them \ud83d\udcaa",

My body acts up and then I feel just like I am deeply unwell/not safe.  Shallow, shaky breathing for HOURS (even when I am taking slow belly breaths), shaking arms, tense muscles in my legs and back, gurgling stomach, eyes sore, derealization, feels like my heart is vibrating (pulse not high).  Then I feel unsettled and agitated.  Unlike acute panic attacks that can ramp up quickly and pass, I can feel like this for days with only fractured sleep as a break.\n\nIn these times I somehow feel like the level of physical discomfort cannot be endured.\n\nTonight, while trying to eat dinner (no appetite and cannot unclench jaw) the automatic thought popped into my head\n\n\"Tonight I feel either like I'm going to die or like I want to\"\n\nNeither of which are true from a logical perspective. \n\nI'm so tired of these days. Which have been very frequent over the past 2.5 months. \n\nJust a rant. ",

        "body": "Does anyone have good coping mechanisms for health anxiety and how to overcome? I have always had health anxiety when it comes to physical symptoms in my body. I also have a ton of anxiety when it comes to medication. I used to not even take a whole Tylenol for a headache. Now it has become anxiety about mental health too. Like what if im actually bipolar, have BPD, become schizophrenic, what if I\u2019m paranoid instead of anxious, what if I become very depressed, pretty much any other mental illness there is. I\u2019ve only been diagnosed with anxiety and panic disorder but I do feel I have some ocd somewhere in there. And the panic only recently began 6 months ago. But now when I panic it\u2019s usually over a physical pain or if I think a negative thought, etc. it\u2019s like my mind picks things to get anxious about and then I spiral from there. And then when I panic, the physical symptoms of that make my health anxiety so much worse like I\u2019m dizzy so im going to pass out. I cant breathe so im also going to pass out. My chest hurts, im going to have a heart attack and my blood pressure is probably so high. And then keep panicking. How do I break this cycle!? Its so bad when I\u2019m alone because I\u2019m convinced something\u2019s going to happen to me or I\u2019m going to go crazy. I just want to live life again without constantly over analyzing my thoughts and my body and panicking from it. ",

I have always struggled with bad anxiety but having such a bad relationship made it 10x worse. I had no friends, couldn\u2019t go anywhere without him. He ended up breaking up with me. I thought that was me finished, I had nothing. Two years on and I now have great friends and my own life. I still struggle with bad anxiety but I\u2019m in a much better position than I was when I relied so heavily on someone who really didn\u2019t give me the time of day. \n\nAnyway, friends will come. I don\u2019t know how old you are but you can find friends in all walks of life, even with social anxiety. Just because you feel alone now doesn\u2019t mean this will always be the case. Maybe reach out to an old friend and see if they want to go for drinks and a catch up. It can seem so daunting but nothing will change unless you put yourself in some uncomfortable situations. \n\nIt\u2019s really shitty feeling anxious over someone but this feeling will pass. It takes time but it\u2019s all a learning experience. This is life teaching you how to overcome other things in the future. Everyone gets their heartbroken at some point. It\u2019s definitely not something to be scared of. I hope everything works out for you",

        "body": "To clarify, I have used Xanax on an as-needed basis, but the daily anxiety is so bad now and I can't justify using it everytime. From what I've read, Buspar seems like a nice daily med with fewer side effects than other options. This is specifically what I'm looking for, so if you've tried any other med that fits that description I'd love to know about it. I've also seen that some people take it with an SSRI, if I'm depressed, should I go this route, too? Or should I just start with Buspar and try using an SSRI with it later down the line? Could I still use Xanax as-needed with Buspar or should I try something else? If I use Xanax as-needed while on an SSRI will I get serotonin syndrome? I'd rather get rid of the anxiety than the depression so the SSRI isn't super important to me. I will also be going to weekly teletherapy visits. Sorry I know this post is stupid but I'm suffering so much and there's so many different kinds of medication it's hard to research it all before my appointment.",

                "body": "My anxiety started very very young. Like 3-4 years old. I\u2019m 29 now. I actually started meds in January. I probably should have started with meds at 13 which is probably the youngest age they would have prescribed them. Definitely by 16. Now I feel like if I had the tools to address the anxiety at a younger age I would have been better prepared to handle things for the rest of my life.\u00a0\n\nI wanted to avoid medication for a long time (the early 2000s attitude about meds and mental heath really affected me) but I got to the point when my situation and my anxiety was so bad that I was desperate for a quick fix. Like \u201cyes please give me a magic pill that will make everything better/ easier\u201d desperate. Even though logically (and chemically) I knew meds didn\u2019t work that way. So after 6 months of looking I found a mental health service I found one. From there I decided since I had to pay for it and I already wasn\u2019t a functioning human being I was gonna throw myself into the process whole hog. That included meds.\u00a0\n\nWhen I met my psychiatric nurse she immediately (within the first 5 minutes) was like \u201chere\u2019s your Prozac prescription. Go pick it up in 2 hours\u201d. It took me off guard but I since I decided I was throwing myself into this whole treatment process I went with it. It was too late at night to start that day so I waited until 10 am the next morning and I started taking it. It was a 7 day 10mg build up and my normal dose is 20mg.\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s been up and down from there. Up because I think in combo with the cognitive behavior therapy it\u2019s really helping. The chemicals in my brain are doing what they\u2019re supposed to do. I have more mental capacity to process things and do tasks that otherwise would have fed into my anxiety. Down because side effects. Lots and lots of side effects. Which literally is personal based on my specific super sensitive body chemistry (and more directly my overly sensitive immune system).\u00a0\n\nEven with all that I\u2019m not sorry I\u2019m trying the Prozac. Talk to your doctor(s). Be upfront and honest with them about your situation and more importantly your thought process. Meds are a tool meant to help you and help your brain chemistry function. There is nothing wrong with being scared of it. It\u2019s new and scary! But if you don\u2019t have those conversations then there is not much the professionals can do to help you.\u00a0",

And was given 50mg of Zoloft initially with Xanax as emergency use. I\u2019m now on 75mg. The only medication that I was hesitant on using was Xanax because i know people around me that have gone through crippling Xanax addictions, and was worried I would become dependent despite my psychiatrist reassuring me that I will be fine.\n\nMedication will definitely help you, stabilise your body chemically so you can work on yourself better. If you received that medication months ago, and your situation has changed, it may be a good time to go back to your doctor and tell them you haven\u2019t been taking them, and your current situation. They may adjust your medication or give you something else as well if it\u2019s really bad.\n\nIf anything you can always wean off your meds especially if it\u2019s not a high dosage but my QOL has improved significantly on medication.",

I\u2019d really only come to understand that it was anxiety a few years ago. Towards the end of 2023, I had become so anxious that it was affecting my work and I realized I needed to consider medication.\n\nBut just like you said, once I got the prescription a month later, I suddenly was worried I didn\u2019t need it. My anxiety was in a period of being manageable and I was worried about potential side effects. I convinced myself that maybe I was being dramatic and my anxiety wasn\u2019t severe enough for medication. Again, can\u2019t help but laugh because that was so clearly my anxiety talking.\n\nI held off starting my medication for a week after I got it. My husband said \u201cgive it a try, if it doesn\u2019t go well, you can stop.\u201d So I started with breaking my pills in half (my doctor definitely prescribed too high of a dose for first time use) and took that for a week. Then after talking with a psychiatrist, they suggested moving up to my full dose after another week of taking half.\n\nI\u2019ve been on it for a month now. I\u2019m so grateful I started. I had a few side effects in the beginning but they\u2019ve gone away now. I am shocked at what a more normal mind feels like, like the noise has been turned down.\n\nSo give it a try for at least a month. If you don\u2019t like it, you can always stop.",

                "body": "Technically 12 years, so too long. I was basically anxious from birth (I blame autism for that one) but it got bad when I was 10 years old, I was almost always anxious and nervous, my thoughts would spiral so easily and I would become obsessive over the anxious sensations I was feeling. Then my panic attacks started when I was 12.\n\nI was offered medication when I was 15 but they were basically just shoved at me with no explanation as to how they would work and I was far too scared to start after reading the side effects list. So I continued on and my anxiety and panic kept getting worse and worse. I caved just as I turned 19, because I was having panic attacks multiple times a day and felt so ill all the time that I needed some relief. But still, I was too scared to start actual antidepressants, so I was put on a beta blocker.\n\nThis didn't help one bit in hindsight, I have a chronic health condition that means my blood pressure is almost always too low, and the beta blocker just made me feel fatigued and groggy, but at least I wasn't sweaty anymore. I was on and off them for a few years until June 2023 where I finally decided enough was enough. I was 22 when I started mirtazapine last year and it's been nine months, I just upped my dose because my panic disorder relapsed (probably a PMDD thing) and I started feeling the full effect of it today. For the first time in 4+ years I woke up not feeling like death warmed over and filled with dread, I managed to take a shower without panicking and eat without ruminating on if it would give me food poisoning.\n\nHonestly, medication can be terrifying for a lot of us, there's just too many what ifs, so I completely understand and relate to the hesitation. I only wish I had the courage and the support system which would have allowed me to try this far far earlier. But I'm glad I have it now, because it's changed my life.",

        "body": "I'm usually anxious about every single detail in my life.\nMy (17 AMAB male\u2014to non-binary) conservative dad (60) has never liked my long hair. It's okay, not everyone has to like to my hair. The issue is that he recently has started avoiding to go out with me anywhere because I'd be a \u201cdisgrace\u201d to him. He thinks my hair is too feminine for a \u201cman\u201d like me and unpresentable. He's been treating me well and decently lately because mainly because he doesn't want to affect my concentration on my studies (I'm a 12th graders and your grade this year and this year only determines which college you'll get into). Anyway, I'm really usually anxious about my hair and I'm always alert\u2014that's really is so fucking mentally draining and tiring and affects every aspect of my life. I've been thinking about what if he one day has gotten fed up and just betrayed me and cut my hair when I'm sleep. I literally changed my sleep schedule to match him just to reduce the chances of him doing it against my wel\u2014he could never do it when I'm awake and I'd stand up to and fight him. It may seem unlikely to happen as some of my friends told me but I experienced very traumatic experiences in the past 3 years regarding that and I almost ended my life because of them. They were all related school hair policies, I had to cut it twice and he never supported me in any of them. I just am tired and can't handle anxiety. If this happens one more time i will never take it",

        "body": "To start this off I don\u2019t even know what the issue is but it ruined my life. Last year I started to worry about hypoglycemia because I was having symptoms that lined up with hypo. I eventually started checking my blood sugar with an at home meter. Some time went by and nothing seemed to be to crazy. But then all of the sudden anytime my blood sugar went under 90 I got this weird feeling in my upper chest. This feeling is extremely hard to describe, it\u2019s nothing like I\u2019ve ever felt before. The only thing that makes the feeling stop is eating carbs. I ended up stopping checking my blood sugar being everyone said it was just anxiety. It\u2019s been 7 months since I stopped checking and guess what it\u2019s still happening. I got labs done back in August and they came back normal so my doctor refused to do any other tests. Might I mention I have pretty severe agoraphobia so getting the labs done was not easy. \n\nI\u2019ve been so miserable with whatever the hell this issue is. It\u2019s been happening for almost a year now. It was so bad at one point I was getting the feeling in my chest every hour. Although it\u2019s still pretty bad now. It\u2019s making me depressed. I\u2019m sick of constantly having this feeling or having to eat when I\u2019m not even hungry just to make it stop. Now all I can think about when I eat is how many carbs and sugar everything has and what it will do to my blood sugar. I\u2019m sick of looking at food as relief of the feeling instead of eating when I\u2019m hungry. No one around me understands how much this is affecting me. I honestly don\u2019t even feel like me anymore because of this. I\u2019ve literally never experienced anything like this before this started happening. I don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019m genuinely so unhappy. ",

        "author": "cwsgray",
        "timestamp": "2024-03-01 22:56:12",
        "body": "Hey everyone,\r  \n  \nJust wanted to share something personal that happened recently. I\u2019ve been dealing with social anxiety for a long time, especially when it comes to situations like interviews, where you\u2019re put on the spot. It's always been a huge hurdle for me, making each interview feel like an insurmountable challenge.\r  \n  \nI landed an interview for a job I've been dreaming about for years. Knowing my usual anxiety would kick in, I decided to try something different this time to prepare. I found this tool\u2014I won\u2019t name it since I don\u2019t want this to come off as an ad or anything\u2014but it\u2019s basically a platform that lets you practice interviews with AI. It sounded a bit out there, but I was willing to try anything.\r  \n  \nPracticing with this tool was a new experience for me. It felt less intimidating knowing I was just talking to a computer. This setup allowed me to focus on my answers and delivery without the added pressure of being judged. It pointed out some habits I had when nervous, like talking too fast or not making eye contact, which I never noticed before.\r  \n  \nWhat really helped was being able to repeat the mock interviews as many times as I wanted. I started to notice a difference in how I approached questions, even the really tough ones. It was like building muscle memory; the more I practiced, the less daunting the responses became, and I started to feel more in control of my anxiety.\r  \n  \nWhen the interview day came, sure, I was nervous, but I also felt more prepared than ever. I used some of the techniques I practiced to manage my anxiety, like taking a deep breath before answering and focusing on maintaining eye contact. It wasn\u2019t perfect, but for the first time, I felt like my anxiety didn\u2019t completely take over.\r  \n  \nAnd guess what? I got the job. It still feels unreal. This was a huge personal victory for me, not just because I got the job, but because I was able to confront my anxiety in a way I hadn\u2019t been able to before.\r  \n  \nI wanted to share this here because I know I\u2019m not the only one who struggles with this kind of thing. Finding a method that worked for me made a huge difference, and if you\u2019re dealing with similar issues, it might be worth exploring different tools and techniques to see what helps you too. It\u2019s not about the specific tool or method, but finding something that makes you feel more comfortable and prepared.\r  \n  \nThanks for letting me share my story. This community has been a great place for support and advice, and I hope my experience can help someone else out there.\r  \n  \nWishing everyone the best in their own journeys. Keep pushing, and don\u2019t be afraid to look for help in unexpected places.",

I've only taken it about four times now and each time couldn't tell if it was working or not, but I just took one today and I feel like it's working but I can't tell if it's just a placebo effect.\n\nSome curious what everyone's experience has been with this for severe anxiety and ADHD.

        "body": "I\u2019m 28 male. Up until about 6-7 months ago, I was a very active person. Exercise daily, sometimes twice daily, 10,000 steps per day, plus weight lifting, yoga, workout classes, etc. Then I had what I thought was a bout of anxiety and I\u2019ve been essentially bed ridden ever since. I\u2019m constantly dizzy and my legs always feel weak. It\u2019s hard to shower or be on my feet for extended periods. I\u2019ve gone to the doctor about twice a month since then. They\u2019ve listened to my heart, I\u2019ve had probably five EKGs, wore a holter monitor for three days. I met with a cardiologist today and I\u2019m going to do a Tilt Table Test in a couple of weeks to rule out POTS, but the cardiologist didn\u2019t seem to think my symptoms were consistent with POTS (it\u2019s more constant than positional), and he ordered an echocardiogram too, for good measure.\n\nSo I\u2019m wondering: If something were wrong with my heart (or body in general), would we have found it by now? Or can heart problems hide? \n\nI\u2019m definitely anxious about it all, but my symptoms are so debilitating that it\u2019s hard to believe it\u2019s just anxiety. My doctors seem to agree it\u2019s more than just anxiety. For context, I\u2019ve also had a CT scan of my head, MRI with and without contrast of my head and top of spine, a couple rounds of bloodwork, and the aforementioned regular checkups. So far, there\u2019s not a solid theory. I guess POTS is the current hypothesis but again, it doesn\u2019t seem like a sure thing. Backup theory is that my body doesn\u2019t like SSRIs, which I\u2019ve been on since the initial anxiety flair (Lexapro and then Prozac).\n\nAny potential insight or reassurance would be appreciated.",

I've never been, and I'll get to practice my French, all around a great time. However, I'm really nervous because my friends are all going clubbing on Saturday night and it scares the hell out of me. I am not the type to go clubbing and I'm so scared that I'm not \"cool\" enough and I'll just be some weird guy lurking around. All my friends are cool and able to have fun in those environments and no matter what I do I'm terrified and I'm scared they'll all splinter and I'll be left alone and the alternative is sticking to them and then feeling bad for being a nuisance. It's funny because I'm a dancer and go social dancing all the time, but clubbing is just terrifying. I'll look stupid, embarrass myself or my friends, make them not have a good time, I don't know, I just know I'm not good enough to go with them, but I don't want to lose them either because I already feel like I'm slipping from my friends and I'm scared if I don't go I'll just be alone. This is definitely a byproduct of just being anxious that I'm losing my friends but yeah.\n\nI know that's kinda a half rant/half asking for help and I'm sorry but I just don't know what to do and I'm terrified and they're all so excited and it's all I can think about.",

Different medications work for different people, but benzodiazepines can start working within a few hours, and in some cases, moderate to severe symptoms can improve within 30 minutes. However, they can also be addictive within 2 weeks, and the addiction can be more severe than that of other drugs. Therefore, it is best to use them only temporarily, during emergencies, or when adjusting to other medications.\n\nThere are also medications with fewer side effects, such as SSRIs and similar meds, that are used for anxiety. It takes several weeks for the body to adjust and symptoms to improve. Like all psychiatric medications, withdrawal symptoms are inevitable. However, there are ways to improve and even cure anxiety, so why suffer? Therapy comes next. When symptoms are severe, medication is the answer. \n\nPlease seek help from a qualified psychiatrist.",

The day after I discovered that on my neck I read forums on here about lymphoma and now I have it stuck it my head that I have the \u201citch\u201d that it causes. Even after being cleared by my drs I still have it. I\u2019ve used antihistamines and they do not work. So I am wondering how to get rid of this itch? Does anyone have any suggestion or experienced anything like this? I try to stay busy so I don\u2019t think about it but the itch still happens. ",

It\u2019s debilitating right now, i work from home but I can\u2019t focus or do anything, and I straight up just talk to myself for hours arguing and venting trying to like self soothe and figure out my feelings but it just makes it worse. I don\u2019t know what to do, I have such a headache from being so stressed out and I feel physically ill like I have high blood pressure. It\u2019s not a full on panic attack but it may as well be, and I just need someone to talk me down or tell me what to do when this happens again. ",

I rarely have DP/DR, I\u2019m not scared to be by myself, or also go out in public and spend time with people I care about/go to work etc. My understanding is that it could take 2-3 full months to really see the effects of the medication, but I am so, so happy I decided to go this route.",

I used to only do calming yoga and meditation earlier, but I still felt just not okay. Adding physically challenging exercises to my routine helped me a lot. \n\nFor meditation, I've been using this app called Petit Bambou. They have guided meditation sessions for specific issues like anxiety. That helped a great deal as well, because it kinda helps you examine your triggers and your thought processes by giving your meditations a direction. \n\nFinding the exact things that work for you still needs some trial and error though. Hope this helps.\n\nAnd as always, this too shall pass :)",

You don\u2019t take pictures like this and it\u2019s kind of cringe for you, perfect candidate for ruminative reaction. \n\nAs people experiencing anxiety, we have to be vigilant and not always believe our thoughts when we are in ruminative reaction. \n\nI do it too, but now that I know I\u2019m ruminating, I have tools to get it to stop.",

                        "body": "This is very, very good advice. What you\u2019re experiencing is anxiety.\n\nI have only one addition: For me, obsessively ruminating is something I couldn\u2019t solve through logic, or even through therapy.\n\nPeople (including therapists) would tell me, time and again, that the thing I was obsessively worrying about wasn\u2019t a real or legitimate concern. They\u2019d take me through all the proven CBT approaches to provide perspective.\n\nSometimes their counsel wouldn\u2019t help at all. Sometimes it\u2019d help for an hour, or a day, but I\u2019d always convince myself they didn\u2019t understand the risk, or were just trying to make me feel better. I always ended up believing the risk was real.  At times, this would go on for months, or in one particular case, years.\n\nI have a great life. Extremely successful career, beautiful home, wonderful family, etc., but the YEARS of enjoyment anxiety ROBBED from me is almost hard to fathom.\n\nI bet if you\u2019re honest with yourself, this isn\u2019t the only time you\u2019ve obsessively worried about something like this. Your anxiety sounds similar to mine. It often manifested as a fear of being embarrassed, or being fired.\n\nFor me, the solution was medication. I take a low dose of Lexapro - and it\u2019s been LIFE CHANGING. I was just saying to my wife yesterday: I had a situation at work this week, which would have normally set me off (a presentation to our board which received some significant pushback).\n\nInstead, I was annoyed about it for a day, but could put the issue in proper perspective, and recognize that just because our board disagrees on this issue, doesn\u2019t mean they want to fire me.  I can look at the total body of work and say: \u201cOn balance, these people think I\u2019m doing a really good job.\u201d\n\nAnyway, I\u2019m not advocating for medication. But will say that for me, it\u2019s arguably the best thing I\u2019ve ever done. It likely saved my marriage, to be honest. There was no way my wife could have carried on with my obsessive rumination forever. And you are 100% for sure ruminating. Believe me: I had fears in the very same category, but worse. Nothing ever came of it.\n\nThis issue will pass, but anxiety will return until you deal with root cause through therapy or medication.  Take it from a veteran of this condition: Don\u2019t let it steal years of your life. \n\nBest of luck!"

The likelihood of this ever affecting your career in anyway ever at all is **very** low and even if it were to happen there is so much plausible deniability you could just say it isn't you. Or you could say yes it is me and so? Also you were 17 so it would be weird for someone to hang on to a pic like that of a kid. I don't even know why an employer would care about this although I could be missing something here. I would say most people have posted something online that they wouldn't want a future employer to see (bc you are a whole human being that exists outside of a job) and how many of them actually have lost their job over it? Most people would be unemployed at this point. We all do regretful things and it can be hard not to beat ourselves up over it but really I don't think you have to worry in this instance about this pic coming back to haunt you.",

        "body": "\nSo I just want to apologise in advance for what is essentially a rant into the ether. Especially considering I do already have a therapist I zoom once a week. \n\nDuring the second half of last year, my partner of multiple years decided to end the relationship. She is self-diagnosed autistic and is/was experiencing autistic burnout due to pressures and stressors outside of our relationship, and despite my best efforts, she didn\u2019t allow me to be of support to her in these areas of her life. We were living together and for all intents and purposes planning a life together. It all felt quite abrupt as only weeks/months before she ended it, she was consistently telling me how happy she was to have found me and how she only ever dreamed of a love like we had. \n\nI did plead with her (I didn\u2019t quite beg even though I wanted to) to seriously consider her decision and that ending our relationship didn\u2019t have to be the only way, I was happy to give her space to breathe and think if she needed it.\n\nShe said she just felt so blank due to the burnout that she couldn\u2019t see any other way but to end it. \n\nIt was absolutely crushing to me. I moved out of our place, the lease ended not long after and obviously we didn\u2019t renew it. I\u2019m living in a studio that belongs to extended relatives (paying them rent), and am constantly applying to rentals but having no luck.\n\nI\u2019m a freelancer but since the break up I\u2019ve struggled to keep up with work and have had to dip into my savings to keep up with bills, etc. \n\nI\u2019ve lived here less than four months and my relatives initially said I was welcome here until I found the right place. However very recently they started to ask why/how I haven\u2019t been approved for anywhere thus far. (They\u2019re wealthy boomers who own multiple properties and haven\u2019t rented since the \u201880s) I explained there\u2019s a rental crisis, competition is quite insane and some places are signing applicants before they even advertise inspections. (For clarity, I\u2019m applying for places my current salary would more than easily cover and I still have decent savings despite dipping into them, so I\u2019m not an undesirable prospective tenant). \n\nTo make things more difficult, my relationship with my mother who I was for the most part always quite close, since about 2022 has just absolutely deteriorated. I\u2019m not quite sure what\u2019s caused it but it was like overnight she just snapped and is a shell of her former self. She gets irritable even during a five minute phone conversation, when I have barely spoken to her. She\u2019ll become verbally abusive and when confronted with the language she\u2019s used, will immediately deny it and gaslight me. \n\nI can\u2019t work out if this due to menopause (she\u2019s in her mid 50s), unresolved trauma or just a combination of a lot of things but losing my mother as a source of emotional support these last couple of years has been harrowing. \n\nI know I have a lot be grateful for but also living with mental illness (depression, anxiety, cptsd and eating disorder) I feel like I can\u2019t keep up with it all. \n\nConstantly applying for properties and never hearing back is just beyond depressing, living in a property owned by people who deep down suspect I\u2019m just not trying hard enough to leave is weighing on me. I\u2019m still grieving a relationship that ended so suddenly and abruptly and mourning a future I will never now know, and having to distance myself from my own mother who in the past would have been a rock for me during a time like this. \n\nI feel like nothing but a failure and although I don\u2019t feel actively s****dal, I can\u2019t see any kind of future for myself or that I deserve one. \n\nI just feel like I\u2019m absolutely not coping and many of the aspects of my life that would have served as pillars of support previously are no longer in place. \n\n",

        "body": "Need some advice here.\n\nAfter a very bad past 2 months full of nervous breakdowns and panic attacks I've gone through multiple medications from my former psychiatrist. In the past month I've been on:\n\n50mg Sertraline (Up from my usual 7-year-standing 25mg)\n\n40mg Buspar\n\n20mg Propanolol (as needed)\n\n100mg Trazodone (night)\n\n25mg Seroquel (night)\n\nMy sleep went from 2-4 hours to 6 which is not great, but was enough of an improvement. My anxiety however still persisted and keeps getting worse and it felt like nothing helped. My former psychiatrist felt like she couldn't help me and recommended I see a psychiatrist that specializes in anxiety and sleep, whom I met with yesterday. \n\nHe recommended I get off the Sertraline & Buspar as they're not helping me and replace the Seroquel and Trazodone with Remeron (Mirtazapine). He wants me to slow taper the Sertraline to 25mg for a week and then stop. I explained to him that it's a lot of psych meds to be coming off of at once, and so quickly, and was very worried but he brushed it off saying I was on \"piddling\" doses and it shouldn't matter. He was very cold and distant, especially with how much visible anguish I came into the appointment with. \n\nLast night I took the Remeron with 50mg of Trazodone (I've read enough horror stories of trazodone withdrawal, I'm not going to cold turkey that one). I got tired but just couldn't fall asleep. Another hour later I took 25mg of Trazodone, a melatonin gummy, and finally when another 40 min passed, I caved and took a small amount (10mg) of Seroquel and finally was able to get a bit of sleep. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm already in a very fragile mind state and feel so much anxiety I can barely eat or do anything. I'm very nervous to be changing up all my meds, whether they're working or not. Does anyone have any advice or experience in changing up their psych med regime in such a short time?",

        "body": "I\u2019ve had anxiety for as long as I can remember. But after a severe episode 5 years ago, I had a year long of healing and learned how to deal with my anxiety through mindful practice and positive affirmations. \n\nHowever, I\u2019ve recently been dealing with a foul odour on my scalp and face that developed so suddenly. It\u2019s been so bad that people around have often reacted negatively towards me - like strangers looking at me with disgust and others even obviously covering their noses or pulling up their masks. At first, I could handle anxious feelings about people\u2019s reactions but I\u2019d come home dreading having to leave my apartment more and more. I reached a point where I physically could not get myself walk through the door. I didn\u2019t leave my apartment for 2 weeks straight. I ordered food and groceries and only went outside on my balcony. \n\nThe first time I left my apartment was to go to a psychiatrist and then a dermatologist. I\u2019ve been getting medical treatment for both my anxiety and my skin condition. I think I\u2019ve gotten better but I can still sense people reacting to how I smell and I can smell it too myself. \n\nI have not gone out with friends for 3 months, let alone a date. I\u2019m so afraid of being an anxious wreck\u2026 and I\u2019m having overwhelming thoughts of calling in sick. But I really want to go. Because that\u2019s the only way I think I can get back to my old confident self - like some exposure therapy. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I should let the guy know about how I feel beforehand and let him know that I\u2019m dealing with a skin condition that makes me smell bad. Or maybe ask him about it on the date if it seems it\u2019s making him feel uncomfortable. Or should I pretend nothing\u2019s wrong and practice grounding techniques before the date? \n\nI want to be brave and put myself out there but I\u2019m afraid I mess it all up by getting super anxious, freaking him out or smelling like sour milk on the date. \n\n\n\n",

One of them said he didn't smell anything but I saw his face change when he walked up to me and he kept rubbing his nose profusely after. I realised that my friends may not be as honest to me, so I started asking strangers. I won't lie this did make me feel a little crazy but I just wanted someone to, as you said, describe the smell so I can figure out what it is. Because, since I've been experiencing this for so long, I think I've become desensitized to the smell. Only two people pointed out a smell. One of them described it as an old/off oily smell and said it was coming from my face (I asked this poor stranger to sniff the top of my head, neck and nose /cheek area). The other said I smell like food and asked if I had a burger in my bag. To me, I used to smell like cheese/rotting egg and now I smell like sour milk or something I can best describe as raw/infected.\n\n  \nI know there is a smell - for sure. I just don't know if it will ever go away. I want to figure out how I can continue living my life with or without it. Because the anxiety I've developed around it has quite honestly taken a lot from me. I used to be outgoing, and saw my friends every weekend and dates every other weekend. I've never felt more alone, but the thought of leaving my apartment to meet a friend or letting anyone come near me makes me feel nauseous."

        "body": "I'm 29f, part of me doesn't even know if it is just anxiety, but everyone keeps telling me it is, and I haven't really felt anxiety similar to this since I was a teenager.\n\nI am very fortunate in my life and unfortunate in other ways. To put it mildly, I experienced a lot of loss last year, mostly family, but some friends too. It was quite bizarre, everyone just seemed to be passing away, for different reasons, including my grandfather, who I was very close to. \n\nI cope by forgetting and bottling things up quite a lot, I have kids, I'm married, and they're all great I don't have any complaints about that, but to put it bluntly, last year was the worst year of my life and, I barely ever cried, I held it in, I even made sure I was healthy and fit as a fiddle and able to be a good mom and person and wife and all that.\n\nAround January, maybe late December I got a lot of Caffeinated Iced Tea, and Mountain Dew, what can I say, I love the stuff. I have never really had a major issue with it, I have always been pretty fit and healthy, never even got chubby or anything, but I was drinking caffeine in excess for around 2 weeks, I'm not really sure why I was doing that, but I was doing it. \n\nEventually it lead to a point, I remember the day where I felt weird, I was already having these moments on the caffeine prior to this, this \"weird\" feeling, but it only happened after a sip this time, I thought I was having a heart attack, and I went to the hospital. \n\nAnd of course, as you might expect, it was nothing. They ran an EKG, did some blood work, etc, everything was fine. No excess caffeine in the system, nothing, they just recommend to me to stop drinking caffeine so I did.\n\nI stopped drinking caffeine cold turkey, entirely, family never got it for me every again, and I endured, painfully, for weeks and I figured I was just going through caffeine withdrawals, it felt like I was dying, I even ended up in the hospital again, shivering, cold sweats, thinking I was dying, and my vitals of course were fine, and they figured at worse, I just had a sensitivity to caffeine, so at worst I'm just going through some pretty nasty caffeine withdrawals but eventually they'll go away. \n\nWell they were kind of right, eventually they did, I was able to eat normally again, (I forgot to mention during this entire time I had almost no appetite and was losing weight), but I felt like I was in the recovery phase so to speak, and this was in late January, I started working out slowly but surely, and not pushing it too hard or too crazy. Doing cardio, squats, pushups, etc, I had a routine, I enjoy being active so it was nice to get back to that.\n\nAs crazy as this sounds during the withdrawals and anxiety, I couldn't enjoy or do much of anything and to be honest during this time, I ended up developing somewhat of a fear of going outside aswell, and even video games something I enjoy a lot even as a woman,  I just couldn't enjoy, and would even stress me out to the point where I thought I was gonna die. \n\nWell after my so-called \"recovery\" from the withdrawals I ended up yunno having these moments, where things weren't right, even when I did feel right.\n\n30 minutes of cardio became 25, because when I tried to go past 25 I felt like I was about to have a heart attack, 25 became 15, which became 10, which became nothing.\n\nDoing any workout felt similarly which made me think, God am I, dying? I play a lot of Fortnite actively (I know lol), and I even reached Unreal rank primarily in solos (very stressful) but at a certain point, even casual matches, or even getting chased in a creative map, were pushing me to the point where I felt like I was going to die. \n\nThis has continued to the point of up until a week or two ago where I had my last \"good day\" where I finally thought, maybe all those bad days I was feeling was just PTSD about the caffeine withdrawals and anxiety about that, and on that day I really enjoyed myself and thought I was fine, I did 15 minutes of cardio (which considering the decline was good for me) I did a full workout other than that, played Fortnite, went outside, spent time with my family, enjoyed my life, and then the next day happened, where I tried to do cardio, and it just, I felt like I was going to die.\n\nI couldn't even talk to my husband, I tried, I felt like I was going to die, I sure as hell couldn't play Fortnite, I couldn't even read things, outside was impossible. This has continued to the point where I have been pretty much bedridden and worried that I'm dying for easily over a week now. I have gone to the hospital yesterday, the third time in the last two months, and they ran more extensive tests, even an xray, and they said I was fine.\n\nI even had my mother who is in her 50s with me during that time, and walking outside after all the tests, felt so bad I felt like I was going to die, I had to hold her hand, outside scared me more than anything I feel like I somehow developed some sort of agoraphobia.\n\nI cannot function like this. I cannot take care of my kids, I cannot be a good wife, I cannot enjoy games, I cannot workout and take care of myself, I cannot read manga, I cannot watch shows, I can't enjoy anything, I can't even do anything.\n\nI'm terrified of dying, and everytime I get out of bed I feel so weak, I have lost 20 pounds, without trying from my lack of appetite. I know it's probably not my heart, but I am worried I might have cancer or something else and I know I need to see a doctor, a specialized one and a generalized one, but I can't even step outside without feeling like dying, I have problems even leaving my room.\n\nI'm worried this will either be my life or I'll end up dead without being able to see the future and nobody will have figured out what was wrong with me.\n\nI'm so tired of not being able to enjoy or do anything. I want to be normal again. I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm going to be bedridden forever now, I don't know what I can do.",

                "body": "Hey Brendyrose,\n\nSorry I can\u2019t be more help but I want you to know that you\u2019re not alone. About a month ago (times been a bit of a blur) something similar happened to me, except it happened when discussing the news with a family member. All of a sudden I felt weird and had a massive panic attack. Ever since then my anxiety has not gone back down substantially.\n\nSomeone on this subreddit told me that anxiety stems from a fear of uncertainty. I know for me that the feeling of impending doom that anxiety gives can be paralysing.\n\nAnother thing to consider is if you\u2019re in a heightened anxious state, you\u2019re basically stuck in fight or flight mode. In the modern world where are fears aren\u2019t always right in front of us (like they may have been thousands of years ago when we developed this response) this can confuse our brain and make it hyper focus on the fact that something, anything is wrong.\n\nI\u2019d be a hypocrite if I tried to tell you what to do. But I can give some recommendations that have helped me:\n\n- walking my dog and talking with him (crazy I know).\n- exercising. I know you said this is a current trigger. But if I feel my anxiety rising or a panic attack coming on, I slow down my cardio, but I don\u2019t stop.\n- talking about it. This is easier said then done. I have a relative who is very accomodating to me.\n- Talk with a doctor. But make sure it\u2019s a doctor you trust. I made the mistake during a bout of anxiety of making an appointment with a doctor I hadn\u2019t been to before and he basically fobbed me off. When I went to my regular doctor he was more accomodating.\n\nI\u2019m hopeful that other people will reply and offer more support and suggestions. There is a lot of people who have been through this (or are going through it) who give good advice and can hopefully help you feel a bit better.",

On paper I was healthy  at home I was bed ridden, couldn't watch my shows, couldn't, play video games, my wife could even show when she was in pain. Any little thing, and I mean little would set me off with anxiety. \n\nGiven time I still have days when I can't get out of bed, some videos games are to much, can't be around other people, can't leave the house.\n\nI know how hard it is to parent with all this going on, but know you are doing your best and you are not alone. Just being there to talk to your kids is good enough, trust me. \nDo your best, breathe, talk to a Dr. And a therapist. \n\nIt gets better, very slowly, and maybe some step back words, but keep moving forward, you are not alone.",

I can't even enjoy the singleplayer or co-op stuff which really bums me out, and of course Fortnite being my main multiplayer game, there's a lot of FOMO inherently built into that game which is something that gives me anxiety aswell ironically enough since I am worried that whatever I am going through now will interfere with me being able to unlock everything before the current season is over.\n\nMy kids are handling how I am very well luckily, my family is great, but clearly i'm not. I don't really like how I can't really narrow down the reason for my anxiety as easily as some other people are able to, maybe because of traumas and loss that I just can't really even bring myself to be aware of or care about. I guess I have just always been very stoic even as a girl which, probably isn't very healthy and it's probably catching up to me in a pretty bad way, at least that's what i'm assuming is going on. \n\nI hope I can muster up the ability to see a doctor just in case it is a health issue but I really have a hard time going outside, it feels, truly awful to the point of death/impending doom. \n\nFunnily enough when I was younger I definitely did have a bit of health anxiety but this was almost 10 years ago, and it became a natural loop of anxiety about anxiety, but I never thought i'd go through this again, but I guess it's surprisingly common. I think it actually might feel worse when you get older too, which sucks."

        "body": "28m  \nWhen everything is fine, and my day is normal without stresses or significant events, I can fall asleep relatively easily, I sleep quite reasonably.   \nBut...   \nIf something, even a small one, causes me to have anxious or stressful thoughts, my brain goes into racing mode I go to bed, my legs feel uncomfortable, I feel warmth in my body, my brain doesn't stop thinking about that stressful event, about the tension, I start thinking why I said what I said, why didn't I act differently, what will happen now? Will anyone be angry with me for saying something I shouldn't have said? It's something that happens to me every time.  \nLet me give you an example:  \n The other day I was at work One of the employees asked me about another employee, what I thought of him. The employee who asked doesn't really like the employee he asked me about I replied that I didn't like him very much either, because I thought he was arrogant, But you have to manage because it's a workplace.   \nThe conversation ended, I drove home The day was normal, everything was fine But when I got into bed, the pressure suddenly began. What would happen if he told that arrogant employee what I said about him? Maybe I'll be fired? Maybe the same employee will harass me? Of course, nothing happened after that But I lost three days of sleep Out of stress, anxiety and worry  \nOne of my problems is that I like to talk to people, and when I start talking, I talk and talk Every time I find myself in situations that I later regret. Sometimes I say things out of stress and anxiety Sometimes I intervene in people's conversations just to calm myself down, like that they're not mad at me or that the boss isn't going to fire me I just want to hear and be in the loop, and then I start talking, and sometimes I say things that on quite rare occasions really got me in trouble  \nEverything I have described, is this something that some of you also feel? Is this something common in anxious people?\n\n  \nHow do you cope?  \n",

I don't want to say I acted impulsively, but rather on instinct. The right action would sort of appear to me. People around me didn't seem to comment either way. If they did, they could fuck off.   \nRecently, I was at a group dinner with a bunch of acquaintances. Friends of my sister. They were recounting an experience they had earlier in the day where someone seemed to purposefully rear end them; clearly there was some sort of scam afoot. But I couldn't help but overly sympathize with the person who would need to do the scamming. It took me out of the conversation and into the role of devil's advocate.   \nI think a lot of people would call this empathy? But this chronic, compulsive empathy feels like torture? I'm incapable of having an opinion.   \nThird example. I'm a woman. I've always presented hyper-feminine. I wear makeup on most occasions, I dress in a traditionally feminine way, and I spend time and money to improve my appearance. And some days I didn't. Some days I was hungover, going to the gym or didn't feel like it. Clearly there was an external force at play (patriarchy) but I never actively considered the external force. One the days when I didn't, I never assumed anyone would care or notice.   \nI'm unhappy because of all of the above. But I don't know how to go back? Help. ",

        "body": "Hi all. New here.  \n\n\nDiagnosed with ADHD and GAD this past January and was put on a stimulant. I requested a low dose because I'm generally sensitive to medications/substances on general. First month was great, had clarity/focus and a quiet brain for the first time in my life, however my fidgeting was still pretty bad and after I got used to the medication, my focus issues came back, though not as bad as pre-diagnoses.   \n\n\nAt my 1-month check-in, doc and I agree to up my dosage. I took this dosage for a week and a half with no issues and even better results than with the previous dosage. Then exactly halfway through my second week on this dose, around the midday when my first dose began to wear off, I began to experience \"air hunger\". Lots of yawning and gasping trying to get that full-feeling breath of air which would only work every once in a while. This has persisted for a little over 2 weeks now. I have yet to pinpoint any one thing that helps. There does seem to be a pattern of it not bothering me so much if I'm not thinking about it, but I'm still unsure if it's my brain/anxiety doing this or not.   \n\n\nI have tried a lot, from cutting my stimulant dosage back to what it was before this started, to not taking it at all. I am currently on day 2 of not taking my stimulant at all and the sensation is still here. I have also tried to eat more/drink more water, get more sleep (I have horrible sleep habits and average between 4-6 hours of sleep a night). I've tried different breathing exercises as well. My doc prescribed me buspar for anxiety when he upped my medication for ADHD but my anxiety prevented me from taking it. When I sent my doc a message about what's going on, he said that I need to start taking that and we will review further on our next check-in, which is next week. I did start on that, which seems to help I think? But I have also read that buspar can take weeks to start working, so I'm struggling a lot with identifying what causes the waves to come and/or go.  \n\n\nAt one point earlier this week, I fixated so hard on trying to get a deep breath that I sent myself into a fit of hyperventilation and panic. (This is what prompted me to reach out to my doctor before my scheduled appt with him.  \n\n\nI don't really have any other specific symptoms that point towards heart failure or lung disease, based on what I read online. But it's still freaking me out. Is anxiety doing this to me? I've never experienced this or anything like it before. I've had anxiety my whole life but only recently started trying to treat it. (35m).  \n\n\ntldr - Can't decide if this sensation of shortness of breath is anxiety, medication, pulmonary issues, or something else. I *am* able to breathe, but it doesn't *feel* like I can get a deep enough breath alot of/most of the time. ",

        "body": "Pos trigger warning. \n\n29(F). I am losing it. Aside from finding basically anything to sent me over the edge into a panic/anxious spiral, now I'm terrified that my \"anxiety\" has been seizures. I was diagnosed with my second \"panic attack\" last July. I spent a very long day in the sun with no shade or AC (and no water but drank hot coffee for some reason) and when we sat down for dinner that afternoon felt a sudden like lurch? Almost like I was suddenly waking up even though I had been aware. Then I got hot/cold and just felt off. I moved to a couch and relaxed the rest of the day. I wasn't tired but felt really anxious from what I remember. After that I was prescribed sertraline and took it for about 7 months before stopping. That October I started having eye and nose fasciculations. To be fair, LOTS of stressful events had been occurring back to back throughout the year all the way until now. Over the past two months though I have been in a pretty bad anxious/panicked state almost every day. To make it worse now I'm wondering if my symptoms actually are more like seizures and that fear is getting in the way of starting up the sertraline again. I feel like I can't win, I was scared to death over something in my relationship, over flying, over MS/ALS, over cancer, over endometrious, and now over seizures. I feel like my doctors aren't really responding or taking my symptoms seriously and my next therapy session isnt for another two weeks. \n\nSomeone please tell me I'm being ridiculous or that there's a way out of this.\n\nTLDR: anxious that physical symptoms are seizures misdiagnosed as GAD and panic disorder. Lots of evidence to suggest the later, but I can't bring myself to believe it or not worry about a misdiagnosis making everything worse. ",

I don't usually use this saying, but he needs to \"stay in his lane.\"\n\nI had an \"eye stroke\" in 2020 that left me blind in one eye.  As part of the follow up, they had me meet with a neurologist.  I told him I had a history of migraine, diagnosed in the 1990s.  I was asked if I'd seen a neurologist for it.  I said no, at the time my MD just acted like management was through the PCP.  He said that was typical back then, but not now.  He recommended 400 mg magnesium glycinate and 400 mg riboflavin daily.  Now, every so often, I get an aura, but little to no pain.  As a teen, my oldest went through several months after a diet change (went vegetarian) of fatigue, barely able to keep balance, every so often loss of limb function.  The whole thing pisses me off, and there's much more to the story, but the short is, they got almost no vitamin D.  One 4000 IU supplement and I had my child back.\n\nSupplements have a purpose.  They may not be well-studied for certain conditions all the time, but there can be enough anecdotal evidence that they work for certain things.  My neurologist couldn't tell me why riboflavin/magnesium work, but they do, and give it a try.  Placebo effect?  I suppose, maybe.  Does it seem to work for me?  Yeah.  And I take vitamin D as well and feel better too.\n\nSo if you feel better taking your supplements, take them.  And if you have questions?  Talk to your doctor.  Don't ask your therapist.\n\nEdit:  if you disagree, that's fine, but at least reply and explain what you disagree with.",

If that\u2019s the case, I think that could still be normal. I think some people with anxiety do just have a generalized feeling of anxiety, not anxiety tied to any particular event. \n\nHave you talked with a general practitioner about your symptoms? It seems to me that while they could be symptoms of anxiety, it\u2019s possible that they could the result of some other medical issue. Chest pain and tachycardia are symptoms you should take fairly seriously. You may want to bring those up with a doctor :)",

Don\u2019t over react by going to the hospital or something like that (i called 911 the first panic attack i had lol). Just remind yourself that panic attacks are uncomfortable but not dangerous.

I have no friends, the only guy that I tought was my friend cyberbullied me everyday while we were playing videogames, telling me about how bad I am, that I have no friends and that I'm worhless, I've recently cut contact with him after having what felt to be a stockholm syndrome for him just becouse he was calling me everyday and sometime asking me how I am doing. My pills don't do shit, my mom - a person that I have a horrible relationship with, among other things, refuses to change my psychiatrist or in fact do anything I ask her to so that I could have a more half-decent life. Self harming is a problem I've had for a much longer time, I tought it stopped but it's starting to get back to me. All I do everyday is having the same routine of rotting away - going to highschool, eating and drinking sugary shit so that I can drown my sorrow into an addiction that slowly kills me and playing videogames like League of Legends, DayZ and Minecraft. I'd offer anything to have a normal life, to have one good friend I could talk to and maybe even play videogames together, to not be tormented in my dreams, and now worse, in my fucking head, by the bad decisions I've done in the past, the bad decisions that I do every day to destroy my relationship with my family, to destroy my own mind and body, by the voice in my mind that sometimes feels like is the only \"person\" who understands me. \nPlease help me, I'm begging to be saved from this.",

How can I process this emotion correctly?  only way I know if I will check it will go away but then I just keep on checking again and again and again.

This is from having low tolerance of uncertainty. Checking lowers this tolerance. But not checking and therefore staying in uncertainty raises it.\n\nIf you find it too hard to resist the urge to check, try implementing a rule of always waiting two minutes from the moment you decide to check.",

        "author": "wahooo92",
        "timestamp": "2024-03-01 17:43:45",
        "body": "I'm really trying to help and be supportive to my partner, but it's very difficult especially in the moment. His mind races at a million miles an hour and he's very hurt and I feel bad, but it's usually quite literally all in his head and idk how to express that without coming off as \"invalidating\" and \"dismissive\". It's also clear that his mind races to \"justify\" the hurt he's clearly feeling.\n\n----- example -----\n\nTake for example, he asked me to do an errand, I said yea let me put in some time in my calendar. I noticed I was busier than I thought, and had to do some shuffling to get things to fit.\n\n Somehow in the space of a minute his brain took this to mean I was refusing to do the errand, that he can never ask me to do errands again, that the mental load of errands will always all fall on him, and thats too much for his brain which makes him a failure and means we can't work as a partnership and our house will fall apart. I kept reiterating that my schedule problems had nothing to do with the errand and that the errand just inspired me to have a look, and that it'll be done, but it fell on deaf ears.\n\nAfter he expressed that he will never ask me about chores again, I let out a surprised \"woah there, okay\", as thats quite a strong sudden statement and I was trying to collect my thoughts. He broke out sobbing saying i that that was a dismissive and invalidating statement and I was being awful to him. And like I get it *he's hurt, but I don't think I'm the one causing it, I think it's his own brain*. \n\n---------- solutions \n\nIn this case luckily he got a 20 min call, where a friend was just updating him about some travel plans, and it completely snapped him out of it. He was no longer upset at me, the world was no longer ending. Great! I just wish we didn't have to go through all of this.\n\nIn general, distracting him seems to be the best solution - either he's no longer upset or he's actually regulated enough to have a reasonable discussion, but its hard to do that in practice. I mean I get it, i would be mad if I confronted someone about a concern and was met with \"go on a walk and let me know if you're still upset in half an hour.\".\n\nBringing up his previous behaviour doesn't work, bc he reasons that he was very hurt and thus had the right to express that hurt. He points out that he's not abusing me, screaming, insulting, hitting, etc, but \"only\" sobbing and \"expressing his grief\", and that he should be allowed to do so. He also plays down just how distressed he gets.\n\nHe pulls the whole \"normalise men crying and expressing their feelings\" as if I'm the reason Movember exists. Yea sure, but it's not fair for me to be the target of it nor is it fair to treat me like a captive audience, and I wish I at least got some recognition that his behaviour wasn't okay or that he's even mildly apologetic.\n\nFWIW, his mom is exactly the same, and he complains all the time about his mom, but fails to recognize the behaviour in himself. He knows he has anxiety and is an anxious person, but never in the moment. And he snaps and says I'm invalidating him if I suggest he is being anxious.\n\nI'm really trying not to invalidate, and the pain seems tremendous, but I'm also not going to \"validate\" that x friend hates them now or is otherwise an asshole bc they haven't replied in 2 days, which is another example of when he's spiraled. These spirals maybe happen once a fortnight.\n\nI think that for him, acknowledgment that he's dysregulated in the moment, means an inherent invalidation of his feelings, which creates shame, which makes things worse, and that's how things keep going. And I feel bad, I really do, but what am I meant to do or say? \n\nAny help? What helps you guys? What can I do to help when his mind jumps to some pretty disastrous conclusions, and what is harmful that I might not be aware about? Any help is very appreciated. ",

                "body": "with the context given and lack thereof (age? Cultural background?  kids? location etc) - I would suggest a few things to keep in mind; \n\nOne thing we can\u2019t control is our feelings. they are response triggers from previous experiences and maybe the repetition of them. \n\nFor example, myself, I always had a hard time speaking up and would shut down as a child (still do this sometimes as an adult) because I had an accent, had ear infections as a child which didn\u2019t allow me to enunciate words correctly because I literally couldn\u2019t hear the sounds correctly - I would say batman as \u201cmem\u00e9\u201d (not with long vowel e, short e) thus my childhood nickname. \n\nAnyways, that caused me anxiety growing up, speaking in general because i felt people would make fun of me- i couldn\u2019t control how i felt BUT as I grew older, I realized that as much as we can\u2019t control our feelings, we CAN control how we react to them and most importantly what we SAY and DO about it. \n\nI don\u2019t think your S/O has bad intentions but I also think he can express himself in much healthier ways both verbally and physically. \nPersonally, distractions will not solve the root of the issue; Discipline and communication will, and if the love/patience (which looks like you do have, hence this post) is strong enough, then you two can overcome it slowly but steadily. \n\nIn regard to Anxiety in general, what has helped me alotttt is practicing Stoicism, my faith, and a life of gratitude with an amazing wife. I always tell my scholars \u201cif you wake up and tell yourself you\u2019re going to have a shitty day, even if everything goes right, you will still have a shitty day\u201d; we can\u2019t always trust what we feel, which is important to manifest good thoughts and better actions reinforced by good habits/discipline. Not making excuses. There are very healthy ways of dealing with negative emotions: chanel them through healthy coping mechanisms, as best as you can, through exercise, asking for space to recollect thoughts, and walking. Anything to stay more present. \n\n Of course, if it\u2019s debilitating and a severe form of anxiety, professional help is the way to go. Hope this helps!",

It has been like 3 weeks since we have played toghether and i see he wants to play but im too scared. for some reasons its only with this friend because with my others friends if they told me to play i would hop online in a heartbeat to play. i still really wanna be friends with him and i dont know if its because hes a nice friends or if its because of his social rankings. I dont know if our relationship is really going anywhere and is making no progress as he has his own friend group and hes much more comfortable around them than he is with me as he will be punchin them as a joke and they will be punching eachother back but when its just me and him talking i feel its so awkward but i know he still wants to be friends with me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\ni really need help with how not to be nervous and awkward around him and also how to feel more comfortable around him.",

        "body": "Hello  \nTo give some relevant background about myself, i am 29 years old. I have a sister who is 3 years older who has been suffering from full blown schizophrenia since 2019. Apparently 2 of my grandma's sisters also had it on my mom's side of the family. I started smoking weed in college in 2015, and pretty soon i was addicted and smoking daily. I also used LSD 9 times from 2016-2017. Back then i didn't know about my family's history of schizophrenia. My sister started having symptoms and an eventual diagnosis in 2019. I continued to smoke weed almost every day until January of this year. I am now 2 months sober. I haven't had any symptoms of schizophrenia, but i am worried that my past weed habit will come back to bite me in the ass. I have signed up for therapy at a therapist who works with addictions. I am having anxiety about the prospect of triggering my own schizophrenia from smoking weed and using LSD. I know schizophrenia symptoms typically appear in men at a younger age than at 29 or later, so i want to convince myself that i got lucky and will be healthy, but for some reason I can't get over this anxiety.  \nAny words of support would be appreciated.  \n",

I have problems reading, understanding words, and sometimes I can\u2019t even speak properly. It can linger on for a while but goes away when you get to a generally calmer state of mind.

                "body": "Yeah u could go that route about more and more drugs .. until there's no end but even more drugs; the only thing that works for my physical symptoms of anxiety is Propranolol - a Beta Blocker that calms down ur racing heart, shaky voice/hands/trembling body.\n\nBesides this almost magical level of curing the physical symptoms, I found no such similar pill for the mental anxiety.\n\nWithout getting much into deep philosophy / psychology, life is meant to be rough, it's some kind of punishment from the past life. \n\nIf you're trying to cheat your way into happiness by overdosing on drugs, even if they make u x10 better ***temporarily*** that's the main keyword here - once its active effect vanishes: you'd *at least* subtract this -x10 of happiness, which in terms makes u even more sad like -x20, solely for the reason that you \"used to feel so good a few minutes ago and you wish you felt like it forever\". But the next dose might need to be higher than the already high dose.. What a downward spiral!\n\nI think the best way to deal with it is something like CBT therapy or its improved version that's: ACT (Acceptance & Commitment Therapy), there's great bunch of videos on YT for free by this woman: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhA804y76Ug](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhA804y76Ug)\n\nBesides her I've read 100s of blogs about it, but the general idea is about the \"*Don't think of a purple elephant\"* paradox, where you're not trying to suppress your negative thoughts because they will become more problematic to your brain, but rather acknowledge them and if they aren't helpful then try focus on the positives.\n\nWhile doing this you must never be afraid of negative thoughts, the only way to become mentally stronger is to accept & face your fears as-are.\n\nAlso the next idea is you don't become your negative thoughts, you just separate yourself from it, like, instead of saying: \"I am stupid for having said that!\" -> you change it into: \"I have this thought of 'feeling stupid that I said that'\". \n\nPower comes from being non-judgemental about it, you can label it as \"bad/useless thought\" but **don't** call yourself a \"bad person\" for having those thoughts. Thoughts, both positive and negative, come and go, involuntarily! Luckily you have control over being the \"filter\" of your thoughts!\n\nI'd like to hear if at least some of it was helpful/touched your issue?",

Naturally my anxiety is very high, I began having episodes where I feel hot and lightheaded and my pulse gets extremely high. They only last for a few minutes but are so scary. I had a holter monitor and blood tests and every thing was normal but my iron was low. It seemed to get better for a while and I wasn\u2019t focusing on it. Recently after a month sick, the episodes have returned and now I\u2019m also having a lightheaded feeling all the time and it feels like I\u2019m going to pass out. I\u2019m also super short of breath. I\u2019ve been to the er and they\u2019ve ruled out blood clots and lung issues and I had an echo and more blood tests and normal heart. Do you think this could just be anxiety? My anxiety about these episodes is extremely high and I know that\u2019s making it worse. I also wasn\u2019t taking my iron pill for a while so I know that contributed. I keep making doctors appointments, but at this point I think I need to stop because it just furthers the obsession and anxiety. How do you shift out of the sick perspective? How do you let go of the \u201cwhat if it\u2019s something serious\u201d feeling? Thanks",

                "body": "Hi, it could be from anxiety. Usually if you have physical symptoms and doctors don't find anything, it's probably from anxiety. \n\nAnd the way to improve your anxiety is to abstain from any reassurance. Meaning no checking symptoms, no googling, not even telling yourself you'll be fine. Just sit with the fear. The thing is, this anxiety is coming from having low tolerance of uncertainty, which can baloon any possibility of something dangerous into extremes. And any reassurance will futher this already low tolerance. But if you sit with uncertainty without engaging in any reassurance, you slowly raise your tolerance of uncertainty, making all these symptoms weaker and less frequent. Also doctor visits are a big form of reassurance, so better do that only in a reasonable amount.",

        "body": "Ugh. This will probably be kinda long, sorry.\n\nA few weeks ago I was working a project at my job. I\u2019m a middle manager for the scheduling department of a medical entity, so I\u2019m putting notes in on patient charts from time to time just to explain why I\u2019m in there. Pin this thought.\n\nThe project involved sending out letters to clients regarding a few of our providers moving clinics. All in all there were about 4000 clients affected, so it was a multi-day project. During this time, my supervisor was out, and sometimes when she\u2019s gone, my team members can be a bit troublesome. There are a few of them that have been here longer than me, but aren\u2019t happy that I got promoted when they didn\u2019t. Because of this, when the supervisor is gone, they like to dogpile me for my decisions in leading the team. It\u2019s usually not a terrible amount of dogpiling, usually one or possibly two people will lock onto me but I\u2019m used to it and just try to stonewall my way through the situation and let my supervisor and department manager know what\u2019s going on. This particular day both my supervisor and the department manager were gone for the afternoon.\n\nOne of these team members cornered me about one of our systems and accused me of secretly pulling team members off of this system to work on something else (which I didn\u2019t do. I try not to touch that system\u2019s team because of how busy it gets). This team member and I have a pretty rocky relationship, but I have no authority to dole out punishments, so she knows that i can\u2019t really do anything myself when she behaves like this. My supervisor, god love her, doesn\u2019t like to do write ups for behavior that doesn\u2019t disrupt the workflow or occur when she\u2019s there and prefers to do coaching sessions instead, which usually means that people get away with stuff Scott free.\n\nAnyway.\n\nI copied the conversation to send it to my supervisor and the department manager for their records, and went back to sending letters because it was my priority, and didn\u2019t think much of it. While I was working this project, I had to copy and paste a note template. The template was pretty much complete and all I had to do was sign off on it, so for better or worse I was in autopilot mode. Project was handled and I went back to my normal duties the next afternoon.\n\nToday one of my team members called me to tell me that she had found a patient chart that had that message exchange in place of the proper contact note template. I quickly put in for the records department to remove the note, but I\u2019m still terrified I\u2019m going to be fired, or at least written up. I immediately called my supervisor to tell her the situation, and she let the department manager know,  but I\u2019m still absolutely terrified. I tried to remain level-headed in the messages but I\u2019m still scared this could still spell trouble for me. This is one of the few trans-friendly employers that pays a decent wage in my area. I really can\u2019t afford to lose this job.",

                "body": "I believe a lot of my anxiety came from my parents because they were very controlling, we did not have much space and they always mentioned the worst case scenarios whenever I was by myself and always told me they know better. I resented them for it.  I am now an adult, I live by myself and I still have a lot of anxiety that I am recovering from. A big part of my recovery and self-reflection was understanding that they were parents for the first time and they protected me in the only way they knew how and they carried a lot of generational trauma as well. Again, this is not an excuse for anything that they did but this helped me get rid of a lof of resentment I was holding and form a different and better relationship with my parents as an adult.",

I reached a point in my long road of recovery where I got sick of my own rumination on things that I had no control over and are in the past.  No one has/had perfect parents. I was lucky that I had a halfway decent mom, but even she had her own traumas that she survived and lived in a world that still labeled women with \"hysteria\" and prescribed diet pills (amphetamines) and Valium.  Did she pass along some of her less than healthy coping mechanisms, yep.  Am I blaming her (or my narcissist bio-dad or emotionally unavailable step-dad), not any more.  Am I trying to do better with my kids? You betcha. Are they going to talk about me in therapy someday, I almost guarantee it.  The long and short of it, I decided to embrace my past, forgive, and remind myself to move on from it everyday.  At some point, I decided I was  sick of hearing myself complain on and on like a victim.  Do I still have bad days and wish I had perfect sit-com parents? Yep.  The difference for me now, I choose not to wallow in that.  Pain is inevitable. Suffering is optional.",

I haven't even been on here for a month, and two of my posts are already more than half-downvoted (I don't vote on my own posts).  The first one was because I asked some admittedly bad questions about why math is even necessary, on r/math no less (almost 80% downvoted).  The second one on r/lgbt (almost 60% downvoted), I'm not sure what happened.  I just asked the community what their LGBT Mario headcanons are and shared a few of my own.\n\nI know people say being downvoted isn't really that big a deal, but it always gives me a sense of \"What did I do?  Was it that bad?  Do I suck as a human being?\" and I can't stop thinking about it for a while.\n\nAt least on my r/math post, people explained why they downvoted (and I understand why and just how important math really is!), but no one told me why my r/lgbt post was downvoted.  I always wonder if it should be obvious, but I honestly don't know what I did.\n\nIt makes me scared of saying anything at all, no matter how helpful I know it is.  I just want to know what I did and how I can make it up to you.  I hate living in constant fear of saying the wrong thing and having everyone abandon me without explanation.\n\nI know my thoughts are probably incoherent right now.  I'm sorry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EDIT**: As per a comment's request, I'm taking a break from Reddit until I can figure out why I'm so scared of this.  I have therapy on March 5, so I should be back then at the earliest.",

Sometimes I have a sore throat more on the left side, sometimes it will be super dry and raw feeling, sometimes I will get rashes in my throat, constant mucus, and post nasal drip causing irritation and hoarseness, sometimes both sides of my throat will be sore, etc. It gets so painful sometimes I cry. I have also noticed now when I get just a common cold or a sinus infection, more throat hurts 10 times as bad as it used to.\r  \n\r  \nI have seen countless ENTs and other doctors. I got a Tonsillectomy in November of 2022 to try and help and I didn't see any improvement after. My infectious disease doctor ruled out any infection and autoimmune, I got an EGD done and it didn't show any signs of acid reflux, CT scan of neck didn't show anything, and I did get allergy testing done and I am highly allergic to grasses, pollen, and dust mites.\r  \n\r  \nI am thinking about starting allergy immunotherapy because I am desperate at this point just to find something that will help a little, but my allergist thinks there is a 50/50 chance it will help me as it may not be allergy-related. But, I do not know what else could be causing it. Please let me know if you have any advice! Thank you! \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo you think this could be anxiety related/has anyone else experienced this?",

                "body": "Hey there! \nI think it is important for me to say that most medication for mental health will have some pretty rough side effects (for most people, not all) for the first sorta week, they'll ease off and then maybe still a bit rocky until the 2 week mark. But that is a small toll to pay for how they're gonna make you feel in the longer term. Not everybody gets side effects after those two weeks either, and usually, they're manageable. And you can always go back and ask for a review, etc. Meds aren't one size fits all, unfortunately. My advice is to give it a go.",

I hate not knowing what's the plan for the day and it makes things harder. I try to just go with it but it doesn't sooth anything. I'm scared of messing up, or getting fired even though I don't think I'm going to do anything to get fired and even if I were to be let go it wouldn't be the end of the world I can find another job, but I feel like I'd be letting everyone down. I don't want this particular job all that much and I'm still applying to others. But I need to just figure out how to calm the anxiety and maybe things won't seem so bad. It doesn't help that I'm doing crossover to new meds from my old ones (for anxiety and depression) so that's not helping I don't think either. I'm just freaking out real bad. I don't even have a reprise when I go home because Im thinking about going back in. Ive been thinking that way for 3 days since I got the call (I didn't know I could ask for time to consider the offer, so I accepted on the spot), and it's been really attacking me inside, and is affecting my sleep more than normal. \n\nHow do you guys do it? How do you push through the anxiety? Should I mention it to my supervisors/managers? I don't know what to do. ",

        "body": "(TW: Venting, Self-Criticism, Death)\n\nHello everyone,\n\nI hope you're all doing well. I'm new to posting here and English is not my native language, but I couldn't keep this to myself any longer. I (19) have lately been dealing with a whirlwind of emotions and stress that's been incredibly overwhelming. It feels like a rollercoaster\u2014I'll be okay one moment and then completely not the next. Since November, I've been grappling with anxiety and started to get many scary physical symptoms. I don't want to burden my Family with my constant need for comfort and assurance as we are all very busy. It gotten worse that I had to take a break from college, which, honestly, made me feel like a failure. I don't know if I should even continue being a nurse due to this crippling anxiety. It's so silly that I want to be a nurse yet I can't be strong and feeling immensely weak when I'll be preparing for a job to help people get stronger and be positive.\n\nThings started looking up in late January and February, but the other day, I experienced intense dizziness that made me feel floaty and like on a boat out on a stormy day, I cried so so much and was hyperventilating a bit that my Father asked me if I want to be taken to the hospital which I declined because I don't want to. It reignited this cycle of anxiety that's been haunting me until now and made me think again about the past, and the death of my mother due to an illness.\n\nI try to distract myself by helping with our coffee shop and baking. I was in the middle of baking donuts today. A bit stressed because I was in a hurry and my really young sibling wouldn't cooperate I was feeling pressured when I noticed the recurring strange tension in my right temple and right head, along with tingling sensations and a heaviness in my forehead and cheeks. Sometimes, it even feels numb, though I can't tell if it's real or just my mind playing tricks on me. I'm exhausted and feeling really down because it keeps bothering my mind. Even my back is throbbing and tingling, adding to the confusion of what's happening to me. It made me want to burst crying but I kept my composure as to finish my tasks.\n\nI do receive many advices and comfort, which I truly appreciate, but it's still a struggle to find my footing and feel okay again. I keep listening to words of advice and ignore the symptoms, but it's hard to be normal anymore, and we don't also have money for me to get therapy or take meds. It's not that I don't appreciate my loved ones' guidance but I just want other people who actually go through the same situation as me to tell me that I'm normal. I'll be okay and it's just my mind, that I'm not stupid or crazy, and I am just emotionally unstable right now. I'm hoping to hear responses to help me keep going and to improve my whole self. I'm just really lost right now.\n\nThank you for reading this and giving your time. I pray and hope will all soon be okay.\n\nTL;DR: I'm a 19-year-old struggling with overwhelming anxiety since November, which forced me to take a break from college. Despite some improvement, recent intense dizziness triggered a relapse. Getting symptoms like tension, tingling, and numbness in my head, face and back. I'm trying to cope by staying busy, but it's tough. I can't afford therapy or medication, and while I appreciate my family's support, I crave reassurance from others who understand. I just want to feel normal again. Any advice or encouragement would mean a lot. Thanks for listening.",

                "body": "I love it. I am diagnosed GAD & MDD. GAD is my personal primary concern though and my MDD symptoms I believe are highly tied to my GAD though as most of them are more about motivation/focus issues rather than low mood issues. Don't necessarily think I have ADHD, but I do think a lot of my depression symptoms closely resemble some type of combined or predominantly inattentive ADHD symptoms.\n\nI am on 100mg SR twice a day. May bump up to total of 300mg SR though.\n\nAs a note, I do also take buspirone. However, this combo has done amazing things to calm my mind, allow me to roll with the punches, increased my motivation, my focus, my energy to participate in my environment and with other people (probably as my brain is not racing/I am not hyper-focused on thoughts in my head or worry), reduced things like irritability, and reduced even bouts of acute anxiety (like social, health, work, performance, medical appointment related, etc).  Sex drive is up and so is my interest just in overall physical affection, as well as my emotional intimacy and openness. My spouse has positively noticed the changes as well. \n\nI honestly just wake up feeling much calmer and more positive every day; I used to kind of dread the day as I started, would spend my morning workouts stressing or worrying, because I just knew I was going to head into a day full of anxiety that would create it's own cycle (as one example: too anxious to get started on a work thing I was dreading, and then I would feel anxious I was not doing it/falling behind, then I would be anxious when I got home after work as I had not started or got far into what I needed to do and would not be able to switch to personal time mode, wash and repeat). Now I just am either calm or excited and motivated to get going, feel confident I can roll with things, and leave work feeling productive and satisfied and able to enjoy my personal time (to keep it in same sort of example). \n\nOnly side effects were a bit of headache initially and some initial increased insomnia (I already have some of that, hence the SR rather than XL), but I just adjusted taking my second dose earlier and that seems to have been effective. I have not noticed any issues like brain fog etc - I actually have more clarity without the racing mind!\n\nGood luck, I hope it works for you. You can also try posting on the Wellbutrin or bupropion subs if you have questions!",

What gives me anxiety is reading all those people making generalisation from personal experience (not just here but in other threads as well)\n I would tell you the best thing to do is to try it for yourself and not read other anecdotal experiences.

I often lose weight that I shouldn't be losing, but what has helped was not forcing myself to have meals per se. Instead, I just make sure I have the easiest/most low maintenance food on hand at any time. Because even drinking an Ensure shake for some calories and protein is better than eating nothing because you have no energy. I usually stock up on Ensure shakes, frozen pizzas, microwaveable meals, cereal. I know that it's harder if you have a partner though, if he has a certain expectation of what meals should look like. Maybe you could just \"cook\" a couple meals a week and make them a frozen lasagna or something else that won't take time or planning.",

        "body": "Hi all, I\u2019m traveling internationally to a very friendly country to travel around and go hiking. I can already feel my social anxiety creeping in and looking for advice. \n\n\n\nI have a problem engaging in situations when I don\u2019t know the \u2018protocol\u2019 or what to expect. It\u2019s greatly exacerbated when I\u2019m alone. I feel exposed and like an imposter. At times the feeling is great enough that I\u2019ll back out of whatever I was going to do (get coffee, shop at a store, go on a hike, etc). Sometimes it feels like everything in the world is for everyone else but not for me, especially in a new place. \n\n\n\nOn this trip I\u2019ll be staying in a group hut one night on a hiking trail. I\u2019ve never done that before and I\u2019m petrified. Where\u2019s the door? How do I find an empty bunk? What if groups of strangers are all hanging out together but I\u2019m off in the corner like a weirdo? What\u2019s the etiquette? I\u2019m already thinking of no cook meals I can bring because I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll do something \u2018wrong\u2019 using the kitchen.\n\n\n\nI know I likely won\u2019t get answers to these specific questions (although if anyone has experience here PLEASE give me any information you can, it helps a lot) but I would love to know how you all overcome being in new spaces alone and stop othering yourself? On this trip I\u2019d really like to feel like I am allowed to exist in the world. \n\n\n\nI have a small prescription for Xanax although I mostly use it for panic attacks, does anyone have experience using it for acute social situations? Also for reference I\u2019m AuDHD which definitely doesn\u2019t help",

For months I could cry and let out my emotions and it always felt very cathartic like I really needed to let it out. As of January I can\u2019t really cry, I\u2019m EXTREMELY anxious and having panic attacks and depersonalization/derealization moments. I did recently start going to therapy and going to the gym and I\u2019m hoping that may help. But I\u2019m just feeling so frustrated and trapped? If that makes sense. I just feel like I need to release these emotions. \n\nMy next step is seeing a psychiatrist and maybe get on meds because idk what to do. :( It\u2019s really affecting my day to day life. \n\nIf anyone has experienced something similar I\u2019d love to know what has helped you.

My eyes started welling up and i was desperately trying not to cry. my teacher noticed and asked me to step outside. She asked if I was ok, and said i could do extra work instead and i gladly excepted. The only other time a teacher has been slightly mad at me, I didn't know the deadline for a big project was in a week and my English teacher said he'd said it enough times, I should have known. Again I started crying and he came over at the end of class. I physically cannot stop myself from crying when a teacher is slightly, mildly disappointed or mad or I did something wrong.

In the end you got a compromise or milder punishment.\n\nSince it's something you don't feel comfortable with, I think you should look at the thoughts that prevent you from owning up to your mistakes.  \nYou are an individual that has learned certain patterns and behaviours that helped you to get to the point where you are now, whithout dying.  \nConcering life itself and the inner workings of our mind and body, that's the whole purpose.\n\nThe mechanisms that helped us deal with the circumstances of our childhood and youth can end up being counterproductive when we reach our adulthood.\n\nIn a way it feels a lot like something I have and am still struggling with:  \nTo think that failure means I failed as a person.  \nThat it's a character flaw, that it's because I am lazy and dumb, a worthless individual.\n\nFeel free to browse through my comments, maybe something resonates with you.",

I love lawn care and it's one of my passions, but this anxiety needs to chill out. Just for context, the yard I did yesterday I didn't take a good look at when I quoted. (My fault and nobody else's but mine.) There was A LOT more than I anticipated and it really threw me in for a loop. But I did eventually get done with it and it looks pretty damn good with what I did and turns out the people absolutely loved the work I did for them. I don't know why this is stressing me out so much, maybe I'm just scared that I didn't look at this yard good neither? And maybe it will be an all day, anxiety infested day? Or will it be not as bad that I'm making it out to be? If anybody has read all this, I'm sorry for wasting your time. I just needed to write it out somewhere and thought this is a good place to do it. And maybe somebody has had an experience kinda like this they would like to share? I'm all ears.",

Not forgetting to mention my body FEELS and almost hopes to see him again, at a red light. At a club. At the store.

All logic and planning and no open emotion.\n\nI've had a few issues with my blood pressure recent, on medication to sort it and generally feeling better and on a successful health kick.\nBut I notice that whenever I get a twinge or anything in my chest.

What would my loved ones think? \n\nI never thought I had \"negative thinking\" and I suspect its because its been hidden as pragmatic and planning. Its not. Its negitive and its spirals me. \nSo I'm hoping other people will be able to help me at this point. I've recognised the trigger which is self perpetuating.\n\nHow do I interupt that?",

It is the first time that we have gone through the whole procedure in my school of putting bags outside, going in the rooms etc. \n\nWhat i have noticed is that i have suffered strong anxiety during them. I think i did well in the exams, i knew my information and worked hard etc. So i don\u2019t know why this is. Some main things I have noticed include: random moments of panic where i convince myself that my heart will stop, panic where i remember where I am and what i\u2019m doing, difficulty breathing, feeling like i am falling, and panic when a consistent noise stops (i use a computer in my exams, so for example when everyone was to stop typing at once creating a quieter sound, that causes extreme panic).\n\nOf course these are mocks so it doesn\u2019t matter too much in regards to my overall performance. However this is worrying to me as my exams are not too far away (mid May).\n\nAny advice would be very helpful. Also, I don\u2019t think i can get a doctors help with medication as i am 17yrs and don\u2019t turn 18 until some weeks after my exam. ",

        "body": "Hi guys, I don\u2019t really know how to word this. This is my first post and I guess I just wanted to be heard about this issue. \n\nMy whole life I have suffered from anxiety. My earliest childhood memory was a panic attack. I used to pass out during middle school social interactions and into high school I was heavily introverted. I always assumed I was anxious because of the sexual trauma that occurred when I was a child so I just dealt with it. It got a bit better, but throughout my whole life I was always anxious and sick. I would get muscle spasms and I would get randomly numb. Some days I would just almost pass out, but rescue myself with a banana. I grew up with a bipolar mom (undiagnosed) that never believed in mental illnesses and that I was just weak in the mind. So, I did what all young unheard kids do and just kept it inside. \n\nNow, I\u2019m in my mid twenties and back home after escaping. I\u2019ve been to the hospital 5 times within the last 4 months. After 7 doctors telling me it\u2019s just my anxiety and overworking myself. I am now told\u2026 I have a 1 in 400,000 rare genetic kidney disease. Literally today. Also, I might of had it when I was a baby. Also also, it could be contributing to my anxiety and I could\u2019ve died multiple times. \n\nI don\u2019t know how to process anything. My anxiety is so fragile right now. I don\u2019t know if anyone else with rare diseases or just any know that same feeling. Bouncing with anxiety their whole life only to be told it was their body telling them something is wrong.\n I am spiraling and I don\u2019t know how to make my mind stop. How do you keep yourself together when you find out you have lived your whole life with an unknown disease? I keep triggering myself and then it triggers my disease that sends my body out of whack. \nI have a therapist, but I guess I just want to know I am not alone in this. Because this is terrifying. I feel like I\u2019ve lost the little freedom I have left and it\u2019s to my own body. \n",

Then one day I had a panic attack from it. After that I remember it always making me anxious and panicky. I think it\u2019s been about 2-3 years since I\u2019ve smoked. I believe when you have such a traumatic experience with it you don\u2019t really go into it with any good thoughts. You smoke and your mind instantly goes \u201comg is it going to happen again\u201d so in return you start to panic. It\u2019s mostly a mental block. You have to go into it with good thoughts. Once you start to panic over it, it\u2019s going to ruin your high. I just quit because I figured it wasn\u2019t worth putting myself through more stress. I would say if you were going to continue to smoke keep it to very small amounts, know your limits. And when your mind starts to act up. Get up, take a walk, drink some water. Get some fresh air. Hope you get to enjoy it again! I know I miss it sometimes, but mental health is more important than anything!",

However, some individuals may have lower levels of anxiety or may not experience anxiety as frequently or intensely due to a variety of factors such as genetics, upbringing, coping mechanisms, and environmental influences. Additionally, practicing healthy lifestyle habits, engaging in stress-reducing activities, seeking support from loved ones, and learning effective coping strategies can help mitigate anxiety symptoms for some people. However, it's essential to remember that everyone's experience with anxiety is unique, and seeking professional support from a mental health provider can be beneficial for those struggling with anxiety.",

Truth is, it turns *into* a disorder when we start using maladaptive techniques like avoidance, causing our limbic system to fire off the fight-or-flight response whenever we do try to do something we usually avoid, hence the whole disorder part. So, people without anxiety disorders simply just deal with their anxiety in a way that doesn't cause their limbic system to fire off like that. \n\nIf it makes you feel better, we'd be AMAZING in a zombie, post-apocalyptic situation. We already got that adrenaline in our system all the time, might as well use it then right?",

I always recommend you limit intake slowly, one time I took a hit of a cart, didn\u2019t feel it after a minute so took a few more, Did 3 more cuz i still couldn\u2019t feel it, ended up triggering a giant panick attack.

I have been struggling so badly and been reaching out to Reddit in order to make me feel some comfort. We often feel so alone and isolated when going through these hard times. People look at us like we are crazy if they\u2019ve never dealt with an anxiety disorder, OCD, or depression. As I go through this terribly hard time in my life, I\u2019m here to remind all of you, if you are dealing with this, we will get through it. \n\nThe debilitating thoughts and feelings will fade. I come on Reddit to explore other people like me because like I said sometimes I feel so alone and feel like I am going crazy. Being at the doctors, hospitals numerous times. Getting answers like \u201cyou look great, go home it\u2019s anxiety.\u201d But for some reason it\u2019s not enough reassurance.. you are still searching for what could possibly be wrong with you.. You forget how to trust your body and you let your brain take hold. I NEVER wanted to become a part of anxiety and in these past few months, anxiety has become me.. it\u2019s no longer just a part, it\u2019s all of me. I\u2019m here to get out of this, I want to have a place where people can come and feel safe and just talk. I want us to all feel like we belong and just because we don\u2019t feel \u201cnormal\u201d doesn\u2019t mean we won\u2019t ever feel normal again. Don\u2019t set a time for yourself to \u201cfeel better.\u201d Give yourself and your body time.. sit in your anxious thoughts.. do what you need to do to get better even though it seems so difficult right now. \n\nI have had so many physical symptoms in the last months and each week they seem to change after I have just gotten over the last one. From headaches to twitches.. I mean literally EVERYTHING. I want this to be a place where people can come and post their symptoms or just talk about how they are feeling today.. it\u2019s so nice to have people to relate to even if it\u2019s not something fun to deal with. I write this with ALL of the love in the world. For each and every person going through this.. I want you to know we are going to get through this together.. anxiety will always be there but that\u2019s ok.. I hope everyone can find their happiness and maybe help me find a little bit of mine again \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffd",

I've suffered from health anxiety for about almost 10 months now, it all started when my dog died.I've never been concerned about my health and i've never had any health issue before. I started googling things i used to think because they were kind of odd for me like \" is it normal to make fake scenarios in your head\" and so on. Then i found that that was a mental issue and started worrying , but its not the only case. For the first part of this \"journey\" i was scared of mental condition like schizofrenia, ocd, psychosis etcetera. Then I started focusing on physical condition, i've had obsessive thoughts about heart attack , ictus , aneurysm , and anxiety was making me having every symptom, the more i searched the more i was feeling those sensation in my body.\n\nAfter 5-6 months of constant anxiety 24/7 It felt like it was finally over , but it wasn't. I started to get anxiety every other day. There were \"and still are\" 2 or 3 days where anxiety was at its lowest point i could barely feel it , and others where it was at some level that i've never expirienced before , it actually felt like i was going crazy.\n\nRight now what i constantly think about is \"Do I have tourette\" because i've always had nervous tic but with anxiety they really disturb me , maybe because i keep thinking about it . I'm not saying they are intense, i feel the need to do it , it's not in an involutary way i know i'm doing that.\n\nSorry for the long post. I never found someone who talk about health anxiety with mental conditions fears.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

And low tolerance of uncertaitny creates the need to keep doing it. Also this way it gets worse with time. But if you stop with that and just text with no going back, it'll be uncomfortable at first, but you slowly become more and more comfortable with uncertainty the longer you keep this approach, resulting in this need for reassurance and overthinking to stop.",

I faced so much cruelty growing up. I didn't get to feel loved. I didn't get to give love. Not at least until i was 12. I Don't hold grudges on the world. I Don't like to hurt people.

So as long as she wasn\u2019t ovulating you\u2019ll be good most likely. \n\nAnd you used an unbroken condom AND buying a plan b? Pretty thorough. My friend isn\u2019t on birth control and her man\u2019s literally nuts in her & she doesn\u2019t get pregnant. (She has pcos tho so that might be why) \n\nHaving sex should be like the most fun thing ever and should have u relaxed afterwards, I\u2019m sorry you don\u2019t feel that way after. Birth control is the best thing and if u have a partner maybe consider that with her. \n\nAND I JUST READ U DIDNT EVEN CUM IN HER! wow yeah no stress should be needed. And, if you rlly are that stressed about it, all you have to do is wait until she gets her period which will be within the next 28 days. So this anxiety thankfully is temporary, and I hope u don\u2019t have to deal with that stress again.",

Luckily I worked from home, so this wasn\u2019t too big of a problem at first, UNTIL I stopped even being able to be in a car which lead to me never leaving my house. For a whole year, I maybe left my house 5-10 times. Most of these being doctor\u2019s appointments, or to my moms. My partner was really supportive, but this stunted me in a way because I never had to go anywhere or do anything, so it just got worse and worse. By the end of last year, I was feeling so sick everyday and just wanted to be normal. I started walking outside my house, as far down the street as I could. Then I started going with my partner to the gas station up the road, then running in by myself. Then the grocery store and so on so forth. I still can\u2019t go anywhere alone, I still haven\u2019t been able to drive but those are my next goals. I can\u2019t give you actual advice, because I\u2019m in the same boat, BUT just do it! Just go! Just be anxious! What\u2019s really helped me was someone telling me \u201cthere\u2019s plenty of times in life you\u2019re uncomfortable. When your sick, when your talking to someone annoying, on the first day of school, ect.\u201d It\u2019s okay to be uncomfortable and being anxious is just one of those uncomfortable times! Be anxious but do it anyways. Trick yourself and then eventually you\u2019ll believe that it\u2019s all going to be okay.",

I can leave the house but I cannot go outside by my own feet (irrational thoughts).\nSomething that helps me a lot Is try identify those thoughts that make you anxious, and let them go.\nIt's like \"ohh, I have this thoughts\". That Is how I feel It can't \"hurt\" me and reduces my symptoms.\n\nTry yo go outside, no m\u00e1ster ir you do any progress, just go outside AND after few weeks, the feelings AND thoughts ar\u00e9 going to dissapear eventually.",

        "body": "Figured, I'm struggling at the moment and would share my story, maybe it will help... Maybe it will depress people. Who knows.\n\nI was in the 4th grade when I was diagnosed with ADHD, was on Adderall for may years, all through elementary and middle school. Once i began high school however i stopped as it wasn't as effective for me. I manged through high school fairly well. No real signs on anxiety. A few bouts of depression and feeling crappy, but that's normal in that part of life. I continued on, no problems. Occasionally feeling \"sick\" an \"uncomfortable\". I graduated and went to a vocational school. Studied massage therapy and had a wonderful time exploring holistic health and wellness, daily massages and wonderful teachers and classmates. I felt immensely supported and well liked. However after that graduation I did what anyone in that position would do, looked for work. I was let down by many places and work environments. The first was run by a coke fiend who had no clue how to run a spa and i soon left. I found another place that worked for as long as they needed me, hiring me under the lie i would be a permanent employee but was 6 weeks for another workers  maternity leave. I also struggled working in salon environment of \"mean girls\" as they all talked shit and tried to include me and pull me down with them. \n\nat 22 around 2012 i began to struggle, I started having anxiety, panic issues. It started in November at my sisters birthday dinner. We as a family were out at a restaurant and shortly through the meal, I had checked out and began to panic. I was so uncomfortable. I left and went to sit in the car. I cooled off but wanted nothing more than to go home. Once home, i was fine. But it began a horrible mess in my life. I began to panic more routinely, even simply going to a store i had been to a thousand times. target, grocery store, whatever. I couldn't do it. I talked to my doctor, she prescribed me Paxil (paroxetine) 20mg, and a temporary xanax as needed. I was doing ok on it, but through December i really struggled to just exist. That first hardcore panic attack was awful . I remember it vividly, I sat in the living room eating an apple. 3 bites in, I began to feel ill, I ran to the bathroom to vomit. Immediately the sweating, the unease, the breathlessness, the racing heart. All of it. I found myself flat on the floor calling my mom into the bathroom begging her to take me to the ER. She was wise enough to tell me \" its most likely a panic attack\" she suggested i take a xanax and I did, 20 minutes in I started to feel calm. It was a panic attack. Problem was, that's when it all went downhill. Soon after i was unable to go anywhere. I talked to my doctor again and she bumped me up from 20mg to 40mg of paxil and added a booster of wellbutrin(Buproprion) 150mg and I began to feel myself again. I started doing more and really living again. I got a solid job again working for another company that had contracts all over Minnesota working with athlete and in hotels doing massage, I was happy. in 2016, I met a man who would change my life, my now boyfriend of 8 years. I was hesitant, but dating and falling in love was damn easy. Things were going amazingly. I didn't struggle at all. Everything was so smooth. I was happy, engaging in life and all around feeling great. I manged to travel to the northern part of Minnesota to enjoy a lot with my partner. Going to Milwaukee for a show. Then to Las Vegas for my first flight and vacation without my family. Then again in the spring to a friends wedding in Georgia. It was so fun and amazing. I loved every minute with my partner and friends. My boyfriend and I had move in together into a wonderful apartment and soon adopted an adorable cat. Love was everywhere. Despite me leaving my old job because the hours were sparse and overhead was lacking. things where good. \n\n2020, my dirty 30. I was already struggling small things were starting to affect me. My partner planned a wonderful surprise birthday party with tons of friends an family and everyone had a blast. This was in June. Sadly things began to dwindle an affect me, COVID 19 and the fear surrounding everything. My mental health was in the shitter. I felt as though my meds were less and less effective. I started having worse and worse anxiety and panic attacks. I could barely function. Ever day was more and more a struggle, not only with my inability to leave the apartment but the ideas of keeping my relationship afloat, getting work in a time when everyone was unable to work anyway. It fucked me. 5 months, 5 months of being unable to leave my home, crying often, panicking daily. It was taking a had tole. I again contacted mt doctor, She suggested keeping on the wellbutrin, and started me on 20mg of lexapro. It never felt as right as the paxil. But it did something. I needed to start leaving again. Getting in the car even on 1mg of Ativan would cause panic. driving around the parking lot on 1mg of ativan would still upset me. But little by little, short trips and determination I began to leave and get going. Over the course of many months i was back to somewhat normal. 1 mg a day for going out. As i became more comfortable, i lessened the ativan. 1mg, became .5mg, and soon that became .25mg. A quarter of a pill. and then a half for sleep. It was going well. I certainly wasn't 100%. I couldn't do long trips with my partner. He went to Vegas, alone. He went to Denver, alone. He went to Philadelphia for work, alone. He went to Mexico with his family, alone. I felt horrible. Making him do those things alone. All the while he never let go and neither did I. Things started to change yet again. 2023,  My mom fell dangerously ill, and after 3 days unconscious on life support. We found she was diagnosed with stage 4 metastatic breast caner. She's not much of a fighter but it really affected everyone including me.  July . Things started to change as  we began to look for a house. Apartment living was fine for me, but not him. I was content and wanting to work and progress more and more to being in a healthy mental state. House searching was kind of fun, if not a little disappointing. Man of the homes within price range were less than ideal. Run down, needing more than cosmetic updates. The proverbial straw that broke the camels back. My partner decided that a home was a must, not just a want. A home nearby was disgusting. A man who lived there smoked inside for decades. The immediate smell of cigarette smoke was noxious. The walls yellowed and again needing more work than was desired. Behind my back my partner put in an offer after had said that was more work that i ever wanted to put into a home. I was hurt, They declined his offer and I was relieved. He went forward and put in another offer on that shit hole. Luckily, they were playing dumb games with the place. We did not get it. I was relieved but Things were not well. I couldn't leave yet again, and that's when he decided to buy another home without me even seeing it. Purchased without my knowledge. He was struggling with his own problems and that was his solution. It broke me. I couldn't even get to see the place. I struggled more and more. I finally found a great therapist i Am loving talking too. But too little too late.   Eventually moving day came. I had to come live with my parents again, a hostile an sick environment i had left years ago. worsened by my moms sickness and inability to recover. I ended up in my old bedroom that had been filled with everyone's crap and when I arrived had no space of my own. My meds (lexapro) had yet again failed me. They started causing negative side effects. Nausea, headaches, dizziness, fatigue. I didn't want to take them anymore. But as anyone who has taken ssri medications before. The withdrawals are terrible as well. My doctor has not been very responsive. Finally I was given the new prescription of Setraline 50mg. I thought that was too much and decide to take half. 25mg. And i was greeted with Mania, hyper active feelings that were awful. I also had one of the worst nights of sleep, not even ativan could touch, the rapid heartbeat I could feel in my ears and chest. I contacted my doctor yet again, only to met with \" this can sometimes unleash bi polar disorder\" of which i know i do not struggle with as this was only initiated by the medication. Not a suggestion of another. just keep on it and deal with it. I was dealing with crappy side effects and yet again same thing. Im terrified to take them again. I'm so run down and just want to give up. Emotionally, physically, mentally, spiritually drained and ready to give up. I keep fighting, but for what? everyone is always saying \"ask for help\" and I do, and get told others have things going on and are unavailable to help. Im just done. Thanks if anyone actually reads this all. <3   \n",

People can go days without eating and survive, so sleeping through the night won\u2019t hurt you. Remember our bodies are built to withstand these types of things for survival by nature. If this is a typical stressor for you I\u2019d recommend buying some cheap and easy snacks like chips or crackers to store in your dorm for nights like this so you can sleep with reassurance.\n\nAlso, having not eaten in 5 hours means you ate around 8pm which is a very normal dinner schedule. I usually eat at 5:30 or 6 and I\u2019m just fine until 9am or so the next day :)",

Not eating for 5/6 hours definitely won\u2019t do it. Your body is pretty good at regulating blood sugar. When your blood glucose levels fall, pancreatic cells secrete glucagon to raise them. You may be experiencing hunger pains, feeling trembly, maybe a little nauseous. It might be a little low, but it\u2019s almost definitely not dangerously low. Keep some snacks in your dorm room for when the late night hunger hits!",

        "body": "Idk where to start with this, so I\u2019ll start with some stuff that caused me to not consider anxiety being the source for a while. \n\nI\u2019m very light. And because I\u2019m very light, I think I\u2019m more vulnerable to things like passing out and feeling dizzy, so it\u2019s important for me to eat frequently. \n\nWhen I was 14, I passed out in class because I skipped breakfast. I\u2019ll never forget that awful, awful dizziness, and the worst was the nausea. I have awful emetophobia\u2014 diagnosed. \n\nLately, I\u2019ll get these small waves of nausea accompanied by feelings of dread and anxiety. It makes my heart palpitate, and the longer it goes on for, the more lightheaded and shaky I get. Even typing about it brings back the feeling a bit. \n\nThe reason why I\u2019m starting to think they\u2019re anxiety attacks, and not due to me not eating enough (because I\u2019ve been eating plenty), is that when I start feeling it, I worry about the nausea. \u201cWhat if I can\u2019t hold it back this time?\u201d \u201cWhat if I throw up?\u201d And the waves of nausea and uneasiness continue. \n\nIt\u2019s really hard to control. I try thinking about random things, daydreaming, breathing exercises, listening to music, but then that stupid thought just weasels its way back into my head and the horrible feeling continues. \n\nFortunately, I\u2019m incredibly stubborn and will go to insane measures to make sure I don\u2019t actually throw up or anything and haven\u2019t so far, but it\u2019s really uncomfortable and always ends in tears (initially fear and then relief when it\u2019s over) \n\nI don\u2019t know what to do about this. I have a therapist, but I would like a lot of advice at once so I have ideas, because this is terrifying. I\u2019d also like to know if this sounds like an anxiety attack. \n\nSo again, it\u2019ll start with heart palpitations, then waves of anxiety and dread that are accompanied by nausea, and the longer it goes on, the more likely I am to end it trembling and weak feeling all over. If it happens at night, sometimes I\u2019ll still feel weak and shaky the next morning ",

A symptom I have read about related to this disease is \u201ctingling in feet and hands.\u201d I convinced myself that the disease was active in my body as I started to feel this \u201ctingling/electrical-like\u201d pain. I am still not sure if it is real or not. The thing is, I have never experienced this symptom from past panic attacks. I have gotten tests and SO far things have ruled out. I am panicking because I am scared everyday I will wake up and have more present symptoms of this disease. Have you guys ever experienced an anxiety symptom you never had before? I had read a lot that anxiety can really manifest physically. I feel like my body is betraying me. ",

Ideally, you should be keeping your total caffeine intake to somewhere under 400 milligrams total. So either switch to something like Red Bull or drink only one or two energy drinks total. \n\nIf you can, it is always good to have somebody listen to your heart and tell you everything is okay. A lot of times, at your age that is enough to give you the all clear. So yeah, go get checked out and told you are fine. \n\nYour chest pains and palpitations sound like classic anxiety. Do things that you can control to make your life better. Get rest and eat healthy when you can. Cut back on the caffeine. You will be fine. \n\nDo what you can to treat the anxiety.

If you are unable to go to doctor, as others have said, cutting down on caffeine will help. When my anxiety ramps up, i forego my strong morning cup of tea and settle for something like chamomile tea if I am really craving something. It does do wonders, I must say.\n\nYou don't have to change everything overnight. Start small, ease yourself out of the power drinks and substitute it for healthier options like tea, etc. I know its nowhere near the same but with time, you will get used to it. Start trying to find something active you like to do, doesnt have to be 3 hours to the gym. Taking a walk (with a friend if you don't want to alone), swimming, yoga, etc. Even calming things like journaling, drawing, writing...\n\nI have also relied on meditation as well, it really helps you focus on yourself and not the distractions around you. You can find really good ones on sites like youtube under \"anxiety meditation\".\n\nKnow you are not alone and while we can't completely escape from what causes us anxiety, we can take steps to at the very least, minimize it and not let it take over.

        "body": "TW Cardiophobia\n\nI had an echocardiogram recently and was told I was completely healthy, but I have trace regurgitation. My doctor said it isn\u2019t worrisome, but that didn\u2019t make me feel better. She didn\u2019t mention that they found \u201cmild systolic anterior motion of the mitral chordal apparatus\u201d. I don\u2019t know what that means and there aren\u2019t many studies on this, but I found some scholarly articles that had some devastating results. I left her a message to explain it better, but it has my anxiety so elevated waiting for her to respond. \n\n I have been suffering with some serious health anxiety due to some chest pain I\u2019ve been having. Anxiety has caused some physical symptoms like tension headaches, heart palpitations, air hunger, racing heart, chest pain, etc. These have all triggered really awful panic attacks where I feel like I\u2019m having a heart attack or dying which have sent me to the ER twice. Both times I was told I was perfectly fine and healthy even though I had a scare that I might have a pulmonary embolism but it was negative. I was pretty active where I went to the gym 5 times a week and I ate really healthy before this. I had little stress too. I have always been an anxious person though but it was very manageable.\n\nThese symptoms manifested during a stressful time where I was in the middle of moving cross country and losing my job. I figured it was anxiety, but it chose to manifest as health anxiety. It has been tough to manage. I stopped working out over 3 months ago due to fear of something bad happening to me. Now, I feel paralyzed. I\u2019m afraid that I\u2019m going to drop dead. There are no known heart issues in my family. I\u2019m trying to live with this new knowledge, but my anxiety has been worse now. I was feeling better and extremely positive until these results. Now I\u2019m back to the same symptoms I had in past and I\u2019m even more afraid for my heart. \n\nI could\u2019ve chosen to live without this knowledge, but my anxiety made me want to get reassurance which I understand now that\u2019s not always a good thing.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do right now. I just want to feel better. ",

I\u2019m prepping for surgery (not related to my heart) and I had an EKG done and I read the results and it said that it\u2019s possible I had a mild heart attack (I can\u2019t remember the terminology used). I then had an appointment with the cardiologist who cleared me for surgery and acted like my EKG results are totally fine, which I guess they are since he\u2019s the expert. Anyway, prior to this, I\u2019ve had 24/7 heart palpitations for the better part of a year. Again, the cardiologist didn\u2019t seem concerned. Said it\u2019s most likely my anxiety or perimenopause. So I went to my PCP and explained everything and she said I would never be cleared for surgery if there was a concern for my heart. That they\u2019re in the business of making money and would\u2019ve been more than happy to send me off for more testing. So now I\u2019m over here ready to get surgery in a month and worried I\u2019m going to die on the table because I have some undiagnosed heart issue. Idk what to do. \n\nSo yeah the cardio phobia is real. I feel the pain you\u2019re going through. It\u2019s awful and I have panic attacks and cry all the time. My husband tells me I can\u2019t control the future and whatever will be will be and I\u2019m just like what.

I lost my uncle a few years back to alcohol poisoning. The danger of over consumption and alcohol dependence is understated as most cultures glamorize it. That being said-\n\nAlcohol making anxiety worse isn\u2019t something I\u2019ve heard of before since it\u2019s a \u2018depressant\u2019 but I suppose everyone reacts differently to everything.\n\nIf you can find a way to manage your anxiety outside of drinking it would likely help when drinking as well. You have to face the problem head on. In all likelihood what\u2019s making you anxious when you drink is you\u2019re becoming inhibited and whatever mental blockades are keeping your anxiety at bay are coming down. \n\nBest of luck",

It\u2019s sometimes helpful to know that it\u2019s just your body trying to protect you (albeit from something it doesn\u2019t need to!) so try and work with it and sit with the feeling if it comes on again and repeat back to yourself that you\u2019re safe and you understand where the thoughts are coming from. Try and get outside in fresh air when it happens too as I find nature helps calm things quicker.\n\nI can see that you\u2019re on antidepressants which I first started taking for panic attacks, they made my symptoms worse for a couple of weeks but then slowly without me even noticing helped them subside. Eventually each day I felt more in control of the feelings and could talk myself down from the attacks before they came on until they subsided completely, so please know it can be treated. \n\nWhen I first started experiencing panic attacks (and they still get me occasionally) it\u2019s so worrying and feels so dangerous, but as I said at the start it\u2019s simply your body responding to a potential threat (thought) and getting into fight or flight. Racing thoughts, fast heart beat, needing to escape. Re-teach yourself that you\u2019re safe and secure. A technique I learnt is taking yourself away and jogging on the spot, your body feels that it\u2019s running from the threat and eventually calms down. (You won\u2019t always need to do that, but it helps if nothing else). \n\nYou\u2019re not alone and I hope this helps x",

It\u2019s been about four days. No fever, no nausea, no diarrhea. But when I press and release I feel pain. Does anyone else experience this? It feels like a huge gas bubble needs to pop but never does. I don\u2019t want to to the ER and waster their home if nothing is wrong ",

She commutes a lot during the week, so I get it.  Wants a break.  But, I hate driving.  Can't stress that enough.  And I've got a nice car.  Don't care.

I got my license at 20 but driving by myself has seemed impossible (a driving test is very different from real life driving). I had to start commuting to a neighboring town for work and I would have struggled with the bus for another year but my grandmother on my dad\u2019s side (we are not close with his family) left me her car in her will. My parents believed in me, fixed the car and drove it to me and somehow, by some miracle I started driving to work. I have a long way to go, every new place is very anxiety inducing and I have been avoiding highways, I don\u2019t do them alone. I only drove the backroads way to work, never strayed from that route. Now I don\u2019t have to drive to work because it\u2019s walking distance, but I\u2019m trying to keep the driving up. If anyone (preferably someone who understands what I\u2019m going through) can give me any tips for starting to drive highways I\u2019d really appreciate it. I\u2019m trying to be able to drive to my friends house in another neighboring town in which I have to get to via highway, because I feel like they resent me because they always have to come get me if they invite me over.",

I can drive and have since 15, got my license and a car at 16.\n\nI went through a period of my life in my early 20s where I was on different antidepressants and anxiety meds. I was briefly on Abilify, and it triggered some strange anxiety around driving that persists to this day even though it\u2019s been nearly a decade since I was on the medication. In fact, I specifically live in a city where I don\u2019t have to drive and can get around in public transit. I think the medication opened my eyes to the idea that I could seriously injure someone unintentionally with my car and it\u2019s just exhausting to worry about all the things that can go wrong. Even worse is if someone is in the car with me. It\u2019s pretty awful.\n\nWe have the electric mustang in bright blue and I WISH I loved driving it lol",

                "body": "I didn\u2019t really start driving until I was around 25. Definitely because of anxiety.  \n\n\nMy sister and brother were both survivors of rollover vehicle accidents and I had this paranoia that I was next.  Which I realize this many years later is just paranoia. \n\nI rode my bike and the bus everywhere in my city at the time I first moved, and lived fairly close to a grocery store, so I didn\u2019t need to drive.  It was only when I got a job across the city that I chose to start driving.  Then when I left later and later for work I eventually needed to get on the interstate to get there in time.  I made a few beginner mistakes, but learned quickly.  You have to be hyper aware of your surroundings.  Not only for distracted drivers, but new drivers, old drivers (a dementia stricken grandmother of mine was driving completely the wrong way recently, before family took away her driving privileges), impaired drivers, and sometimes people experiencing medical emergencies at the wheel.  There\u2019s also bad weather conditions which worsen all aspects depending on how severe. \n\nLots of other people are looking at their phones.  Every day you see people make deadly decisions as well.  There are so many speeders that will cut you off dangerously only to awkwardly be right next to you at the next light. Happens all the time. Especially obvious once you start paying attention to all the cars and looking in and seeing the driver\u2019s faces.  So many jerks out there.  I\u2019m surprised there aren\u2019t more accidents.  \n\nMy father works for an injury law firm and most of their cases are vehicular accidents. Everyone sues each other out there, and people will lie, so invest in a dash cam.  I don\u2019t have recommendations, there are plenty of reviews on Amazon listings for various cams for various budgets. \n\nI\u2019ve been driving now almost fifteen years and I hate every journey.  Luckily I\u2019ve never been in an accident.  Much of that is to me paying attention. Some is pure luck, of course.  Always check your blind spots, don\u2019t drive too close to the people in front of you because you want ample reaction time if in case an accident is up ahead, and take care of your car with upkeep.  \n\nIt\u2019s anxiety inducing.  Do everything you know how to do to lessen it, or return to a more calmed state afterwards.  When I drove most was when I had a retail job and getting to the job was always nerve wracking because of the idiocy I\u2019d see on the road, which then I\u2019d get sensitive to and notice all the idiot jerk customers, which then made me want to just die every day.  All because of my anxiety.  Whereas others don\u2019t care one bit about driving or safety and just use a car to get from A to B without another thought \ud83d\ude02 Oh, anxiety, why are you all in my brain 24/7?!?!",

        "body": "I'm 24 years old and have been dealing with anxiety since I was 14. I've already given up doing some activities because of my anxiety before. At the age of 15, I stopped taking dance classes because I was anxious and I never participated in any sport at my school for the same reason. I went to the gym when I was 17, on a doctor's recommendation and I remember going to the gym crying because I was very anxious.\n\n In 2022, I started going to therapy after I started having anxiety attacks that took me to the hospital. On numerous occasions the therapist recommended that I go to the gym, with the aim of exposing myself to people and dealing with my social anxiety. It took me a while due to economic reasons (and lack of courage), but after almost two years of therapy, the psychologist considered that I was able to deal with social situations on my own.\n\n  \nThis month, I finally signed up for a gym. Yesterday was my first day. At first, just the thought of going made me quite anxious and I was scared to go. I created many scenarios in my head about how I would handle the situation. Just signing up for the gym involved contacting many people: getting in touch with instructors to find out the gym's opening hours, the cost of monthly fees, how it works, etc. After scheduling an workout, it dawned on me that I had actually signed up for a gym and had to go. I even thought about giving up, but if my psychologist believes I'm ready, then I'm ready and I tried to keep that in mind.\n\n  \nI also took some precautions, such as wearing comfortable clothes that made me feel safe and taking a t-shirt if I felt uncomfortable because I felt too exposed. But despite that, I didn't have any crisis. No shortness of breath, chest pain, stomach pain or panic attack. Today I went again and it was peaceful. So I'm very excited! I still feel awkward being in an environment with so many people, but no one pays attention to me except for the gym owner (he was my teacher in elementary school and is friends with my brothers), so that brings me comfort.",

Our marriage was arranged by our parents and families, and I love her so much. I can't stop thinking about her and taking care of her, and being the man she deserves for life and loving her. We were engaged for roughly 6 weeks after I graduated college last year in May 2023, and then the same week she graduated high school in June 2023, we were married. Now, recently, we found out that my wife is pregnant, and I am terrified! Like, where did my life go? \n\nAlso, we live with my parents, and I still live at home. I am an analyst at a large company that's a Fortune 500, making good money. My family and parents are a blessing by God, and amazing. My wife is happy and everything, but this is so fast. Also, for anyone who's wondering, yes, I was a virgin before marriage, and it just naturally happened when my wife and I were alone on our wedding night, and we began a loving sexual relationship together. Well, here we are. Also, I told my parents she's too young, and I'm too young for marriage, but since I got a degree and a good job and was established, and also she graduated high school, my wife and came from a big family of many sisters and brothers, and my father-in-law is old, now a few years short of 70, everyone thought it was a good idea for her to marry. \n\nStupidly, I told my parents last year, or well, back in 2022 when I met my then 16-year-old wife for the first time, and I was 21, that I'm gonna marry her, and that it was love at first sight because she's so beautiful, and their family is amazing and wonderful. But yeah, I didn't think they would do this. And I also said yes to the marriage because I mean, why not? Plus, my only excuse was that I'm not interested, but I had a paranoia that if I wouldn't have a wife now, maybe I never would have. What do I do? I'm not ready for a baby, and also, \n\nI'm not really even ready for marriage, but I am and I do my best to be a loving, caring man to my wife and to love her every second and always make her my first priority. But what do I do? I literally am getting anxiety attacks.",

        "body": "TW: self harm I suppose\n\nHello, I am posting here because I have something I \\*suppose\\* it is anxiety but I do not have a diagnosis, I am not looking for one here, I am seeing a physician for that in a few days. It is really hard for me to describe what I experience, I have trouble with knowing what I feel in general, so I am not sure what it is or whether it is serious or not, and I am afraid I fail to convey it to the physician and I do not feel legitimate asking for help provided that most people probably have it much worse than me. This is why I am asking you this; does it sound like something you experience too?\n\n  \nI do not have the physical symptoms commonly associated with anxiety such as shortness of breath, trembling, fast heart rate, sweating. However, I always wake up way too early (like 1 or 2 hours before the alarm), then I feel stressed and I cannot go back to sleep. I take melatonin but it doesn't solve this issue. Sometimes I feel ok, and sometimes I worry a lot, without much objective reason, but it is like having a dashboard warning light blinking constantly without knowing why. I can become very stressed about things not that important, I become very tense and irritable, then I argue with people in my head, have negative and catastrophist self talk. Since I have always been like this (I think) I can deal with it; deep down I know this feeling is just temporary but this won't make it go away. If circumstances make it worse, everything becomes unbearable, most stimulations (such as noise, or much worse, touch) become too much, I cannot really think anymore, I just want to run to hide somewhere safe to curl into a ball and scream and cry (it is really hard for me to cry because of emotional blunting, but I feel I need to and I can't, just like when you suffer from nausea but cannot puke while you really would like to). At this stage if I am alone I may kick and punch walls, or hit my hands together. As stupid as it sounds, pain has a temporary soothing effect, and bruises left by this are usually not visible (though they can hurt for days).\n\n  \nOne situation which makes me feel bad like this is when I have nothing to do, so I cannot really chill. I cannot get either why people enjoy travelling or going on vacation as it seems so stressful to me, so I cannot really think about it as a way to rest. I feel I am totally exhausted but I feel I cannot rest. I do not know whether this is normal or not, maybe most people just deal with it. Mind you, I have been on vacation alone twice, and felt okay most of the time, and I hold an executive job. However, I live my live avoiding stressful situations so I feel bad only part of the time, but there are tons of things that normal people seem to do with ease and which cost me a lot. It is very possible that I am simply too weak and too lazy and I am just looking for excuses; I really don't know; I don't know what happens to me and I don't even know whether something at all happens to me, and that uncertainty is probably wearing me down.",

Like you said, even with nothing to do you can\u2019t chill and you get tired anyway lol. Try and relax as best you can before the drs appointment and don\u2019t let yourself say your lazy or weak or whatever. You have a job, you make money to go on vacations, nothing in this posts suggests moral failings on your end being the cause of you not feeling good. \n\nAnxiety often responds well to therapy, and medication when needed. I say this as both someone who has been in treatment and on meds basically all my late adolescent and adult life and more recently as an occupational therapist working in psych. You should be confident in your ability to make progress now that you\u2019ve taken the first step to getting help!",

        "body": "Hi, everyone! First time poster here, although I have visited the subreddit on few occasions these past few months :)\n\nI have been dealing with some symptoms that may be related to anxiety, but I want to know if anyone else faced something similar, since I couldn't really find more specific info online. \n\nSo, in order to have the full picture: back in summer, I had to go to the ER due to a medical emergency. Nothing serious fortunately, but I did require surgery in order to avoid future complications. Everything went well, recovery was good, but they did tell me that they noticed something weird about my heart on the EKG and that I should get it checked.\n\nA few months pass and come November, I had some weird chest pains that lingered for a few days, then simply went away. I was instantly reminded about what they told me back in summer, and I started worrying for a bit, but figured I would get those investigations done soon and see if there is anything wrong. \n\nShortly after I started experiencing something else, and this is the central point of my post: difficulty swallowing and feeling like I am suffocating because of that. Often times whenever I was eating it was like my muscles forgot how to swallow and I would have a few moments of panic, before finally being able to swallow the food. This happens only with solid foods and spit,  but not with liquids. \n\nThings get progressively worse in December, culminating in mid January when I have a full on panic attack while working. In addition, a bunch of other weird symptoms appear until the beginning of February, such as:\n\n* tingling/numbness in my fingers and sometimes toes\n* fidgeting/twitching toes and feet\n* neck pains and a feeling of pressure in the back of my head\n* shoulder pain\n* visual snow and other sight problems\n* sudden pressure in my ears, usually followed by intense tinnitus (usually in the right one)\n\nIn the meantime I visit a doctor who recommends doing some tests, and the results are fine. My heart is also in good shape (although I need to do some exercise) and my thyroid is also fine (this was recommended due to my swallowing problem).  I have also started taking Magnesium supliments, at my doctor's recommendation. \n\nAfter seeing the results, these symptoms seem to have died down, but I still occasionally get them. I believe they may be strictly tied to anxiety, since they tend to appear  more often when I am feeling stressed, or if my mind is unoccupied.  If I am deeply focused on some other activity (like playing music or being very focused on my work tasks), I rarely (if ever) experience these symptoms.\n\nI am 99% percent sure this is just health anxiety caused by my medical episode from summer (which I do admit, has left quite a mark on me). \n\nI still need to do some tests, but I am pretty sure they will turn out fine. Nonetheless, the occasional choking sensations, or some weird feeling in my ear is enough to set me off course for a bit and make me feel like I may have a heart attack or a stroke :) \n\nI posted this because I wanted to know if others have gone through something similar, and if they can share their experience and offer some advice. \n\nThanks! :D \n\n&#x200B;",

I can\u2019t even  bring myself to self to order anything because the thought of my neighbors knowing I ordered food is so embarrassing (I\u2019m also scared of running into my neighbors)\n\nand I just dread going to work because I have to interact with hundreds of people per day and the thought just sickens me. every time I make a mistake at work I\u2019m just so close to crying and I feel so guilty even though it\u2019s never that serious. I really don\u2019t want to go and pretend I\u2019m okay for everyone else comfort. I\u2019m so tired.\n\nI just hate leaving the house. I wish I never had to.

I feel like something is going to happen and I put a hand on my chest or neck to feel my heartbeat. Partially to see if I\u2019m anxious and have a high heart rate and partly to check if I\u2019m dying. \n\nThere\u2019s no hallucinations but things seem different. Colours are more noticeable despite no vision changes. The air is noticeably static or windy. Heightened perception I guess. \n\nI don\u2019t think typical grounding techniques will work because I\u2019m already aware of my surroundings and focussing on that feels worse but I can comfort myself by reminding me I\u2019m okay, I\u2019m not going to die. I almost immediately feel better when I find out what caused it. For example I had too much caffeine the other day but didn\u2019t realise until a bit after I went into this state. It doesn\u2019t last very long. If I\u2019m in the doctors waiting room I have to actively try to not sink into it. \n\nIt feels like if it keeps going I\u2019ll freak out but I\u2019ve never actually had a full panic attack besides on a bad trip ",

It's reasonable to feel like you aren't in a place where you could raise another life, to fear for your body, your money, and your safety. Especially depending on where you live, your safety can be more compromised if you are in a place that does not uphold the safety of the pregnant person over the safety of the fetus or have social programs to help you. It's okay to be afraid of getting pregnant and you never have to if you don't want to. Im not trying to give you reasons to worry, I'm saying Ihear you and that you're not irrational. Sometimes for me it can help my anxiety for someone to just say they hear me, understand me, andbthat I'm not crazy for feeling a certain way. I hope you have someone you can talk to in your life about this who understands.",

However last may I started to experience these intense episodes of Deja vu.  They lasted about 4-10 seconds.  And I started to freak out about temporal lobe epilepsy.  Fast forward almost a year and I now can\u2019t go an hour without getting one.  I have seen two neurologists, both have said that they think I\u2019m fine, I have had an eeg run, and it came back clean.  And I ALSO talked to my family doctor who happens to also have a masters in neurology, so she knows a thing or two, and she ALSO said I\u2019m probably fine.  But I can\u2019t help but panic.  I have never experienced Deja vu before and now I\u2019m suddenly experiencing it.  I\u2019m terrified, just waiting to drop into a seizure.  Has anyone else experienced this from just anxiety??",

                "body": "It most certainty can, thats why shows you have already watched are so comforting, you know whats going to happen. You already know who lives or dies or ends up in a relationship together. So starting a new show can definitely cause anxiety, you get attached and worried about how people will react. \n\nIm going to be a bit selfish and talk about myself for a moment. I got anxiety from watching the new Percy Jackson series. I have a personal back story for why, but I hate when people force others to do things, or to be a certain way or to live a life they would have chose for themselves. It drives me nuts, just let people live. And around episode 3, I decided to read the wikipedia on the episodes. So I did ruin it for myself but when I returned to the series, my anxiety dropped off because I knew what was going to happen. Honestly, thats what Id recommend doing. Your reading ahead, you will know if someone dies or if there is an episode clif hanger, etc. and it may help in brining down your anxiety. \n\nLong term though, you need to remember that its just a show and regardless of what you think should happen, none of it actually affects you. Something I had to keep telling myself. You are allowed to get up and walk away from a show and it will not follow you. Im not sure of exactly why/where your anxiety comes from for this, is it that its new, is it that the genres are slightly intense, is it because you identify with certain characters and they make choices you wouldnt, are you just concerned you wont like it and that you wasted your time. IDK, you gotta find that one out to really be able to move on from this. Trust, as someone whos anxiety is going down and nearly non-existent, finding out where your anxiety comes from helps make it all not nearly as scary and way easier to tackle/prevent/stop.

        "body": "I've been prescribed propranolol for anxiety today and I'm debating whether or not I should take it for a concert I'm going to tonight. I'd love for something to help with the anxiety I get at shows, but I am absolutely horrified of feeling nauseous or vomiting (I have really bad emetophobia). Has anyone had any issues with nausea on propranolol? Is it worth waiting to try it another time when I'm safe at home to see how my body reacts? Thanks!\n\nEdit: I've been prescribed 10mg",

I don't know where else to turn, so I thought I'd reach out here for some advice and support.\r  \n\r  \nSo, here's the deal. I've been struggling with addiction for a while now, and it's gotten to the point where I feel like I'm losing control. I've been using toad venom and fermenting grains to make moonshine, and it's taking over my life. I know it sounds crazy.\r  \n\r  \nI first got into this stuff when I was around 14, just experimenting with different things to see what would happen. I started with the toad venom because I heard it could give you a crazy high, and I wanted to see for myself. It started out as just a curiosity, but then it turned into something more.\r  \n\r  \nMy room has turned into a makeshift toad sanctuary, with multiple tanks filled with different species.\r  \n\r  \nI have to admit, I own a few toads as pets, and I've been using them to get high off of their venom. I know it's messed up, but I can't seem to stop myself. And then there's the moonshine. I started making it because I thought it would be cool to have my own homemade alcohol, but now I can't go a day without it.\r  \n\r  \nIt's affecting every aspect of my life. My grades are slipping, I'm always tired and irritable, and I can't seem to focus on anything else. I've tried to quit on my own, but it's like I'm trapped in this cycle of addiction.",

        "body": "A few years ago, i went to the hospital (and to be honest, i completely forgot the reason why). all i can remember was that they gave me medication through an IV mixed with Benadryl. shortly after administering it, it felt like i was being microwaved, and my heart rate shot up to 140. the nurse left and came back and told me that he didnt put the medication in the correct order, meaning he was supposed to administer the benadryl first, and then the other medication (possibly vice versa, i forgot which order he was supposed to give it to me). in the end he gave me a sedative to calm me down, and ever since that day i\u2019ve been nervous about having an IV.\n\nafter that incident, it took me a long time to become okay with them even pushing saline. i would become nervous, because i could feel the cold saline through my veins, but after a few hospital trips, i became okay with saline.\n\na few weeks ago i went to the ER because of a tension headache that would not go away. the nurse gave me an IV and said she was going to give me toradol, reglan, and benadryl. i started to get anxious when she said benadryl, because i kept thinking about what happened a few years ago. when i told her what happened she looked at me like i was crazy, or like shes never heard of anything like that before. she said she would administer the medication slowly, and i agreed. i didnt watch her push the medication through, because i knew if i did watch her i would just freak myself out. however while she was pushing the medications i started to hyperventilate and my body had a reaction. it felt like my chest was sinking and i felt extremely nauseous, and i had an anxiety attack. it took my about 30 minutes to calm down, and i became drowsy due to the benadryl.\n\nbasically my question is, could this have been some sort of reaction from the benadryl? it seems to be the common denominator here and i don\u2019t believe ive ever taken benadryl unless it was given to me in the hospital both of those times. it just seems so silly to me that something as simple as benadryl could cause this, so maybe its all in my head? has this ever happened to anyone else before?",

        "timestamp": "2024-02-29 13:15:37",
        "body": "My girlfriend suffers from anxiety, depression, bipolar, and BPD. We both also thinks she has ADHD. We are both 27 y/o and I am a Male. We have been moved in together after the first 4 months.\n\nI don't have any mental illnesses that I know of, other than anxiety under specific stressful situations. I mainly have health anxiety.\n\nWe have been together for about a year a half. One thing I noticed that has always stayed consistent is throughout each day and every day, she always talks about herself and her issues, and depending on which topic, how strong she is for over coming certain issues. I used to talk a lot, but I have noticed over the last number of months, I have become introverted because many conversations are always about her and if I do speak it results in more anxiety and negativity directed at me. To be honest, it's not only when she vents. Her responses more often then not are passive aggressive or negative.\n\nThere are a few problems I have. From the first few minutes I wake up each day, I am always greeted with some issue that she faced the day before or a consistent issue that she had been facing from the past. And it's almost like the second we wake up, she just HAS to vent about said issue again, even if it's already been talked about multiple times. And said issue, will consistently come up throughout the day and into the night when I get home. And she really shows her emotions, so it's not always a \"calm\" venting session, it's often anger and negativity. And almost always results in getting worse when I speak, whether it's a response to help or a \"honest truth\" type of an answer.\n\nTo be perfectly honest, I feel that we almost never have any conversations that are relative to me or my own thoughts, or work days, or even conversations that directly reflect both of us together as a couple. Each conversation we have is almost always about her. It irritates me because I would like to wake up without any negativity right off the bat, and same thing when I come home. The last thing I want, specifically after listening to negativity from her all day and work stress, is to engage even further into negative conversations about the same thing that she has not let go of, when I get home from work. It bothers me because often her negative energy about whatever she has going on, causes me massive anxiety because of the fact that she's putting off that energy. Like even though it's her venting about her issues, I take her emotions so personally. And I don't know how not to.\n\nI have tried speaking about it in the past, and it has often resulted in her saying things like, \"well f*** me then I'll just stop talking to you\" or \"I guess I can't talk to my boyfriend about anything\" or things related to that. Very often her way of \"communicating\" causes fights, because it's always filled with negativity and anger that's directed at me. Her response to this is that \"her anger isn't directed at me, it's only because I'm the only one she has to talk to, so I receive those emotions\" I honestly try my best to stay calm but those types of responses almost every time trigger my anger and make me respond negatively. I hate that it affects me like that. But I'm not sure what else to do, how am I supposed to respond to negative emotions that I know result in increased anxiety and stress for me? Our relationship is holding on by threads because of the way she reacts and talks to me. How do I stop taking her venting emotionally all the time so personally? How do I allow myself to be okay with the fact she talks about her self so much?\n\n\n**EDIT: The issues she vents about pertain to her work issues, the family issues she has, or just about any other issue under the sun that has to do with her. The issues she vents about are not related to me or us as a couple**",

So number one thing in a relationship is to **communicate with the significant other!** Sit her down, communicated your feelings instead of posting it on Reddit. If she can\u2019t be civilized and talk things through, then the relationship isn\u2019t very healthy. \n\nNumber 2, she might just feel unheard. A lot of people with those kind of overwhelming mental issues feel like they can\u2019t correctly communicate the pain they feel. Venting and you allowing her to vent might be what\u2019s keeping her on her feet. That said, boundaries are extremely important. And they will be your best friend in this situation. \n\nI will say it straightforward, this does not sound like a healthy relationship. \n\nPlease sit her down and communicate with her the best you can. Tell her that you feel like she\u2019s always talking about herself and that you don\u2019t essentially appreciate it. COMMUNICATE. Don\u2019t post on Reddit about it. There\u2019s a chance she could see it as well.\n\nI wish you the best of luck, OP. I sincerely hope you guys can work this out! \u2764\ufe0f",

Her responses to that are that she has no one else to talk to, and that she has bipolar so she can't help it and I have to deal with it. Sometimes she will honestly say \"well f*** me then I guess I won't talk to you about anything anymore\". Things along those lines. The hardest part is trying to get her to realize that it's how she speaks to me and the consistency of that is what affects me. If she could speak calmly and collectively towards me and engage in conversation that doesn't always result in aggression than everything would be different. That's how she used to be for the first 4-6 months, than it slowly changed. Which we talked about that also. She blames it on her \"getting comfortable\" which is why she feels she's allowed to speak however she wants"

I have no history of actual physical panic attacks until this semester, no anxious thoughts anymore, but just sudden and random physical attacks\n\nToday was my last day before spring break and I had two back to back exams. I felt confident about the material during it, but seemingly out of nowhere, 30 mins I gradually realized I had almost no feeling anywhere on my body, and I had no spacial awareness of where my limbs were at. It was only after this I started to majorly freak out and think what the fuck is this. I'd adjust my legs, and I could hardly feel anything and after I made to decision to use my muscles, it'd feel like they just kinda teleported and bumped into each other. My hand/arms/face were the same way. Couldn't feel myself grabbing my pencil or mouse until I literally watched the mouse move.                                                                  \n\nI was able to calm my heart down from the initial freak out pretty cause I knew there wasn't an actual issue, but I was just worried cause like I can't feel my goddamn limbs. I finish my test and go walk to my next one and it's like I'm playing qwop with my body, I was just lucky I had 20 years of practice walking. My next test I wasn't nervous about it, and I wasn't that tired, but I just couldn't feel anything still until like 2 hours ago. But like what the actual hell was that? I never have bad side effects from my meds, and I sleep good enough now to sustain 5 hrs a night for 5 days at a time. I've got my next pysche appointment next week, but I just want to know if this is an actual thing or I self recovered myself out of a ischemic stroke\n\n*I'm sorry about the formatting I've got no clue and it's a mess otherwise ",

                "body": "I'm currently going through the same thing. I recently upped my dose of my anxiety meds and I think that has made things a bit worse (whether the lack of appetite/nausea is a side effect or just me being worried about possible side effects is yet to be seen). But my appetite has definitely gone down over the past few months and especially this last week since starting the new dose.\n\nMy main piece of advice is to not make a big deal out of it, anxiety wants you to think that this is something catastrophic and that you'll never get your appetite back and the nausea will last forever and ever and be the worst feeling ever. A few days ago, not being able to eat all of my dinner was enough to have me panicking for hours, but today I ate about 2/3 of my dinner and just let myself sit with that and be okay with it. Either this is a side effect of the meds that will eventually wear off (or I'll just go back to my previous dose), or it's anxiety and will eventually pass.\n\nIn the meantime, try and eat small snacks throughout the day rather than bigger meals, it's much easier to digest and doesn't run the risk of blood sugar drops or spikes as much as eating three big meals a day. Don't be afraid to only eat what you deem as a safe food. I like ginger biscuits, cheese toasties and crisps. Also try and eat at least one of your five a day if you can, it'll help you more than you realise. I had peas with my dinner!\n\nThis shit is so tough and I won't lie, I've spent most of the past few days convinced it will never end. But it will eventually, even if that process is tough.

Couldn\u2019t be anything else??) and relentlessly googling all of my symptoms to be told I\u2019m dying over and over again.\n\nI mostly managed to ignore th leg pain and the chest pain now at the back of my mind didn\u2019t bother me all too much and my partner gave birth to my beautiful daughter 3 days ago via an emergency ciserean section, my doctor prescribed me some propalnol or however it\u2019s spelt and I took them before going to the hospital to help with the physical stress/anxiety of it all and despite it being a horrible time I seemingly was relatively calm during the whole process until two days ago where I came home and my throat felt completely closed and my chest had a lot of pressure on the left hand side(it\u2019s always the left?) I felt I had no choice but to go back to the A and E or ER for my Americans and sat for 15 hours waiting for another x-ray to be told everything from my bloods to my ecg to my OBS were all perfectly fine, amazing right bit I\u2019ve spent my last two nights with a racing heart and a feeling of extreme breathlessnes.\n\nI even paid today to see a cardiologist privately who re-assured me there\u2019s 0 evidence and very low risk that any of my issues are cardiac and found nothing on a physical assessment of me.\n\nSerious question guys, do you\u2019re palpitations make your heart race and feel as though it\u2019s the end of your life? I lie here in bed right now with a beating heart only slowed by meds and even when slowed a feeling of pressure on my left chest and my throat closing up just trying to make it through another night.\n\n\nIf this so what stress and anxiety can cause me I really want out or some way to cope, any advice or relatability is greatly appreciated and I send love to anyone else dealing with anxiety and stress at this level.",

        "author": "DarkPrinceCait",
        "timestamp": "2024-02-29 14:54:39",
        "body": "I\u2019m a personal injury paralegal who just recently hit 34. I\u2019ve suffered from anxiety problems since I was in elementary school, and this has spun off into full-blown death anxiety several times. I had a few episodes in high school, due to my Christian upbringing never really taking and me beginning to contemplate what death means, and then another more severe one in college. About a week ago, I started having another spiral, and it\u2019s threatening to ruin my life.\n\nI don\u2019t know what set this off, exactly. For a long time now, I\u2019ve just been focused on living day by day, either immersed in my work or my hobbies. I think some of it might be simply because of where I am in life - I have a stable job, but I\u2019ve only had this job for 3-odd years, half my income has to go into paying off my rent, and I can\u2019t afford to save or invest much. I don\u2019t have many ties to my community, and while I want a partner, I have no dating experience and am in the closet as a lesbian and planning to go in deeper at the rate America is going.\n\nLike, fuck, I remember being 13 and teasing my dad over turning 40. I\u2019ll be 40 in six years. What do I have to show for it? I spent five years caring for my mother until her death in 2017 and two years scraping by at retail while I attended night classes to get my paralegal certificate. My 20s were supposed to be the best part of my life, and they went completely down the drain. My 30s have been a lot better but... that's kind of the end of the line, isn't it?\n\nI think some of it is also just my job - I love what I do, but the fact remains that I\u2019m being exposed to stories of other people\u2019s deaths and trauma day in and day out. I thought I was compartmentalizing, but I guess I wasn\u2019t. Maybe something just spilled over.\n\nWhatever it is, I\u2019m struggling. I\u2019ve suddenly gone from eagerly hitting my pillow at night to being afraid to sleep, from loving to cook and enjoy food to not enjoying any bite of food or any sip of water, and from throwing myself into my hobbies to feeling apathetic about them. I used to be super passionate about my job, and now it\u2019s a chore to do anything. What\u2019s the point of working or eating or enjoying myself or doing anything at all if I\u2019m just going to stop existing one day? God, I'm so jealous of my mother - she was a religious woman who saw death as a release. I lost my faith at a young age and have nothing to cushion myself against the fear of oblivion. \n\nI went to a doctor on Tuesday and was put on Lexapro and Buspar, but it doesn\u2019t seem to be doing anything yet past giving me panic attacks. I\u2019m struggling to care for myself more than the bare minimum, can\u2019t focus on anything past constantly reading up about death and mortality, and am wearing my exhaustion on my face. I want to get myself back before I really hit rock bottom, but I don\u2019t know how to do this anymore. \n",

                "body": "Hey There!  \n  \nI'm so sorry to hear that you're going through such a tough time. Anxiety, especially when it spirals into existential fears, can be incredibly overwhelming, but it's important to remember you're not alone in feeling this way. It sounds like you've been carrying a heavy load for a long time, and it's okay to feel the way you do given everything you've been through and are currently facing.\n\nThe first thing to remember is that medication, often takes a few weeks to start showing its effects, so it's normal not to feel immediate relief. It's also not uncommon to experience an adjustment period where your body is getting used to the medication. If the side effects feel unbearable, it is worth discussing with your doctor. They can adjust the dosage or try a different medication that might work better for you.\n\nYour job, while fulfilling, exposes you to a lot of heavy emotional content, and, understandably, it could contribute to these feelings. It might be helpful to explore strategies with a therapist that can help you compartmentalize those aspects of your job. Therapy could also offer you a space to explore your fears about death, your feelings about your personal and professional life, and your identity in a confidential and supportive environment.\n\nRegarding your feelings about life milestones and the pressure to have achieved certain things by now, it's never too late to pursue what makes you happy or to change the course of your life. Your 30s or any age is not the end of the line; many people find new beginnings and paths at various stages of life. It's also okay to mourn the loss of your 20s to caregiving and hardship but don't let it define your future.\n\nIt might also be helpful to connect with others who share similar experiences, support groups for those dealing with anxiety, or forums for people who have lost a parent. Connecting with others can sometimes provide a sense of belonging and understanding that is hard to find elsewhere.\n\nRemember, taking the step to go to a doctor was a huge move in the right direction. It shows your strength and your desire to feel better, even when everything feels overwhelming. Hold onto that courage and keep reaching out for support. You deserve to find peace and fulfillment in your life, and with time and the right support, things can get better.\n\nTake care of yourself, and remember, it's okay to reach out for help. You're doing the best you can with what you have right now.\n\nLaura",

I don't really think of myself as carrying a heavy emotional load most days, but right now, it really does feel like I'm buckling under the weight of everything that's built up over the years. \n\nI'll remember that about the meds - this is my first time being put on that medication, and the panic attack I had on it was terrifying. But it was nice to hear \"what you're feeling isn't normal, and you need help\" after years of having my problems written off. Unfortunately, my current plan does not cover mental health services, and I can't afford the out of pocket costs. I'm going to look for alternatives, if possible.\n\nAnd thanks... I know I'm hardly the only millennial to feel like they're failing at adulthood compared to our parents - mine were late Boomers who married at 26 - but it's become crushing to think about. I already set a few goals for this year, so I'm going to keep trying to push forward if I can.\n\nIt's hard to get the motivation to care for myself right now - I finished my workload for the day, but I felt like a robot the whole time. But I want to keep pushing forward. Despite everything, I want to get myself back, and while I'm used to letting myself flounder on my own, I want to get better at reaching out."

I don\u2019t really know if this is the place to post this but I\u2019ve been having some issues for a while now and I just wanted to ask anonymously.\n\nI\u2019m 27M and whenever I feel anxious it just feels like my bladder is so full it\u2019s about to explode. During my worst days, I would run to the restroom every 15 to 30 minutes to have barely any pee. Thankfully I haven\u2019t had a day like that for a few months but when I\u2019m stressed an hour still seems like an eternity. This is only when I\u2019m anxious by the way. Whenever I\u2019m at home and feel comfortable I do not have any issues at all. I\u2019ll end up using the restroom every 5 to 6 hours and not have any awkward feelings.\n\nI\u2019ve recently graduated and I started working a few months ago. I thankfully have a job that allows WFH but I have to go into the office once a week. My office day has a huge impact on my life as my commute to work is around 5 hours in total. This gives me an insane amount of anxiety every week. It has come to the point that I won\u2019t drink anything the day before and the day itself. Our office day is on Wednesday so I take a few sips on Tuesday when I wake up and then don\u2019t drink anything until I\u2019m back home on Wednesday evening. This way I don\u2019t struggle too much with my bladder but it makes me feel so incredibly miserable.\n\nOutside of work, I\u2019ve ended up completely isolated. The thought of doing anything makes me mortified thinking about my bladder. I\u2019m not a big drinker anyways but I still avoid drinking \u2018a lot\u2019 whenever I know I have to leave the house.\n\nI was wondering if anyone has a similar experience and might be able to help me out? I saw a therapist for a while but I felt like I was getting nowhere because I suck at talking about all of this. I felt guilty for wasting their time as I struggled to make any progress so I stopped going. I\u2019m ashamed of this whole situation because IRL I don\u2019t know anyone who struggles with something like this.",

I really wish I could go right to him, shake his hands, talk to him and be a good friend to him. But I can't do as simple a thing as even saying hi to him. He freaks me out. And what freaks me out more is he's aware of my anxious mind. He knows he freaks me out. And I wish I could go right to him without my whole body shaking \ud83d\ude2d I just can't. And he wouldn't know why I act in this weird way. He would assume I'm weird or just plain rude or unfriendly. And I can't even explain myself. He's been nice to me but in every occasion, I was apparently acting rude because of my anxiety. \nI just look at him, but never dare to go even greet him. And he would make negative assumptions about me. I don't know how to deal with this and my anxiety is just going up instead of down, because I keep telling myself I'm stupid. \n\nBut if I go to him, what am I really gonna say? And what if I shake? Or what if I sweat or stutter? Or blush or seem confused? He'd make negative assumptions about me in either ways. And I've been trying to deal with my anxiety for the past years, and it's not calming down. And I can't deal with it alone. And I asked for help but I wasn't really helped. I feel so down right now. Hope someone shares their opinions with me. ",

        "body": "I'm gonna tell my story of what happened in my last job and hopefully you guys tell me what I can improve on.\n\nI got hired at this very low end job. Everyday i start by greeting literally everyone at work, even people who i don't know, always had this big fake smile because at work you have to greet every customer and coworker like that (so I thought) But the thing is obviously I'm extremely awkward, shy, introverted and have crippling social anxiety, depression, adhd etc everything to a 1000. And most people can tell that immediately. In work some ppl are genuine and are nice back, some ppl have this \"not this loser again, this is too early in the morning\" look and some give out a quiet sigh.\n\nSo this is my 1st mistake, I come off as too desperate, not everyone is an npc and not everyone is obligated to be nice.\n\nLike I mentioned before i have everything on a 1000 and that hinders my work performance, socializing and everything i do, sometimes i pretty much freeze and are left on people's mercy, and some bad apples will try to take advantage of me, some people give out this vibe like \"If this loser can make money working here, than I can hire my own friends and family too\" and try to get my fired. \n\n\n2nd mistake, I'm just not assertive or confident enough. And with my lack of experience i come off as being too afraid to make a mistake despite being just as qualified as them.\n\n\nIt's a very low end job so I'm the only white guy there. Most coworkers there are REALLY NICE to you for the first few days because they don't know if you might be someone's friend or maybe you're the boss's nepo hire, but once you come out as an outcast introvert who likes sitting alone at the dinner table to avoid socializing you will get very different looks. \n\nThe type of coworkers there. Old coworkers are usually okay there cuz they've seen it all before. White women have this nonchalant attitude, like they don't care what happens. Black, arab and eatern european guys are hard working and helpful but they will **roast** tf out of you, they aren't that bad, most of my time there was working with them. Black women are usually the most tense to me for some reason, they come off as very moody and desperate, and would blame me first if anything were to go wrong. Latino guys are some of the nicest always. The one asian dude and chick there were okay, but I always felt that Asian ppl get the ick super easily, they always pick up on the awkward cues. Arab and Latino women feels like they try to be extra nice to you cuz they pity you. The one or two fellow socially awkward anxious ppl there made me feel bad.\n\nThen basically I got fired there cuz a blk wm coworker outed me cuz she didn't wanna work the holidays with a rookie, despite telling me she has years of experience herself she wanted to be with someone who would do most of the work so she can chill. I got super depressed hearing all this being said to my face infront of everyone. I'm a **substitute** and dont work there permanently, so only when someone is sick i could come in, I didn't wanna work for a couple of days after feeling depressed, and they fired me after.\n\n3rd mistake ???\n\n\nMy takeaway is you have to earn people's respect and trust by being very competent, dependable and patient, all traits i gotta work on. And despite what some people might say, It's not a just front because I'm awkward or have anxiety I'm genuinely a nice guy and i try to be friendly and nice to everyone all the time, it's just good experience to have for next time.",

That is the adult, grown up you.  \nThat objectively knows that the worst thing that can happen is that someone is going to reject you.  \n  \nThen there is the anxious part that learned that being rejected in this situation equals failure in life, failure as a human being.  \nIt has a vivid imagination of the most shameful things that could happen when you fail.\n\nThe last one, who is so counterproductive, is the one that once the opportunity has passed, starts to criticise you and keeps telling you how you failed. And failing is a deadly sin for him.  \nHe wouldn't say a word if you would succeed, he would be proud of you, the womanizer.\n\nI see that last part everytime I have a thought that keeps referring to me as \"You\".  \n\"You should have...\" \"You are such an idiot\"....  \nThat's where I personally find my father, who took everything out of everybodies hand in the family, never was there to teach me any valuable lesson and only showed his presence when I failed in school.  \nThat's when suddenly I got all the attention, for all the wrong reasons,  \nSo personal failure was associated with conflict in the family and all the negative emotions that come with it.  \n  \nWhat did I learn? To not even try, because no one taught me that mistakes make you grow and learn, instead I got scolded for not matching the expectations.  \n\n\nI don't know if I will ever get over that hurdle, it took a long long time to realize these mental conundrums, yet knowing is only half the way. You and I have to overcome them.\n\nMaybe there was something that resonated with you, I hope so.\n\nBe aware of your thoughts and from which time, place and person in your life they come from.\n\nThere is an adult, more rational you, whose voice is often drowned by the voice of fear and self-criticism.  \n  \nYou are the captain of your ship, they are just the crew.",

        "body": "Hi, so for the fast five months I worked in a warehouse. It wasn't a bad job, the people were nice and company culture was great. But I'd worked manual labor jobs for years, and I think I've outgrown them (that's what my therapist says). Every day I dreaded getting up at 5am to go to work (I'm also not a morning person). I would sometimes find excuses to stay home, or sometimes I would physically feel unwell so I stayed home. I hadn't worked a full five-day work week in at least a month. I was getting in trouble at work for my attendance AND productivity. I would even imagine getting into traffic accidents just to avoid going to work...yeah, it was that bad. I have pretty bad depression and anxiety, and working a job I just didn't enjoy was making my mental health tank so hard. I'm a creative writer and I was trying to use this job as just a way to pay the bills until I got my writing off the ground, but when I came home from work I'd be too physically and mentally exhausted to do anything but lay on the couch most days. \n\nI explained this to my therapist and she agreed that I needed to find another job. I also told this to my mom, and she agreed. I have a close relationship with her, and I value her opinion on lots of things. She said I shouldn't quit my job until I had another one lined up. A smart piece of advice, and one I tried to follow for about two weeks. But last week...I hit my breaking point. And I went to my manager and explained my situation and she agreed that it was probably better that I resigned (if I didn't then I would probably be fired anyway). I'm glad she was so understanding, and I immediately felt freer and more hopeful about life after leaving, but I worry about how my mom will react. She's very practical and realistic and is the kind of person that can stick it out in crappy situations like this as long as necessary. I've been applying to jobs and I have some money to last me a little bit (maybe a month or two before I really start having trouble) but I'm still anxious that she will disapprove and lecture me and make me feel bad about my decision. I did it for my mental health and to find something better. I want this year to be about creating the life I want. Was I selfish for doing this? How do I go about telling my mom I quit my job? ",

        "body": "Hi all, \n\nI recently had an upper respiratory virus and was prescribed fluticasone (Flonase) nasal spray to help ease congestion. I took 2 doses as prescribed the 1st day and one dose the following day and by evening on the second day I was experiencing extreme panic and anxiety. Generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and depression are all part of my mental health history however I was relatively stable and had not had a panic attack in about 2 months until taking the Flonase. Briefly exploring online, it looks like perhaps other people have experienced a similar thing. It\u2019s now been 3.5 days since the last dose of Flonase and although I don\u2019t feel as stable as before using it, I do think I\u2019m improving each day. \n\nJust looking to see if anyone else has gone through a similar experience and if so, did anything help? Thank you in advance for responses, opinions, or advice! \n ",

For a few months after that I felt pretty \"normal\". But then I started having panic attacks again. So I quit. When I say the withdrawals were horrible I mean they were horrible. The \"brain zaps\" occurred every time I moved my eyes for about 3 weeks. Since being off of them I don't notice much of a difference than being on them so I would say they're not worth it. My best recommendation is get consistent exercise. It's something I really struggle to keep up with but I walk quite a bit at work so that helps.",

                "body": "Yes benzos are addictive and have pretty bad side effects if taken long term. But long term is definitely longer than 2weeks . I was put on clorazepate for 2 weeks, then tapered for 2 weeks and at that time, it saved my life.\n\nCan't say the same for ssris, I was put on zoloft 50mg and I lasted 3 days before I had a panic attack because I couldn't feel anything. It's not uncommon to feel that way, but I wasn't warned and it scared me. The dose was also way too high (I'm very sensitive to meds)\n\nI also took propranolol and I also couldn't continue as it isn't supposed to be given to people with low blood pressure, which is my case. I am forbidden from giving my blood because of that so you can imagine how bad of an idea it was to give me a med for high blood pressure.\n\n\nIn the end, taking meds is quite a personal experience. It often takes multiple changes before finding the med that works for you!",

                "body": "Like others said, yes benzos can cause dependency if used long term. Those are quite small doses though, so short term I wouldn\u2019t be concerned about it. And tbh, the times I\u2019ve taken benzos at such small doses I haven\u2019t felt much either way. They were for severe needle phobia though, YMMV. I\u2019ve heard people say benzos work wonders for panic attacks and whatnot as well.\n\nAs for escitalopram, I spent years on SSRIs for depression, can\u2019t say much for how they affected my anxiety, but DAMN they are a bitch to get off, and the side effects suck. They made me feel very robotic and apathetic, the last one I was on was escitalopram, I stopped (with psych\u2019s permission) last fall. Withdrawals were an absolute nightmare. Lasted a few weeks, felt so terrible. I\u2019m glad I stopped though, I do feel better. Take that as you will, they might help you, but especially long term use will cause withdrawals, so something to keep in mind, I\u2019d suggest looking into that. \n\nLastly, propranolol, big yes from me. Only thing that\u2019s stopped my physical symptoms of anxiety. The heart beating out of my chest, hot flashes, shaking, etc. It is one I\u2019d say usually needs to be used in combination with another anxiety med, at least for someone with severe anxiety like myself, to help the mental side of things, as propranolol affects your body, not your mind. It\u2019s usually used for blood pressure actually. So I know it feels like \u201ca lot\u201d of meds for a first time user, but at least propranolol is something that I think is commonly used with other drugs. I personally take buspirone twice daily as well, which is an anxiolytic, and it\u2019s my wonder combo for anxiety. Been on them for years and they work great. So yeah overall, propranolol is definitely a great addition for those who have physical anxiety symptoms. I think I take 20mg daily.",

I might go to an outing at the bar every other month or so and have 1 or 2 drinks. My anxiety has only gotten worse over time. I started my therapy and medication journey in 2018. Over the course of 6 years, I\u2019ve been on prozac, lexapro, zoloft, wellbutrin, buspar, and hydroxyzine. Some did not help, others just never got me to where I wanted to be and only temporarily helped. I\u2019ve also been on and off with medications(like on medication for 6-10 months and then wean off and stop taking anything for awhile), and have had multiple therapists and psychiatrists. I know you can\u2019t be prescribed heavier stuff over the phone, so I finally found an in person psychiatrist I was able to see in just a couple weeks. I was 2 mins from my appointment when I get a call that he\u2019s sick and can\u2019t come in. So I went into the office anyway and used their iPad to do a video visit. He wants to put me on Effexor. I told him my anxiety is SO bad that I\u2019m barely able to drive without freaking out, I can\u2019t go grocery shopping alone anymore, I\u2019ve been out of work since December because of how bad it is. I feel dizzy and like I\u2019m going to pass out any time I go into public. It\u2019s ruining my life. He said I have MDD, GAD, and Panic disorder. And that Effexor and therapy will help. Why are doctors so against prescribing heavier things, even at low doses? I feel like none of these SSRI\u2019s and SNRI\u2019s are doing anything and I feel like there\u2019s no hope of me ever getting better.

I had a friend who lobbied in my country about the side effects of long term benzo use and had a doco made about it. They actually change your brain chemistry so when you come off them, your brain can't cope its on own anymore. Its a pity that thy feel effective at the time, but the long term effects after coming off thm are basically catastrophic\n\nEdit: they're also addictive and are the closest feeling to self medicating with alcohol, which also has similar dire consequences long term"

I had tried xanax not long before my first psych appointment and was completely blown away by it. I took .5mg, and felt *normal* for the first time in years.\n\nI asked my psychiatrist for a prescription when I had my first appointment. Instead, I got to listen to her go off, passionately, about how xanax is 40 times more addictive than cocaine. I won't argue that it isn't highly addictive, but let's calm down a bit. Roughly a year later, at the dentist, I asked for nitrous when getting a tooth pulled (I'm a wimp). The dental assistant went into a similar rant about nitrous being more harmful than weed. Instead, the dentist wrote me a script for a very very strong benzo lol\n\nI consider those humorous anecdotes. I've been taking xanax for 8 years, but discourage anyone who asks me if I'd recommend it. I won't scare them with the addictive qualities of cocaine, but it is highly addictive, and it does have deadly withdrawals."

                "body": "Heavier stuff has a high potential for abuse, and are REALLY hard on your body if you take them for years on end. Benzodiazepine\u2019s for example have a very high risk of dependency. Especially if you\u2019re younger, doctors try to avoid setting you up for long term use of those meds. \n\nSomething like Effexor (which I happen to take for my bipolar) doesn\u2019t have that potential for abuse, because it\u2019s not addictive. \n\nThe big thing about a medication like Effexor (SSRIs & SNRIs) is you can have the anxiety reduction without losing any cognitive or motor function like you can have from benzo\u2019s. \n\nWhereas benzo\u2019s will chill you out while they\u2019re in effect, the Effexor will help you 24hrs a day. What I found is my baseline level of anxiety (1 being totally relaxed - 10 being a superultradoublemega panic attack) I went from resting at a 7 to resting at a 3 or 4. It freed up a lot of my \u201cbrainpower\u201d in essence. Imagine opening task manager on your computer and seeing \u201cStress.exe\u201d eating up 80% of your CPU power all the time. It really limits what you can do with that computer because it\u2019s always maxed out, even when it\u2019s just resting. \n\nBring that 80% down to 30%-40% and you can actually get some work done. \n\nI won\u2019t tell you that Effexor fixed my anxiety, because it hasn\u2019t. However it has made living a whole lot easier because my anxiety is now manageable. \n\nMy dad & sister are bipolar like me and take Effexor (plus a mood stabilizer, like me) and it worked well for them with minimal side effects. My mom has some issues with mild-moderate anxiety and depression and found a low dose (37.5mg is the lowest dose for Effexor XR as far as I know) helped her a lot as well. \n\nKeep in mind, everyone reacts differently to different medications. My sister took five years of experimenting with her psychiatrist to finally find a good medication mix for her. Her and I are actually on doses beyond the manufacturer\u2019s guidelines (I take 300mg, she takes 450mg) and we have no side effects. I only had side effects for the first two weeks I was taking Effexor. However, that\u2019s back to the \u201cit\u2019s different for everyone\u201d thing because I know people who went on the same dose as my mom (37.5mg) and couldn\u2019t sleep and had a bunch of side effects, but that\u2019s the same story I hear about every antidepressant. \n\nJust give it a go for 4-6 weeks, and see if it helps. Keep in mind it\u2019s not like Prozac where you take it and start feeling better in 15-30min. SNRIs take a few weeks to build up in your system and take full effect. You won\u2019t feel much different after a day or two, but after about 3-4 weeks I just woke up and realized \u201cI think I feel better\u201d\n\nMake sure to take it in the mornings! I took it with dinner when I started taking it and I was up all night. Turns out \u201crestlessness\u201d is a common side effect, which can cause \u201csleep disturbances\u201d (another common side effect), but once I switched to mornings I felt a lot better. \n\nLastly, Effexor can have some rather unpleasant withdrawals. At my 300mg dose, if I miss my meds Monday, and don\u2019t take them Tuesday morning, I will feel like SHIT by about midday Tuesday. Generally I get a nasty headache, neck ache, nausea, dizziness, and brain zaps. On top of the physical withdrawal effects, there are a number of listed possible psychological withdrawal effects, but I haven\u2019t had much experience with that. I just go back to being bipolar and anxious as usual. \n\nBecause of these withdrawals, DO NOT suddenly stop taking the medication. If you find you\u2019re getting too many side effects after a week or two (or they\u2019re bad enough in the first weeks) call your doctors office! Your doctor will walk you through weaning yourself off it.",

The type of anxiety you\u2019re describing it does sound like Effexor is a good thing to try, and it definitely is a heavier thing. If you\u2019re at a place where you\u2019re needing anxiety relief in all areas of your life, it sounds like you think being on a benzo will help, but it really doesn\u2019t help like that. For some panic attacks or specific anxieties (things that may cause panic like going to the dentist, or flying on a plane) that it can help with while being used sparingly is one thing. But it\u2019s not for getting your day to day anxiety under control. Using it that way will create more problems than it will fix.",

May be describing it pretty soon. But if Benzos are taken correctly you are more likely to die being struck by lightning than die from a Benzo. Way more likely to die from an allergic reaction or from a painkiller like Ibuprofen. Addiction and physical dependence are two different things, don't confuse them."

That doesn't mean everyone should take it. It means some people need it, that's what it means. I can enjoy things and stay calm. I can live my life more or less normally. That is 100% worth any potential side effects like cognitive decline later. My father is 81, he took benzos for 30 years and he's still sharp for his age. Some people do well with them. The people that abuse that drug class or mix it with opioids and/or a lot of alcohol are ruining the drug for the rest of us responsible and functional users. \n\nIf someone has 'pure' anxiety, an antidepressant often will not work. If an MD will not prescribe a benzo, you can try something else sedating like Hydroxyzine or Trazodone. But I've read the description of those and surprise surprise, those and many other drugs are not supposed to be taken daily long-term and may cause memory issues too. Even Benadryl can cause issues and it's over the counter. \n\nI would try to help yourself naturally as much as you can. Try to get at least one hour of aerobic exercise; for your age that's probably a heart rate over 130 for 60+ minutes. Don't be afraid to do that, you WILL feel better afterwards and become hooked on the good feeling. Also Niacinamide 1000-3000 mg/day can act as a natural sedative, and it helps me get to sleep at night. I really hope you can get better naturally as much as possible. Try deep breathing exercises and see if you can find some Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.",

                "body": "It's kinda dumb that so many people are against benzos now. Before the opiate crisis became big in the media, doctors were handing them out like candy. And a lot of the people riffing on how horrible they are don't even realize doctors don't avoid prescribing them because they're addictive or dangerous. They avoid it because of liability. Lots of different drugs can be dangerous, especially if the patient is misusing them. But now people who actually need benzos can't get them and have to resort to shit like SSRIs, which are not situational and come with some awful side effects. Does someone need a 120 pill bottle of Xanax every 30 days? Of course not. But now we can't even get 3 pills unless you're out of your mind at the ER for thousands of dollars.",

They say benzos are habit forming but will *never* work with me to prevent it. Even then I don\u2019t see how once every few months can cause dependence or addiction. \n\nNot to mention that the event has to be *objectively* anxiety inducing. Im sorry but that is complete and utter bullshit. Emotions at the heart are illogical, so there will never be a good excuse to objectively judge a persons fear based on the situation alone. Objectively, flying may seem more scary than making a phone call, but not for someone like me that has severe social anxiety. \n\nIts not like im looking to pop a pill for every single phone call or trip to the grocery store I make. I know that isn\u2019t sustainable, but why not for when I talk to family every few months, or that doctor appointment I keep delaying. What about getting my drivers license or getting a job?\n\nThese are all things I am unable to handle in my current state. Im not looking for an escape, I just want to lower it a bit so I can tolerate it. If I attempt these things now, I will just collapse/run and reinforce that fear. And given that I\u2019ve tried all other avenues: Therapy, a handful of medications, tons of tips and tricks from cbt. I don\u2019t see why you still wont help me. It just feels like you\u2019re not doing your job as a doctor.\n\nSorry for the rant. I think I might need to have a long chat with my doctor\u2026"

                "body": "So yeah benzos can help but there are a couple of things to keep in mind especially: \n\n1. A psychiatrist may not feel comfortable prescribing them right away to you if they do prescribe them. A lot of doctors are just that way because they are:\n2. They are high in abuse rates. You may not have any addiction issues but 20-30 minutes on a telehealth wont determine that. Or it might be something you do develop a physical need for because:\n3. You build tolerance *fast* and that tolerance will not wane for years if at all. Once you take a few doses you will begin to notice \u201cah that 0.25mg of klonopin didn\u2019t help today. I should take 0.5mg\u201d and it grows. Even if you take a year off, you may never just be helped by that smaller dose the same way and rebound anxiety will get pretty bad if you do develop a dependence and try to wean off. Even if it\u2019s a controlled dependence, a doctor has you on them a few months regularly, it might suck coming off and you end up in a cycle of thinking your anxiety can\u2019t be controlled by anything else when your anxiety is likely heightened because you\u2019re dependent and it slingshots. You know how a person drinks coffee every morning and skips one day, they get a terrible headache? It\u2019s that but with your anxiety. \n4. If you are using them regularly and do not wean off appropriately you can possibly die. Alcohol and benzodiazepines are the 2 major addictive substances that you can die from just due to the effects of withdrawal.\n5. The DEA in the US is extremely strict and if a doctor is too liberal they get in trouble. They\u2019re prone to audits.\n5. There is debate currently on whether or not benzos increase the risk of developing dementia as you age or if it\u2019s only exacerbating existing dementia patients. We don\u2019t 100% know yet. \n\nI don\u2019t mean to sound like I\u2019m just preaching scare tactics, benzos work super well in emergencies, but these are big reasons doctors consider them. \n\nAnxiety and panic attacks are really responsive to therapy scientifically and I promise the doctor isn\u2019t trying to just keep you miserable. They have studied for a long time and are constantly keeping up on medical literature to help. It sucks a lot when you really want the relief right now, but they sit and weigh risks vs benefits, perhaps in further discussions with them as you both learn about each other more they will be a bit more liberal.",

This was fine for what I was experiencing--panic attacks related to something very specific that happened to me. When I had to do that thing, I would have experienced a repeat attack without the benzo. At the same time, though, I did desensitization therapy. Benzos are appropriate for very short term situations, or for things like anxiety right before surgery or claustrophobia for an MRI but they don't work for longer term anxiety.",

The very short term (like the span of weeks) they might be so in my experience doctors only prescribe them in like counts of 10.\n\nI\u2019m on Zoloft but it doesn\u2019t seem to do anything at all, no side effects, no effects, no withdrawals when I come off it, and my psych is not interested in switching me to anything else. Wellbutrin was a candidate but I\u2019m seizure prone so I can\u2019t take it.\n\nPropranolol, a beta blocker, has helped me with the physical symptoms of anxiety situationally (like I take it before doing trauma therapy). Trazadone has helped me with sleep and I take it for maybe a week at a time when anxiety is high. Those are the ones I use for acute anxiety and they\u2019re surprisingly effective but not addictive.\n\nAlso I would try fish oil, like 2-6 capsules a day, it can\u2019t hurt and there is research that it reduces inflammation in the brain that causes anxiety. I also cycle through ashwagandha and NAC and those stress gummies in 4-6 week chunks, I don\u2019t think they help a ton but they give a little edge.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to be dismissive \u201chave you tried fish oil??\u201d But in my experience there is no one silver bullet for anxiety. You really have to throw everything that works at it to make a measurable difference, lifestyle interventions, exercise, supplements, therapy, prescriptions.

I was very lucky and was fine, but obviously do not recommend. I am so glad that they aren\u2019t being prescribed like that anymore.

Most of them are garbage for me. I have both anxiety and depression. Wellbutrin is the only thing that works for my depression but it doesn\u2019t touch my anxiety. 20 years ago it was as easy as telling my doctor I have anxiety, to be prescribed Xanax. Both of my parents take it; one is definitely addicted to it. I\u2019ve found now, 20 years later, that none of my therapists, doctors or nurse practitioners ever recommend it. And I never outright ask for it. So I am not prescribed it, ever, anymore, at this point in my life. But here\u2019s the thing: I remember\u2026 it DID work and it worked amazingly for getting rid of panic attacks pretty much on the spot. But it also meant I checked out of life for a while, because man did it zonk me out. I know taking them long term, that feeling goes away. But I never took it daily. I never struggled as intensely with anxiety as I do now. All that to say\u2026 that two weeks ago my doctor put me on propranolol\u2026 and I honest to god haven\u2019t felt anxiety outside of actual fight or flight moments (one, and I can\u2019t even remember what it was! Something actually ~scared~ me and it wasn\u2019t my brain\u2026 so I felt that panic start and quickly end) since I started taking it. It\u2019s not a benzo\u2026 it\u2019s a beta blocker\u2026 but it blocks all of the physical symptoms of anxiety without any of the mental \u201ccheck out\u201d side effects. And for me, the physical symptoms that come along with anxiety are what affects me the most. To say it\u2019s been life changing is an understatement! I just wanted to throw my experience into the chat in case it\u2019s something that might work for you, too. Your providers might not be as iffy about prescribing it as they are about something like Xanax. It may be worth a try!"

That's my approach anyway. And if we have real triggers, exposure therapy in small doses as we can handle it to face our fears instead of covering them up, is probably a good long-term strategy."

Meaning doctors have to jump through extra hoops to prescribe them. Doctors are also don\u2019t want another opioid crisis on their hands so they are extremely cautious when prescribing which is understandable but ultimately hurts those patients that need the medication. I hope that makes sense. I\u2019ve been in your shoes and it\u2019s hard, I hope you\u2019re able to find some relief with Effexor- therapy can also be really beneficial if you\u2019re committed to it. Medication isn\u2019t meant to be a fix all or \u201ccure\u201d your anxiety, using it in combination with therapy can really help you get to the root of your anxiety and help you to find ways to cope with it",

                "body": "I think you also need to switch your mindset, instead of taking a drug to numb the issues- go on a mental journey to heal yourself. You can do this. Pinpoint your anxiety, sometimes it\u2019s a young version of ourselves that are coming up and needing some attention. Understand and tell yourself that you are going to be okay. Speak to yourself and your inner dialogue positively. Treat yourself really well. Workout, adopt healthy appetite, eat more protein (this truly helps brain chemistry). Adopt positivity and gratitude- start small- what are you grateful for right now? Add to it daily? See the good in the world.\u00a0\n\nI was like you for too long- I had negative view on the world. I literally just healed and it takes daily work and positive thinking and thoughts to help me not revert back to the negative void I had become. Stay true to yourself. Many times when we aren\u2019t true to who we are, it will basically spiral into this shit tornado that manifests as depression and anxiety. Truth is everything- it\u2019s as simple as a friend asking you to go out to lunch to a place you don\u2019t want to go- and you take one for the team and go anyway- that\u2019s not your truth/ you have to stand up and build confidence and say \u201chey I would love to go to lunch but I\u2019d like to go x,x, or x.\u201d We make tiny decisions daily - and if we aren\u2019t making them in truth to what we want and who we are, then we are not actually being ourselves and we end up living a life we do not enjoy.\u00a0\n\nI recommend building your confidence, check out the podcast Trish Blackwell on confidence, it has helped me sooo much- and in much older than you. I suffered from similar issues and trauma childhood,\n\nStart slow- be good to yourself/ you can do this without medication I promise. \ud83d\udc97",

I feel like it was almost placebo without it actually being placebo. I\u2019d convince myself I could not have a panic attack because of the medication. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s making it worse, it\u2019s on and off for me. I\u2019ll feel okay for a few months, then my anxiety hits harder than usual. I\u2019m unable to drive, I can\u2019t work, I can\u2019t go out. Then after awhile, I\u2019ll find the strength to drive again, go out, etc. But this time, it\u2019s been nonstop for 3 months."

Functioning has been really difficult.  I don't know if I want to start medication again.  Has anyone been able to get off meds?  Are there other things that have helped you?\n\nFor some background, I was prescribed Zoloft by a pcp when I was a teenager. I've been on various SSRIs for literally 20 years. I've never been to any kind of specialist or therapy, just pcps that keep filling the prescription. I just really don't know if I \"need\" meds, or want to be dependent on them the rest of my life. I've tried stopping a few times, but never got past the initial withdraw.\r  \n\r  \nI've been on celexa the longest and most recently. I stopped taking it in September, so, 5 months ago. Some days I feel like I'm fine, but generally it's been a ROUGH 5 months. I had the initial horrible withdrawal (... brain zaps, dizziness, anger outbursts, pain in my body, headaches, terrible RLS for about a month. Because I did not taper )\r  \n\r  \nETA: during this time, I also found out I have very low iron levels. This can mimic depression. I have diabetes. I'm often fatigued. I've also had issues with iron supplements causing me physical (and maybe mental) issues. I'm so confused about what is a symptom of what.\r  \n\r  \nIt's like, \"what came first... the chicken or the egg?\"\r  \n\r  \nRight now, I feel like I'm turning into a different person. I feel consumed by emotions. I have anxiety that I never had before. Impending doom when I wake up, fear without any stimulus, crying over anything or nothing at all. I have a pleasant life, a good job, I don't have trauma. But I feel like crap about every other day. I can't help others and I'm always upset about how bad I feel. It is difficult to do my job or enjoy anything.  I've called off work because I panic in the morning.\r  \n\r  \nFrom what I've been reading, \"withdrawl\" lasts for a very long time. Most people go back on meds when they think they are relapsing, but its all still a form of withdrawal.\r  \n\r  \nHow do I know if I'm actually depressed/ having anxiety, or if I'm having withdrawal symptoms?\n\n Am I just going to have to take meds for the rest of my life to feel normal?\r  \n\r  \nIf you stopped ssris, what did that look like for you? \n\nHow long until you started to feel normal? \n\nDid you take/ do something else? \n\nWhat helped?",

        "body": "Hello peeps.\n\nI am 28 years of age, almost 29, and just for the first time in my life I have been experiencing anxiety. Before starting my life story just wanted to say that I appreciate any positive feedback, outlets, or your personal experience with anxiety. It\u2019s nice to know we aren\u2019t alone and can work through these obstacles together.\n\nLast year I had my first panic attack, at work, out of nowhere\u2026 not knowing what was going on or what to do. I thought I was having a heart attack\u2026 sweating profusely, arm/face tingling, fight or flight adrenaline, heart pounding through my chest. I tried leaving and going home but my boss wouldn\u2019t let me drive. He had the nurse on site check my blood pressure. The nurse told me I needed to go to urgent care or the ER\u2026 which freaked me out even more. Fast forward it was just a panic attack, they prescribed me hydroxyzine and I took the next few days off work. \n\nAfter this I had in and out minor panic attacks that eventually went away. (By the way I forgot to mention i was a heavy drinker, smoker, tobacco user, lots of caffeine, no exercise, stressful job, and never got a lot of sleep) I turned my life around by changing all the lifestyle choices I mentioned above by going sober. After everything went back to normal\u2026 I started drinking and smoking again, which lead to lack of sleep, no exercising, and constant stress at work. My anxiety came back, but this time it was different\u2026 more intense, more often, and to the point I was calling out of work for weeks.\n\nDoctor started me on busprione (they always tried to give me SSRIs but I was against it everytime). Busprione took a bit to kick in and was awesome for a week\u2026 then I started getting the worst headaches of my life. This itself started my anxiety again even through the buspirone. Messaged my doc and she said to see if the headaches go away and check in later during the week. Headaches wouldn\u2019t stop and I started to taper off the busprione. In the meantime she prescribed me propranolol. This helped so much with my blood pressure, headaches, and a little bit with anxiety. Long story short\u2026 the propranolol wasn\u2019t enough so I saw a doc again for anxiety and they started me on escitalopram (brand lexipro). I am on day 4 and tbh it has been changing my life for the better. I do a lot of public speaking at work, and I can finally do that again without a panic attack in my head. I am starting to go back to work and feel like I can live my life. I hope it keeps getting better though, but for a day 4 I can tell a difference.\n\nSide note: all this kinda stems from my fear of that initial attack and also thinking something is wrong with my heart or cardiovascular system. My family has a lot of heart issues. I saw a heart specialist and we\u2019re doing test just to see. \n\nThanks for listening to me. If anyone has anything that has helped them or similar experiences I\u2019d love to hear. Thx.\n",

This pattern has been going on for as long as i can remember and the despair that comes from it is just too much to handle. Today instead of leaving home early as usual i hung up a bit more than my usual and noticed a big difference in my anxiety level. The awkwardness is less and although i may also be struggling but not as much as the beginning.\n\n\nThis a reminder from me to myself to hang up a bit longer,anxiety will get less,set a 30 mins timer and see the change for yourself. And most importantly have some compassion. \n",

Anytime i am sick or something is off with my body I automatically go into panic mode and think the worst possible thing will happen. I have a cold and last night I had a fever which caused me to have a full on anxiety attack my heart rate went all the way up to 160 and stayed high for most of the night cause I couldn\u2019t stop checking it and freaking out every time it didn\u2019t go down. I know being sick usually increases your heart right but I still couldn\u2019t shake it off. I went to the ER last week for stomach pains and I of course thought there was something really wrong with me they did a CT scan and everything came back normal. The doctor said probably just some gas. I\u2019ve also had blood work done and other than me being anemic everything else is normal. \n Does anyone else struggle with this? Any tips to help with this? I know my fears can be irrational but it\u2019s so hard to reel back in when I\u2019m already in that state of nervousness. ",

My guess is over stress phantom pains that go away with the stress and anxiety. Who else experiences these?

Becoming dizzy, having this TV-Static kind of vision when standing up and so on, weird sensations on my forehead and also between my eyebrows, which I hate, eye floaters and so on. Today I was doing a skiing tour (like, walking up the mountain on your skis, then going down again) - and afterwards I felt like I couldn't breathe in anymore. Is this anxiety induced? Does anyone know this? Especially after doing exercise? Is this all anxiety or could it be something else? \n\nThank you guys ",

I just cant get the fear of dying out of my head, its just a intrusive thought that creeps up on me and overwhelms me. Specifically the thought of not being conscious anymore. I don\u2019t know what to do.\nI have Gad but this worsened period of anxiety has been going on for over nearly two months now and i have gone down 5 kg and am now weighing 46 kg. This is because even eating is seen as a threat by my brain. \n\nI used to be on 20 mg of escitalopram for 4 years which helped a lot but it stopped having the same effect so i was switched over to trintellix for a month which made my anxiety even worse. Now I\u2019m currently on 25 mg sertraline for 3 days and feeling awful.\n\nDoes anyone have any experience with sertraline and this type of death anxiety? Im feeling like i just can\u2019t take it anymore. ",

        "body": "Hello. I'm female, 30, in therapy for a little over 5 years, on Zoloft for a year and a half for anxiety and depression. Mostly due to childhood stuff. My mom also has severe anxiety and her own trauma plus some narcissitc tendencies sprinkled on top. \n\nTomorrow is my 31st birthday. I'm going to drive home some 200 km. I'm struggling to shake off the anxiety for the drive. \nAs a preamble - when I was a child mom never allowed me on school trips that involved any kind of busses or cars deeming them unsafe. She didn't want me driving on the highway until I had a year of driving under my belt. She threw a fit when my uncle let me drive his little electric car. She said it was unsafe. \nLast week mom told me she's been feeling terrible dread and the feeling of some impending doom. She put on a nice smiley face when dad was around then refused to elaborate. My lovely anxiety ridden brain found the intrusive thought that follows: \"You're gonna crash and die on your birthday, of course you won't see your loved ones again and you'll never get married.\" \nI've been having difficulties shaking this off, and every time the traffic is hectic my brain goes in a lovely low key spiral. \n\nI filled up the gas, I cleaned the car, I pumped air in the tire, there's no alarms no nothing. \n\nI just wish to kick this anxiety \n\nAnd I recently tried stepping down the Zoloft, go for a lower dose but the anxiety got way worse so I had to go back. \n\nThis is so frustrating",

        "body": "So, I've always suffered from GAD and panic.  Been on Lexapro for over 10 years.  Its helped a lot.  So has exposure. Everyone will say I'm a very social, extroverted person.  I can talk with anybody and love to gab.  When I'm out socially I feel comfortable and happy.  My work life is the opposite. I get nervous talking to anyone higher up.  Super nervous for meetings, constantly worrying about public speaking at work, especially since I have a long time phobia.  Why am I such a \"charmer\" everywhere but when it comes to my workplace I am a complete nervous wreck and always have been.  Is this a common thing?  Can't understand why I'm like this.  I've had a really comfortable job for years, but suddenly it seems that I'm up for a big promotion which I need to put my family into a much better life.  I've turned down other better jobs because of my anxiety.  I'm terrified I'll panic at work, in front of bosses, etc.  I cant eat or sleep and i just want to drink every night to calm down. This community is always so helpful.  Hoping anyone has some advice for situation.  Thanks all.",

Sometimes it is simply necessary to clean the house as a task. I can clean a toilet after I use it. Make the bed when I get up but when I need to set time aside to clean I get so anxious. In my life I can't keep the house clean by doing these jobs as asides to the rest of my life. I work 60-70 hr weeks, 14 hr shifts. I need to spend time on my days off cleaning. But when it becomes this structured thing I get so anxious. \n\nI don't deal with anxiety often, and I'm not unsure of how to do these tasks. I can write a to do list, I can plan my day but I simply cannot start. No amount of prep or lack of prep seems to work when I simply /need/ to do a chore. \n\nDoes anyone have any advice??",

Also seek out high magnesium foods.  Magnesium inadequacy is *very* common and one of the main symptoms is anxiety.\n\n\\- DO get a good night's sleep.  Sleep eight hours straight, and do it at least three nights in a row before you assess.  Lack of sleep is enormously stressful on the body and brain, it's common and a huge driver of anxiety.\n\n\\- DO NOT drink much alcohol - the rebound effect from its depressive effects is a very strong anxiety trigger due to GABA activation.\n\n\\- DO NOT take much THC - it can mess with magnesium levels and also directly causes anxiety in a lot of people, either during the effects or in the rebound following.\n\n\\- DO get a moderate amount of exercise, which calms the body and mind and improves sleep.\n\n\\- DO eat reasonably well - low quality food with rapid absorption can cause blood sugar instability, which will mess with the brain.  Also drink plenty of water - low water intake causes anxiety (this has been studied).\n\n\\- DO practice a bit of meditation and a bit of self-care, anxiety can be a symptom of burnout.\n\n\\- DO get some outside time every day if possible, which has been demonstrated to help with anxiety.",

Cat puzzles or puzzles if happy flower houses. Just until my eyes got heavy and then I could sleep. Really worked (insomnia is also a side effect and I was able to beat it with puzzles)\n\n\nNot every time but something where you need to think logically that doesn't use creativity or a fear response. Sudokus might be great because you can print them out and do them when you're at school. I've also heard crosswords being helpful (did not help me at all though because my anxiety is attached to memories and word memory just triggers other stuff)\n\n\nOne if my previous therapists recommended me to sing the abcs in my head or sing them backwards especially if you feel like crying and you need it to stop immediately.\n\n\nAnd then food: Miso soup or hot green tea.\n\n\nAnd to reiterate those below:\nWalking outside (where there is nice nature or a breeze)\nCitrus fruits also help me (only thing I could eat when I was having severe anxiety episode)\n\n\nAlso exercise is super good. Just sometimes it might trigger some anxiety because some of the feelings it might give your body might resemble the same feelings your body recognizes as anxiety (I am also suffering from this right now. I have been dancing for at least 10 years but during lockdown I practiced by myself and now I went back to dance class with other people and I have the worst anxiety and can't move because my brain thinks my heavy breathing is a panic attack but it's just heavy breathing from exercise)",

Something about what it does to our eyes is extremely effective in calming the nervous system. I heard about this on an Andrew Huberman podcast and it does help to soothe.

BUT it\u2019s already one week I didn\u2019t had one. I tried a lot of plants and even a Xanax when it was question to go to the psychiatric hospital. But what helped me, is kava extract in drops. Take it 4 or 5 times a day. At night I add valerian, and it works like magic. The panics attacks was unbearable. Was thinking that I was loosing my mind. But what helped is that I let it take control completely. I went (concentrated) under my ribs (where is the root feeling of anxiety) and I imagined to give it the autorisation to spread all over my body and take completely control. The first time I thought it was madness, but after doing this for the first time in 2 months I was able to go back to sleep again (the anxiety wakes me up around 3:30 or 4 am every morning and then it\u2019s a complete night mare..). I am not always able to do so, because it asking a lot of ressources and strengths. But every time I can, I just spend a good day after!",

The brain gives you the scares and, in response, you do something that makes you feel better. The brain then seeks that constant good feeling by re-firing the circuits that cause anxiety.  If you start to improve, you subconsciously attribute the improvement to your hack and not your own internal healing and reassurance....so now you HAVE to do the hack or you will feel scared. And the cycle resets. \n\n  \nYou're rewarding your mind for making you scared. It sucks, too, because there's nothing worse than the crushing shadow of anxiety. I totally do this, too, even if I know it's going to drag out the problem.",

It works for me because I'm concentrated on everything around me instead of the anxiety.  Sometimes, I color in my adult coloring books or even kids coloring books. I also listen to Native music like drumming or flutes. I'm native American. I find that music grounds me. All of these methods make me be in the moment and slow my brain and heartbeat.",

It approaches anxiety as a bad habit and teaches you how to break the habit. I cannot express how much this has worked for me.\n\nAs far as quick anxiety fixes (which actually just reinforce anxiety). I would chew gum, have a shower, use an ice pack, smoke cbd, go for a walk, do a rubik's cube.\n\nI hope you get better.

Keeping your mind busy is what helps the most. Drawing and art is probably what got me through school the most.\n\nidk what your therapist has suggested, but I always try to look at the evidence. I have intense social anxiety, and so many things go through my head in seconds, its overwhelming like i cant actually think my own thoughts. Usually I'm triggered by social nuances that fly over my head- i get it in my mind thay everyone hates me, blah blah. So I try to Look At The Evidence.\n\nWhat are your triggers? those are important to know, so you can avoid them and also set boundaries that serve you.\n\nKnow that your anxiety =/= reality. \n\nIts helped me a lot when I was younger to visualize and personify my anxiety. It could be anything, like a buzzing fly that wont go away; a little monster that follows you around and tries to trip you; mine, i imagine like a sticky, black goo that is always on me, always slowing me down. When Its bad, i imagine that the goo is overcoming me, and i cant pull myself out. So either i stay calm, dont struggle, focus on the light until it subsides- or i reach out my hand and rely on someone else to help pull me out. or take a chill pill lmao now that i have the Rx\n\nkeep in mind that its not you that thinks these things, that its a different entity that seeks to sabatouge your life. Maybe some day, you'll be able to control and soothe the monster, to set food out so the fly wont bother you, or for me, to wash and change my shoes.\n\nLike, im a very visual person, so this helps me\n\ninbox is always open! \ud83d\udcab",

They took me up to this platform above the stage. It was pretty open and we stood up there and spoke for about ten minutes. When I was up there I felt so anxious like I was going to fall over the railings down onto the stage. I\u2019ve never been scared of heights before but it\u2019s really shaken me up\u2026 I feel like it\u2019s my anxiety about the job and everything manifesting in a weird fear of heights\n\nHas anyone else experienced this before?

        "body": "Hi everyone,\n\nDon't usually post here, or anywhere tbh, but this has been bothering me for years now and I could do with some answers/help.\n\n(26M) For the last few years, I've been waking almost every morning feeling sick and wanting to dry heave, sometimes actually resulting in being sick. This has caused me to have a few days where I'm just like \"nope\" and called in sick to work, which always made me feel guilty  as I always felt like I wasn't \"properly sick\" so I didn't deserve it off. But my job revolves around alot of driving and not exactly the sort of job I can just nip up to the toilet if I'm feeling crap again.\n\nYesterday and today are another one of those days. Nothing has happened at work that's making me anxious but I think it's just general anxiety panicking for the day as my job is somewhat stressful and that.\n\nI'm just wondering if anyone else has or has had this issue? It's affecting my life quite a bit now and I don't know what to do.\n\nAny help is appreciated, thank you.",

However, even sober there has been times where I\u2019ve woken up feeling nauseous cause of anxiety, I would take deep breaths in and exhale slowly, drink some water, play some meditation videos, you can even try rubbing Vicks vapor rub under your nose or keep a good smelling hand sanitizer on you to smell when you feel nauseous. Lastly, I would say just try to distract yourself for a bit until it passes. I hope this helps you!",

Being really consistent about drinking water. \n2. Give yourself extra time in the morning to get ready so you can move slowly.\n3. Lay out everything you need for the morning the night before (clothes, makeup, stuff to bring to work, food, etc.) so you can wake up feeling like you\u2019ve already made some progress. It helps with having a positive mindset which in turn helps with the nausea.",

I get head rushes, especially when I stand up from a sitting position, and when I do activities that require some physical dedication . I also experienced very fast heartbeat.

        "body": "Short version my girlfriend (21f) broke up with me (21m). We had a great relationship, she said I have treated her the best out of anybody else she\u2019s been with, she said she dreamt of walking down the aisle to me. I thought everything was going well. Then she pulled the plug out of nowhere because she didn\u2019t want to talk about what was bothering her. She lied to me several times during the breakup and then told me the truth later on. After we broke up I had a moment of weakness and cut myself for the first time in 2 years. We got back together and talked about it, she agreed she should have talked about what was bothering her first. She then saw my cuts (I tried to hide them bc I was ashamed) and she then broke up with me again. She said she can\u2019t handle that. We talked more after a couple days and decided to just take a month or more to work on ourselves and then reconvene and see if we want to try again. We both cared for each other. Roughly a week ago she came to me and showed me that she cut herself, she cut a lot. I didn\u2019t give up on her and took care of her. She then stopped responding to me and it really scared me. Three days ago she called and said she wants me to move on. \n\nShe said she has a lot going on in her life, she said her alcoholic dad started drinking again. She said she might get kicked out of college because they think she cheated on tests. She said she lost some friends because they confessed their feelings for her. She said she lost some other friends because they were spreading lies about her. \n\nTwo days ago she called again and said she really wants me to move on. She said she is thinking of being a nun, and that she will never marry a non catholic man (I\u2019m Christian, we didn\u2019t talk about it but I would have consider becoming catholic). She has put me through a lot, I\u2019m about 95% sure I never want to see her again but 5% of me still misses her. \n\nMy mother thinks she is a narcissist and thinks that she makes nothing her fault. All of my friends think I dodged a big bullet. All I really know is that she hurt me a lot and put me through a lot.\n\nI have noticed my anxiety has gotten a lot worse. I have gotten roughly 3 panic attacks a day (normally <1 a month for me). I\u2019m guessing I\u2019m more anxious because I was so blind sided but I\u2019m not sure. I am trying therapy in a couple days (earliest I can get in). Does anybody have any advice that could help me before therapy, everything is difficult. I only feel sick, numb, sad, or hollow. My normal hobbies don\u2019t seem interesting and I\u2019m not sure what to do. Thank you in advance for any advice.",

I said they were stuck up to them. However , I like one of the girls but I said they were stuck up because the other girl had an argument with my friend so I was just sticking up for her. \nNow I\u2019m sober it\u2019s playing on my mind because one of them is my friend and it looked like I was calling them both stuck up plus usually I never say anything bad about anyone but I said it in front of them all and there will be crossed wires about it. Because of my OCD this stuff plays on my mind and I have to take action to try and get validation and make myself feel better. So today , after 5 days I messaged both of the guys and said \u201c on Saturday I didn\u2019t mean both of the girls were stuck up I just said it meaning one of them because she had an argument with my friend \u201c and now it\u2019s made me feel even worse because they replied saying they didn\u2019t even remember and why am I saying this now and getting worried over it. So now I am embarrassed and it\u2019s made my thoughts even worse than before I said something because they didn\u2019t remember anyway and now I\u2019ve reminded them! To make it worse they know the girls and know that I know the girls too so I\u2019m getting stressed and feeling like I look sly and now I\u2019m embarrassed because I look like a weirdo for messaging them and the thoughts are just all stuck in my head!",

Well 8 months ago I suffered a concussion that triggered panic attacks and anxiety (along with a bunch of other concussion symptoms). Now I'm concussion symptom free but still have increased anxiety. Panic attacks now are more mental and a bit of an adrenaline rush. Also I know when I'm anxious because I just feel \"weird\" and \"off\". They seem to come in waves and seem random. \n\nIm doing CBT, learning to not fight the anxiety, and accept this new feeling. I have tried Zoloft for two months and that was awful for me. So I rather be med free. I feel the old me is in there slowly coming back but it's so defeating when the wave of anxiety hits.\n\nThings have improved but slowly. I guess my question is, has anything helped you overcome anxiety? Experience anything like this? Did you return to your old self? (I also recognize asking this and looking for reinsurance probably isn't helpful lol) ",

Been struggling with anxiety for 3 years now\n\nWhen it started I couldn\u2019t even go for a walk cause I thought I\u2019d have a heart attack\n\n3 years later I\u2019m running 10-15 kilometres per run \n\nSo today was running day, I started feeling not very strong. My mind started doubting that I\u2019d be able to finish. And when my mind gives up my body starts to shut down and bad thoughts come in. It had happened before 3-4 months ago in one of my runs. I started feeling dizzy and thought I was going to have a heart attack ( I was having a small panic attack). This lasted for like 30 seconds. I stopped for a minute to get my shit together and then started again \n\nThis time, I didn\u2019t stop and just kept going because I knew that my mind was playing games again. I just let the thoughts be and I relaxed. It was uncomfortable but I did it\n\nSo I\u2019m a bit confused,on the one side I feel proud that I didn\u2019t give in and stop. I handled it like a boss. But on the other hand I\u2019m little bit disappointed that I let these thoughts get in my head in the first place,cause I haven\u2019t had one of these episodes in my runs for 3-4 months now\n \nThe run was really hard and it was hot. So it\u2019s normal for my body it shut down a bit. \n\nWhat do you guys think. Is this a W OR L",

Start a few days before going out by lying down, getting totally relaxed and then  imagining that you are facing your fear. As soon as you are feeling anxious imagining this,  imagine you are out of that situation and get totally relaxed again. Once you are sure you relax, try it again. Try not to overthink or  analyze this. Each time you are sure you are totally relaxed put the tips of your thumb, index and middle finger together. Repeat several times a day. Once you are ready to do this for real, put your fingers together like this and your mind will automatically be trained to relax. You\u2019ve inadvertently trained your mind to get anxious in certain settings, here you are using that characteristic of your mind to your advantage. However, don\u2019t get too wrapped up in being relaxed. The way out of this is not by frantically looking to be relaxed, it\u2019s changing how you view this. Think long term. Even if it bothers you when you are anxious, be willing to endure these tests the rest of the time and rewrite the narrative. \u201cSay, no it wasn\u2019t that bad, I can take it\u201d and be prepared to do it again and take that plunge anyway. Say, \u201cI don\u2019t have to like it. I don\u2019t really need to avoid it, it\u2019s just unpleasant if I do avoid it, but I really shouldn\u2019t.  I can take it.\u201d",

Ant? Poison. \n\nMy irrational brain jumped to the conclusion that whatever he was putting down made it\u2019s way into the CLOSEZ fridge and sprinkled into my specific lunch box.\n\nI\u2019m aware I\u2019m in an anxiety spiral with about 2 weeks\nHalf of me wants to eat the lunch and NOTHING will happen, but the other half is like no don\u2019t do it go to the shop.\n\n",

        "body": "Hey everybody I just feel like ranting and also asking how y\u2019all deal with those symptoms. \nSo I Never really had anxiety in that way, I was always socially anxious which got better with time, but since 2021 it all turned so bad. \nI\u2019m an optimist and usually quite enjoy life and take every challenge as it comes, always looking for the good thing. But with this.. legit it makes life unbearable sometimes. I feel like I\u2019m not even existing, I\u2019m in constant surviving mode trying to breathe and come trough night and day. And also I feel like most people don\u2019t really get what I\u2019m going through. I struggle with breathing sometimes everyday, having air hunger and chest pain. My arm or hand going numb, dizziness. Insomnia. It\u2019s like I never get a pause. It\u2019s always kind of there. Someday just like really strong. \nIn 2023 I started therapy and i guess it got a bit better. I assume I only had like real bad anxiety when there was a full moon coming or idk some special event. But then to the end of 2023 life was extremely exhausting and since then I struggle again more frequently. I figured that my anxiety goes up when I drink alcohol so right now I\u2019m not drinking and checking if it changes something, but since I quit smoking weed in 2022 this is my only escape out of reality. And no I don\u2019t drink often but from time to time it was quite regularly to put my mind at ease and just bc everything makes more fun with it Idk.. nice distraction. Sorry if this is a little all over the place, imma just bomb y\u2019all with all my thoughts. \nI can\u2019t sleep without hearing music or a movie in the background. The last nights I even struggle so badly that I dream from been very anxious and breathing really uncomfortably and then waking up doing so. Calming down just seems impossible. Literally I tried so many things even got medicine. It won\u2019t help. But everybody expects me to function. And \u201efunctioning\u201c is really hard and exhausting for me. I can\u2019t get shit done, I lowkey throw my life always bc I\u2019m turning 23 and I still don\u2019t know where to go with my life. But how am I supposed to figure my future out when I\u2019m constantly figuring out how to come through my day. \nMy anxiety is really scary, I\u2019m not necessarily afraid to die but sometimes I lay in bed and feel like I won\u2019t be able to breathe, so I Spirale. Agh idk, so yeah I\u2019m trying to figure this out and I\u2019m open for new tips. \n\nWell thanks if anyone is reading this, and also thank you for creating a space like this, where a random person from Belgium can dump their shit lol\n\n",

I fear what they are thinking. Im sure they are like why is she even bothering She is so average anyway. I feel like throwing up and screaming into the void but my voice is stuck in my throat. I don't wanna say it but my chances of getting in are so low as well. I want to stay optimistic and believe in that ray of hope, but realistically idk. maybe ill just apologise to my lecturer for not living up to their expectation.",

I think you applying is a good achievement in and of itself, and the fact you got an LOR from your lecturer means they saw potential in you and that they don't think you're \"just average\" or \"have nothing to bring to the table\". I think you may just be getting cold feet or maybe you're just putting yourself down, but you shouldn't doubt yourself. No matter what happens, the fact you tried and put in the effort is a great thing. Try not to think so negatively about not living up to your lecturer's expectations, you're already surpassing their expectations if they're writing an LOR for ya. Don't beat yourself up, you're obviously talented and smart.",

However I have been taking the propranolol as needed, as prescribed, to help with my physical anxiety symptoms. Including the constant watch over my heart and how fast/ slow it\u2019s beating, palpitations, skipped beats etc. it was really consuming. However, recently I broke up with my girlfriend and when I go to sleep I get these insane rushes of adrenaline that jolt me up the second I fall asleep. And when I wake up, before I move or get up, it feels like I\u2019m about to have a full blown panic attack. Like the heart rate feels +100, can feel my face warming up, the whole works. But the second I get up it all goes away and I feel fine again. Then I\u2019ll try and sleep again after trying to shake the feeling off, and the second I start to fall asleep it happens all over again and I wake up with a racing heart. Anyone know what to do?

        "body": "Hey! I have someone very close to me who is experiencing very intense persistent anxiety and insomnia that came out quite suddenly and strongly, without any prior history of mental illness. During nights and days he feels deep hopeless, evenings are better. He is 32 years old. He did break up with a partner around the time the insomnia started (5 months ago) but says that this would be way too strong of a reaction to it. Is it normal that something like this starts so suddenly and strongly and to be so persistent to someone with no previous background? Did your anxiety 'start' suddenly or without a clear reason? Also, how can I make him feel better and more hopeful about healing? Right now he says he feels like he'll never get better. Thank you for your help!\n",

                "body": "For 6 years now...it never really goes away. If you have IBS like I do or other physical symptoms that localize in the chest area (ex: muscle aches in your pectorals or shoulder from anxiety tension), it can trigger panic.  Which it has done. Then, all bets are off as adrenaline takes over and drives you nuts. \n\n  \nCardiology is a well-developed field of medicine and a doctor who examines your heart in detail (ultrasound, EKG, etc.) can pretty much guarantee that you're OK. Blood chemistry tests are VERY sensitive and ultrasound can check for enlargement and valve problems. An EKG WILL reveal any abnormalities, especially a 24-hour halter EKG.  If you get those and an exercise test, you will definitely be clear.  I took photos of all my good test results with the doctor's diagnosis \"NO DISEASE OR ABNORMALITIES\" and keep it in a folder on my phone so I can look at it all the time. When I feel kind of weird, I immediately say \"This is my IBS, acting up\" and that keeps the panic away....your heart rate, if your heart is healthy, will vary not just from beat to beat but also with inhalation and exhalation. It's designed to do that. Other systems in your body will also send chemical or nervous system messages to your heart to request higher output for tasks (ex: the digestive system will request more blood to get digestion accomplished). This is all totally normal.  You can also think about the weird feeling...does it go away? If you actually have a heart issue, it NEVER goes away until it's dealt with. It won't happen for 30 min before your presentation then be totally fine afterwards. That's your nervous system asking the heart to do things because it feels tense. That is also normal and the heart is designed to handle ALL those requests. Think if it like a big diesel engine. You eat right, exercise, and sleep enough and it will run for 60-70 years without worry. \n\n  \nThe big problem is with people who routinely see odd heart cases (like, 1 in a million type) like me (I work in a hospital) and with the recent spate of sudden heart attacks in otherwise healthy people who have been injured by something that would get me banned from Reddit if I mentioned it but only since 2020. Constant exposure to that can undermine your internal sense of peace and make you really nervous. \n\n  \nI hope you can get a clear bill of health from a good doctor and then work on your internal reassurance. You CAN get well. It's a long process; I am still working on it myself, but you CAN get through it.",

And if I did anything remotely strenuous it would jump to like 215. By the time I manage to get in to see a cardiologist (which can take weeks) I\u2019m usually back to normal. I cant seem to catch it timing wise. I\u2019ve had an Echo, worn a halter, and had EKGs. Everything has come back normal. The ekg has recorded the elevated heart rate but my rhythm and everything was normal.  So who knows. I don\u2019t stress about it though. Maybe one day it will happen and I can get in quickly enough to capture something with a halter monitor. 97% of the time my heart rate is good (unless I\u2019m going through anxiety. I don\u2019t count that because I know the anxiety is causing that increase.) It\u2019s only those rare times when I feel like my legs are so tired and exhausted out of nowhere that I know something is off. Maybe one day the mystery will be solved.

I\u2019ve been diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder since I was a young 20 something in college and since then, I keep getting diagnosed with this, twice after the first. I\u2019m sure there are underlying issues with me, it\u2019s just too much trouble right now to find help from Kaiser Permanente. Their mental health team is godawful. Had my psychiatrist and therapist dump me after a year of them not remembering important facts about me. Like my name.\n\nMy job right now requires me to talk a lot. It\u2019s great I do love it, something about talking sparks energy into me. I get so excited I have to talk and go on tangents when it gets slow. Unfortunately I over share and I have a difficult time lying. I can\u2019t stop myself and what\u2019s worse, my coworkers encourage it. They egg me on probably because they\u2019re bored, or they\u2019re doing it to make fun of what I said after. I hope not but sometimes I see their eyes shift towards each other and I only notice it later, during my afternoon commute. My GAD does cause paranoia so I doubt myself sometimes but still.\n\nThere was also a coworker two years ago who complained to my boss and HR that I was too much (yet he would engage with me). That I was childish. One day he had his phone out facing up and while he asked me for help, I accidentally read his text making fun of me \u201comg another pointless conversation.\u201d and I knew it was about me. And there were other moments too, straight up being two faced. This man broke me inside and out. After two years, even after he left, I don\u2019t seem to get better, even with new colleagues I just have to talk and talk.\n\nMy bitter feelings about where I work, our shit pay, the betrayal I felt about management screwing us over during the pandemic keeps surfacing more and more. I know eventually I will get into more trouble so I\u2019m trying to find a new job or career. Like it sounds crazy but I desperately want to move to another state just to leave myself behind and become a quieter person. I want to be that person so badly just not knowing anyone, where I can\u2019t bother them.\n\nI hope someone relates, I know it sounds crazy but it\u2019s true. Would it help me to get diagnosed with something that\u2019s not GAD? Is there a technique I can do to keep me from over sharing? Well if someone relates, I hope you\u2019re okay.\n\n\n",

If you believe you might have other underlying Mental conditions, theres absolutely nothing wrong with doing some research on some other mental health conditions and talking to a trusted doctor. \n\nI for years went misdiagnosed as well, first it was anxiety, then depression, then both. I kept getting random anti anxiety meds and ssri\u2019s thrown at me to shut me up and get me out of the Drs office, and all of them made things worse for me. I definitely suffer anxiety, but I had a feeling for years I had something else.. Found out more about ADHD a couple of years ago, and BAM\u2026 Finally found a good doctor willing to help me, and I got diagnosed with ADHD & C-PTSD late last year.",

I agree and I wish my insurance could provide better mental health services, they just throw ssris at me and nothing really works. I also think they switched me around pills so fast that it broke something too, there were no transition periods between Lexapro, Wellbutrin, and the dreaded Effexor. Before those I took like Paxil, Citalopram etc and they only helped my depression. I will try again with Kaiser and explain my situation with them and advocate for myself more. Also I did take the ADHD test but they only cared about risky behavior, I suspect I have ADHD and Autism so that could be why I failed it. Well thank you so much for listening too, I appreciate you so much!"

To make things difficult, my tolerance for caffeine fluctuates and I'm currently at a point where I can barely drink half a cup of coffee without feeling agitated and anxious.

I just get turbo-anxiety with too much caffeine and it's miserable.\n\nAbsolutely recommend cutting back, either drinking less or going with half-caf blends.

I used instant coffee and gradually decreased how much of it I scooped in each day until the whole bottle was out. Then I switched to black tea until I drank the whole box, then green tea, then making the green tea and pouring out half. Then I switched to herbal tea to maintain the nice feeling of a hot drink in the morning. No headaches, and my anxiety is markedly improved :)",

I didn't grow up with any other family, siblings, or friends. She's in her 50s and has ME/CFS, where the average death age is in one's 50s. She has other health problems and also smokes. I'm so terrified of her dying. I have anxiety attacks about it every day, along with other things. I refuse to live in a world where she is not there and I have plans not to. \n\nUsually, people would just say to \"cherish the time\" and \"make memories\" and \"remember the good times you have had with her.\" But it's actually really annoying. I know that's the only logical thing to do, but I'm venting, not looking for logical answers.\n\nI can't remember. My memories of growing up have mostly disappeared because of my mental health, and my mental health gets worse day by day, so I know I will continue to lose more memories. I can't even remember what I did yesterday. At all. Let alone what I did with my mom. I am so exhausted from anxiety every day that I never have time or motivation to do anything with her anyway. If we go out anywhere, I am not mentally there. It's like watching a movie and the audio is muffled. I'm always in my head, full of fear, so it's not like I even make memories now. \n\nI know I love her. I love her so much I start crying thinking of her. But why? Why do I love her? I don't remember why. \n\nFuck chronophobia, fuck c-ptsd, fuck depression, fuck me/cfs. Taking the only person  I have ever loved away from me. ",

        "body": "Okay, semi long read incoming. Also not English native speaker\n\nI used to work as a middle manager for about 5 years up until 2023. In my 5th year, I started to lose control over some parts of my job, causing a panic attack that lead into some kind of burn out. I was pretty unhappy there anyway, so I quit. I had 6 months off and then got asked for a comparable job at another office.  I first wanted to say no, but I figured it couldn't hurt to just try it. 4 months in and I am feeling the same panic/anxiety as I felt before.\n\nNow to be clear, I visited a psychologist for this in 2023. I had about 10 sessions and the conclusion was that I was gifted, which\nmade a lot of sense after reading into it. I mostly struggle hard when I have responsibility over stuff I cannot fully control. I also struggle hard when things don't have a head and a tail. I need to finish things, not work in a continuous loop. \n\nI quit my job once again cause I started to feel the same panic as last year. I'm okay-ish, but on edge of a panic attack, nervous and extremely disappointed in myself. My plan for now is to get some rest and get a simple job (as in, no pressure, no real responsibilities). I know where my panic/anxiety comes from and I hope that avoiding those situations will help me a lot.\n\nI wonder what your experiences are when you got away from the environment that leads to panic attacks and anxiety? Did you feel like your old self quickly? Was it like you 'snapped out of the anxiety '? \n",

        "body": "my name is Lillie and im 17 and I would really like to hear opinions from other people about my problem.\nJust for information, I've been diagnosed with anxiety when I was 8 and I have received therapy before. \nLast September I formed a romantic connection with a guy (it didn't last btw lol) but during that time I found myself feeling so anxious to the point where I was vomiting EVERY SINGLE DAY for two weeks straight in the morning as soon as I woke up. This was so damaging to me and my health, I lost a lot of weight too. He ended up ghosting me anyway and the vomiting went away but I did get put on Phenergan (anti vomiting meds) but this didn't help and they changed it to Cyclizine.\n\nfast forward a month or so and I'm talking to a new guy but I've known him for like 2 years, he lives not far and we met up. We smoked weed and I ended up greening out and throwing up a lot but apart from that my anxiety wasn't so bad. He comes back the next day to see me and my anxiety is awful again, we watch a movie and I threw up 5-6 times (in like 15 minutes intervals) throughout the movie. \na week or so later I meet up with him and we are in a shopping centre and I throw up on myself in public and it was so embarrassing, I didn't know my way around anywhere and couldn't find a toilet. he was really nice to me and understanding but we also stopped talking.\n\nthis is the third time now, I've been really interested in this guy since January and we both like eachother, we meet up every Thursday with our friends and my anxiety has been ok and I haven't thrown up but the past few days it's coming back, I'm waking up with horrible anxiety and I'm struggling a lot to take public transport too, I stopped taking Cyclizine a few months ago but have gone back to taking it as I'm so scared to be sick. I really think I need to go on anxiety medication, does anyone else experience the same thing as me? ",

Before that, I had finished CBT therapy and finally felt that my anxiety was under control (as in I'd still get anxious, but I now had the tools to acknowledge how I was feeling and dealing with it).\nSince getting my IUD, apart from other side effects such as abdominal pain, severe bloating, etc. I feel that my anxiety has gone so much worse, the techniques I learned in therapy no longer suffice and the shortness of breath and chest pains are back. I tried explaining this to my GP who said I was probably overreacting and needed to let my body adjust to the IUD for a few months before feeling like \"myself\" again. \n\nDid this happen to any of you, and if so did it get better? I can't really see myself dealing with this anxiety peak again for months hoping that my body adjust to it :(",

Alternatively, some people are naturally more resilient to stressful situations, like not even percieving being busy or talking to strangers as something to stress over! But we are all different beings, with different sensitivities. \n\nIt's very easy to feel frustrated when the people around you don't have to go through the shit that 24/7 anxious-riddled people have to go through. The best thing you can do is turn inwards, and find ways (therapy, medication etc) that can help you better manage yours. That feeling of being chill and relaxed all the time can be yours as long as you are patient with yourself, and you aren't alone :).",

Draw boundaries with your friends/boyfriend that you cant be around them when theyre smoking or have smoked. Have them try to air out places you\u2019ll be if it smells like weed.

If you feel like things are getting worse then they were before the meds then call your doctor back and tell them that. Therapy would help but your situation needs to be addressed ASAP because your quality of life seems dismal. Try for a psychiatrist who can diagnose you because sometimes PCPs don\u2019t know everything when it comes to diagnosing and treating mental illnesses. I know insurance can be a bitch but do some research or even ask questions on other subreddits about it to find ways to make it affordable. Even if it\u2019s expensive it\u2019s worth it for your sanity! \n\nI\u2019d ask your BF for more support. It can be hard for a partner to hold space sometimes but he should help you best he can. As well as your friends, have you reached out to them for support? Obvi you can\u2019t tell them to stop smoking but I\u2019d hope they don\u2019t do it when you\u2019re around out of respect because good friends wouldn\u2019t do that (maybe they can do it before you hang out). \n\nKeep posting here all you want! It\u2019s cathartic to vent to others who know the pain you\u2019re going through. If it\u2019s any comfort, you are fine. Your food is not being drugged, that\u2019s irrational thinking. No one is trying to poison you. You CANNOT get high from merely smelling weed. You\u2019re feeling a placebo effect at most. Keep eating your safe foods if that makes you feel better and there\u2019s no shame in falling asleep to movies that calm you. I like putting on \u201crain storm on window\u201d podcasts when falling asleep. I\u2019m really sorry you\u2019re struggling so much right now and I hope things get better for you <3",

High intensity sometimes made me feel worse, but walking calmed me down and got me to a place of peace.\n\nBut now, even just going for a 60 minute walk leads to psychological symptoms like anxiety and depression. \n\nIt's like my body doesn't want me to do any long term physical activity. I'm not afraid to exercise. When this first started I was looking forward to my hiking holiday as it usually brings me peace, but I was having panic attacks during the night.\n\nI thought it was just me having a mental break down until I noticed that my symptoms were building up as I was engaging in physical activity. Since I stopped hiking or jogging, I've had no panic attacks at all.\n\nSo I thought I may have just been pushing myself too hard, but it's literally just 2-3 mile walks that are doing it.

Most of the other students are falling behind. My big assignments are supposed to take 2 weeks to do so basically I have until this time next week to get ahead so I can spend more time on the final assignment for each class.

                "body": "You got this! I know it's easier said than done but don't panic. I usually like to start with the assignment that gives me the most anxiety, to get it out of the way as soon as possible. How about you? I know some people prefer to start with the easiest one first. If you can handle multiple assignments at the same time, even better. The most important thing is to start. Starting really is half the battle. Please don't look at everything you have to do and just worry about it. If starting is difficult, then try to work on it for at least 15 min, and you'll see, you might actually find the motivation to work on it for hours. You said it yourself, you're on track. That's already a good sign. You can do it! You have managed up until now. It's most likely going to be tough, but once it's over, you'll be so proud of yourself, I think it's worth it. Don't give up now, you're doing well :)",

I have also inherited my families lineage genetic Bipolar disorder in my late teens but am proud to say that in the last year with a combination of medication and help from doctors I can say for the first time in years that deep depression and unstable highs are no longer a part of my life. But Anxiety is still there, every minute of every day. Being not depressed has made me realize how it is effecting my life: My friendships are completely based on alcohol, I have no social skills sober and sitting in a college lecture makes me sweat and shake. Every decision I make is based on fear. I feel like my life is wasting away in front of me and I want it to change. \n\n**My goal this year is: Treat my anxiety disorder and Improve social skills**\n\nIm aware how broad and ambitious this goal is. My question is has anybody set a new years resolution or any resolution surrounding this? if so what were your metrics for success, what were your steps to get there and did you achieve it? I feel like this is the year I can beat this I just don't know how to start.\n\nIm sure there's already a question like this but a response would be awesome.",

                "body": "A good goal should include your target (be very specific), how you will measure this/how you will know that this is achieved. Also your goal should be achievable, relevant to what you want.   \nSo a good specific goal for you broader goal (to treat anxiety) could look like:   \nI will notice the incoming signs and emotions preceding a panic attack or anxiety, using journaling and introspection, with a success rate of XXX, in any environement.   \nI personnally like this goal because it opens up new possibilities to find out what your more subtle triggers and what makes you feel good/not bad in general. And it will help you figure out a panic attack is coming so you can possibly avoid it. If you already know the signs, maybe your goal could be to find techniques to bring yourself down like the 5-4-3-2-1 technique or taking deep breaths (your exhale should be a couple seconds longer than your inhale, otherwise you're just hyping yourself up) or painting at the end of a particularly bad day.   \n   \nAnother goal could look like:   \nI will improve my social skills by trying a new hobby with a structured social component (examples: social dancing, board games, debated team, bookclub etc) and speaking at least once during every gathering.  \nScructured social stuff really helped me get out of my shell and learn social skills. For me it was dancing and then improv and then writer's club.   \n\n\nI think it's really cool that you're sober. I wasn't an alcoholic before but I became sober ever since I figured out that any drugs, alcohol or even coffee really brings my anxiety to crippling new heights.",

I'm taking care of my sick little guy and we nearly lost him twice. I've already grieved him during vet procedures that he wasn't supposed to make it out of (having him survive both times was incredible but also a shock) and we're having to check on him several times throughout the night. They're so incredibly fragile. My reassurance seeking is through the roof but also combined with unusual behaviour (obviously! because he's sick!) is frying my nerves.\n\nThankfully a family member offered to care for him today. I spent the past 12 hours locked in a room unable to get out of bed. I'm barely taking care of myself and I'm so overwhelmed. I'm so burnt out I can't even cry. Just constant terror and nausea and it won't let go of me.\n\nI feel like I'm too scared to hope for anything good to happen-- like what if I jinx it somehow? but that doesn't make any sense. I feel like I'm living in an alternative universe. Every normal routine feels wrong and out of place. I feel like I'm losing my mind.\n\nthanks for listening :(",

It was traumatizing, I woke up to her having a seziure fit and the entire day was spent waiting for doctors to check on her, and then finally I had to send her to the vet to be hospitalized for 3 days. \n\nI remember the doctor listing down the consent form to send my dog there and the moment they started saying \"Due to it being a severe case...\" etc, saying how death can be likely, I just broke down then and there in the vet's room. Like my mind already believed she was dead already.\n\nComing back, I had the worst panic attack of my life. It felt like 3-4 panic attacks in a row and lasted 3 hours. I even called the ambulance.\n\nFor the next month, my time was spent recovering both myself and my dog. When she started getting better, I did too.\n\nIt's an awful experience, and you're not alone. Your pet is a family member, so it makes sense that you feel this way. It's even tougher because we don't really know what's going through our pet's head during this, and we can only trust the vet's opinion. \n\nI highly recommend talking to someone, a therapist if you have one. Try reaching out to your friends and family and tell them about it.\n\nConsidering your bunny has gone through 2 nearly-fatal events (what a trooper!), focus on giving him the best days as much as you can. I'm extremely lucky that my dog survived, and I consider the time I have with her \"extra time\" so to speak, so I've been focusing on doing everything she loves, and hanging out with her a lot more.",

To her credit, she goes to therapy, is on Buspirone, and has not been avoiding the things that bring on panic attacks, e.g. flights and hiking. However, it hasn't seemed to have gotten any better, and any time we're getting deep in the woods she freezes up and can't go any further. Same with flights, every time we fly it's a day long, exhausting battle to get through it. This is hard for me, because I want to be able to do the things I love with the person I love, and her anxiety is making them almost unbearable. \n\nI love her, and I try to do my best to understand and to be there present, but truth is I have no idea what she's going through or how to help. We've been having some communication issues and fights lately, and when I brought up how I feel a little limited in my hobbies by her anxiety, it destroyed her. \n\nSimilarly, in the past I asked her about what would happen if we had a child and I was away for a weekend. What if a panic attack set in? Would she still able to care for our child? I thought these were valid questions but she took great offense to this. \n\nSo I guess my question is, how do I address my concerns without offending her? Any advice is appreciated. ",

I am extremely nervous after previously trying sertraline and having unbearable side effects. I have anxiety-induced insomnia already so I\u2019m really scared that I\u2019m going to get zero hours of sleep for the next few days. I know it takes a few weeks to see benefits but I\u2019m really nervous about not sleeping because I already don\u2019t sleep, but my depression and anxiety are at an all time low. I have high heart rate and shake a lot. Please share! ",

                "body": "I\u2019ve been on Lexapro for I think 2 years now. When I first took it, my anxiety was bad and out of control. I was scared to do anything. So I believe this is why I had a bad first experience with Lexapro (10mg). I tried it again a few months later after hearing my friend say good things about it. Of course, I was anxious about trying it again. But the thing I\u2019ve come to learn about anxiety is that you have to face your fears. After speaking to my doctor we both agreed to start on a low dose. (My body is sensitive to medications/ I don\u2019t like taking medications, only if I have to). So I started with 2.5mg by cutting a 5mg pill in half. First week or 2 my side effects were being tired and a bit of nausea. After that my side effects subsided and I was normal. I would take the Lexapro on an empty stomach to avoid the nausea. After a while that went away and I\u2019m able to eat whenever. My anxiety levels went down to a point where I can manage my anxiety myself with the help of meditation, exercising, breathing techniques, etc\u2026 2 years later I am now on 12.5mg. About every 6 months or so my anxiety creeps back up and when I can\u2019t manage it on my own, I go up on the dosage. Every time I went up on the dosage I will get the tired side effects for a week or 2 and it goes away.",

My jaw is painful from clenching, I'm exhausted, my ears are ringing and I had the worst time concentrating today. 10/10 godawful day for no reason. A huge contrast with the past week when I felt great.\n\nAm I stupid for wanting to beat this without meds? Or is there a pathway to a life where I learn to manage these days as well and they get less severe?

Currently sitting at 129bpm after one small glass for sipping. If it ain't one thing it's another cashing me anxiety, it doesn't make sense as 90% or people say it brings anxiety down and is a bad habit but for me it's the complete opposite and I'm really upset this is happening because I enjoy my whiskey at the end of the day coming home and pouring a glass up.

                "body": "You\u2019re not alone. This has happened to me over the last 3-4 months, specifically with craft beer. I will say I\u2019ve had anxiety for a while at least 3-4 years but finally acknowledged it within the last 6 months since it got out of control. I used to run a YouTube channel, I was in the local bottle shop every other day picking out the latest limited release IPA etc. Now I get anxiety about drinking because I believe it\u2019s the root cause of what was a slew of panic attacks over the last few months. My panic attacks were over heart issues, (thinking I was going to have a heart attack or some sort of impending doom, similar to you, increased heart rate). I would drink anywhere from 1-3 beers a night over a period of time but it has been a staple in my life for a long while. Same with cannabis, but cannabis was causing the same thing first and (I\u2019ve been smoking since I was 13 now 32) quit cold turkey about 4 months ago. The anxiety it gave me when I smoked was so easy to quit. Can I ask what is triggering the anxiety behind the thought of drinking? Is it the act of drinking which is causing anxiety? Is it if I drink this\u2026.. will my heart rate will shoot up and something bad will happen? I feel for ya! It\u2019s not fun. I did dry January that helped, then slowly eased into it. Granted I did see a psychiatrist who did put me on a low dose of klonopin to take when needed. I will say this has helped big time, although you\u2019re not supposed to drink on benzodiazepines so I have to be careful (even though my Psych said it\u2019s fine, guy is out of the wild Wild West lol). What\u2019s helped the most is a therapist. Talking to someone is huge. I would also recommend exercise, a gratitude journal just for some self reflection. Sorry for the long story, I hope some insight here helps, it\u2019s super frustrating and a conundrum.",

I've given up regular weed as well because the panic it induces so I smoke type 2 and 3 hemp (type 2 is CBD/THC and type 3 is pure CBD) idk what I'd do without it because it's all that calms me down without having to take a Xanax.

This year he started full time kindergarten and for the first few months he was totally fine (his sister is in 4th grade same school) until he broke his ankle on trampoline and stayed home for a month with home teacher.  Even after that break from school he was fine for a week but one day suddenly he started crying and complaining about long school hrs his words \" 7 hrs school is a joke\". \"My life is just school n weekend,school n weekend\". Sometimes he starts worrying about school and asks about each n every detail in the morning including weather ( cloudy days bother him after he developed school anxiety). Nowadays he is very anxious in the morning and throws up whatever we give him in the morning even water. He also does not eat his lunch most of the time. We have tried our best to counsel him at home ,tried bribing him of his favorite toys but it doesn't work. He is a bit fearful right from the start. Never like changes , a picky eater,never  try new things so easily and always very careful about surroundings, scared of going to doctor .  I am at loss. He had no birth defects of any sort except me as a father also experienced anxiety and depression during my teenage and was not a happy kid. We are concerned about his physical health and mental condition. I know how it feels being anxious and overthinker. On the other hand he is a social kid and easily mingles with everyone quite easily. Any advise would highly be appreciated. ",

It\u2019s an amino acid found in green tea that can reduce jitters from caffeine, but some people even find it helpful for anxiety on its own. \n\n 2. Caffeine mints or gum. The caffeine in these is mainly absorbed through your gums/mouth so they tend to hit stronger than caffeine that you drink. That may be bad for your anxiety, but I actually find that it\u2019s way better for me because I need to take less. I feel enough of a boost after 40mg in mint form, meanwhile in the past I could drink 200mg in a drink and hardly feel an energy boost yet I was getting all of the anxiety symptoms that come along with it.",

But basically i keep thinking i am developing Peyronie's disease. Ill say that my thing has always and i mean always leaned left like i can stand strait and pee and it would pee left more lol. But after say masturbating it looks like it is so crooked? Like idk how to explain it, it look crooked until i fixed it. But when i am hard there is no like crookedness at all, or i think i am not even sure anymore. Its really bothering me. \n\nUnrelated to this i had to get a cystoscopy and ultra sound like in November and literally everything looked good. During the ultrasound they did inject with a needle to get hard, but it wouldnt go down after so the doc had to idk inject it again to make it go down, and when it was going down it looked crooked kinda how i see it now sometime, but after that it was good for so long until now?\n\nAm i overthinking it? Should i be worried? Is it just my anxiety? It doesnt hurt or anything and like i said when i get hard it still strait\u2026 i think or maybe the right side looked swollen?     ",

        "body": "hi all! i\u2019m f19, freshly diagnosed w anxiety abt 9 months ago.  my therapist is fantastic and he concluded that a big piece of my anxiety revolves around my job. \n\ni work in retail obv since i just got out of hs. and i work at a very small independently owned food place w only 7 employees. u heard me right. 7. \n\nit\u2019s hell on earth as everyone knows everyone and weirdly enough they\u2019re all fucking each other LOL. but anyways my coworkers have always been so unsupportive of me. i became the new favorite pretty fast as i had lots of work experience and was quick on my feet. (i worked for starbucks iykyk)\n\nbut my coworkers will target me personally and talk bad abt weirdly enough my bf. i\u2019m the only one in a relationship so it boggles me that anyone wants to talk rudely abt me or my bf. (they even joke abt my mother who has no legs and my boss finally told them to stop) \n\ni have a coworker who likes to praise how good he is at gaslighting and manipulating. (weird that it\u2019s somehow a flex to him) and for some reason he blocked me on everything recently. but it\u2019s impossible to ask him bc he says in quotes \u201cif i\u2019m ever mad at u i won\u2019t tell u why bc i\u2019m not good w my feelings so you\u2019ll have to tough it out.\u201d sir is 24 and acts this way. \n\nanother 24 yr old is the girl he\u2019s sleeping with and she CONSTANTLY pokes fun at me in front of the other male coworkers. (yes she\u2019s ALSO sleeping w the others) it\u2019s driving me crazy since it\u2019s my root of my anxiety but this job pays me very well i don\u2019t wanna leave. anxiety wise, what\u2019s my best solution?\n",

I'm constantly worried about if the physical training will be too much and I'll have a heart attack or something serious. likewise, I'm scared I'll get to a point where I'm so panicked that I'll have a heart attack. I know it's an irrational fear considering that I'm healthy. Usually I'll get so anxious in new situations that I'll work myself up to feeling like I'm going to pass out. I swear in March 5th and Ship out early May. I've wanted to join the military because I want to become more mentally strong and feel as though I need to accomplish more in life because l'm not too sure college is right for me. I will be extremely disappointed in myself if I don't do this. When I'm excited and happy Im a lot less anxious but seeing everyone talk about how scary Reception is has started to scare me. Is it possible for me to do without quitting and how I can calm myself down? Does anyone have any advice on these issues? ",

I think that\u2019s just generally the sensation I get with a sedative. \n\nI know it\u2019s a game charger for a lot of people and I truly only need it for flying. But something about taking it and then having labored or slow breathing on an airplane for hours is so scary to me. \n\nAnyone have similar experiences with a fear of medication?",

This never happened before. \n\nI can't do this anymore. I'm scared when it's raining, I'm scared when it's not raining. And scientists are now saying that it's just getting worse?

                "body": "Climate change IS scary. I'm terrified of what it will mean in the coming decades. I'm terrified we're not moving fast enough. My emotions get the best of me at times, and bad climate news is devastating to me. I get nauseated and get a pit in my stomach. So I try to avoid reading the mainstream news. I'm not saying to ignore the problems completely, but I don't seek out headlines. I totally understand how you're feeling.\n\nLogically, there's a ton of good happening in the world! There truly is. I seek out accounts that share good climate news. Sam Bentley, Alaina Wood, and Jacob Simon are great follows. \n\nThere honestly is SO MUCH being done to combat the problem around the world! The Paris Agreenment back in 2014 has already steered us away from an absolute worst case scenario, iirc. In the US, we've got the Environmental Protection Agency, and rivers are no longer on fire. Solar and wind are becoming cheaper than coal all over the world, and it's simply more economical to move to renewables. More countries are running 100% on renewable for longer periods of time. Electric vehicles are on the rise. Countries are banning short flights when trains are available. Refill stores are growing in popularity. Plastic bag bans are working. Countries are banning single use plastics. There are so many animal conservation and rewilding efforts happening all over the world. The EU just passed a law to restore their land. Seas are being protected. There really are a ton of good things happening around the world, but they're not sexy, attention-grabbing headlines. I just saw a headline that 1 in 5 cars sold worldwide in 2023 was EV, and that's curbed the demand for oil. TWENTY PERCENT of all cars all over the world. That's no small number. \n\nI know companies are responsible for the majority of emissions, but I do believe that people can make a difference too. Many of those companies exist because we're buying from them and stuff is being shipped all over the world. There is power in large numbers. So I try to do what I can. I try to shop secondhand first rather than buying new. When I go on walks, I pick up trash along the way so it doesn't harm wildlife or make it to the water. I'm trying to eat more vegan meals because animal agriculture, especially beef, is a huge contributor to global warming. I look at it as not taking away meat, but adding tons of delicious meals to my diet. I'm trying to live more sustainably (reduce how much I buy, reuse what I can, trying to compost). I'm one person. One person might not make a difference. But what if I inspire someone to make changes in their life, and they inspire someone? What if everyone tried a hell of a lot harder to consume less when possible and try more vegan meals and walk or bike if they can? I think millions of people being more conscious of their sustainability, even if it's imperfect, could move the needle and make the planet better. \ud83d\udc99 \n\nMaybe this is all naive, but there is a lot we can do and that is being done.",

I chronically clench my jaw so my entire jawline is sore. I throw up when I become too anxious, which in times of bad anxiety can be multiple times a day. I sleep with my arms in the t-Rex position and I have daily wrist and joint pain. Frequent chest pain and shortness of breath. Stomach aches followed by diarrhea. On any given day I have at least 3 of those symptoms. My anxiety actually used to be worse than this before medication, but I can now at least function in my daily life (Im a graduate student, doing very well in school, etc.). I\u2019ve also visited doctors and been checked out for every illness you can imagine - it\u2019s simply anxiety causing this. \n\nAnd don\u2019t get me wrong, I know anxiety is not a terminal illness and I am much much more fortunate than many to go to the doctor and find out that I\u2019m not dying\u2026..but at the same time, it\u2019s insanely frustrating to know that there is nothing wrong with you and your body is choosing to sabotage itself.",

Long hot showers are a must when I\u2019m going through it. A hot bath with some ambient sounds or music playing is also really helpful for me. Snuggling my dog and drinking hot chamomile chai tea.

I used to notice a better \"waking up\" (lasts hours for me) with Vyvanse but it takes too long for full effect so now I take Ritalin and it works in 20 mins. \nI just have it on my nightstand and take it as soon as I awake and it helps in relieving anxiety and give me energy fast enough that I now don't waste whole mornings in that state of panic... \n\nI have ADHD but it does help with anxiety. \nI would really go for medication in your case, it's extreme and few \"tips and tricks\" can make a difference - pop a Valium or a Xanax (instant release) as soon as you wake up would be my advice but speak to your doctors of course.\nI've been there and I'm getting better but I still have some odd mornings where I wake up in a full panic and I still take Xanax as soon as I can reach for water.\n\nI'm so sorry, it seems you're really at an extreme level and besides medication I don't think there is much you can do to change your mornings - perhaps medication will start teaching your body not to go into full panic mode and you won't need them for long?\n\nSorry I can't be more helpful... I'm a therapist but after 20+ in treatment myself I know that sometimes nothing works as good as a pill :/ \n\nWishing the best for you",

I have been using alcohol to cope more than I should because it\u2019s like the only thing that takes my anxiety away. It numbs me and makes me enjoy life for a few hours. \n\nEvery night I don\u2019t drink I get massive spurts of anxiety, cannot fall asleep, and just lie in bed massively anxious until I give up and have a drink or two. Sleep aids, melatonin, etc. don\u2019t work for me. Benedryl works sometimes to just knock me out. \n\nWhat are some alternatives or tips for drinking less, but still fighting the anxiety? I\u2019m sick of the hangovers and I know it\u2019s not a healthy way to cope. But, I\u2019m currently lying in bed sober and incredibly anxious. I\u2019m not on any medications. My friends tell me to just replace alcohol with CBD/THC, but I don\u2019t want to replace one substance with another.",

In short, it's harder to eat, I'm losing weight (4 pounds in a week) my feet are sweaty, I'm constantly checking my symptoms and I'm getting really worried that something more might be going on. I went to my PCP, they ran blood and urine, checked diabetes, hormone levels, CMP, CBC, you name it. Basically, everything came up normal aside from some leukocytes in the urine. I've heard about the fight or flight response and was wondering if anyone else might have had similar symptoms. I feel like I'm losing my mind. My shoulders are always tight, my posture is horrible, breathing is shallow, I'm very sedentary, I don't exercise, diet isn't the best, but even with all these things it hasn't been as bad as this past week or so. Any advice or experiences like this? I could use some help.",

        "body": "So I recently stopped my antidepressant (lexapro) about 3-4 months ago due to having more ways of managing my anxiety. For context I am in college doing a graduate program and I\u2019ve been noticing recently that my heart starts pounding like crazy whenever I either have to present something in class or even if I raise my hand to speak. I have been on lexapro since before starting this graduate program and while on lexapro I never really experienced a racing heart simply for raising my hand to speak, and the presentation anxiety feels much more intense. My psychiatrist prescribed me propranolol to use as needed for before a presentation that might trigger this or if I think I might have a stressful class. Lexapro helped me a lot while I was on it but I don\u2019t like relying so much on medications so I was excited to handle things on my own. I also have Xanax as well that I can use as needed.\n\nThe propranolol sounds like it could be really helpful for presentation anxiety based on what I have read about how it works, however, I can\u2019t seem to get over the fear of taking this new medication (I\u2019ve never taken propranolol before). I know it\u2019s a BETA blocker that slows the heart rate and helps with the physical symptoms of anxiety which would be GREAT for these presentations, but considering some of my anxiety is related to health anxiety I have been over thinking this and worrying about it making my blood pressure too low or sending me into cardiac arrest, lol. My psychiatrist said to try it out at home when I\u2019m not expected to perform to see how it affects me but I can\u2019t shake this fear that it might hurt me or kill me. Have any of you taken propranolol before and what was the experience like ? Do you think I\u2019m over thinking and it\u2019s safer than I\u2019m making it out to be? If anyone has a career related to studying mental health medications that might be able to ease my fears that\u2019d be great too.\n\nTLDR: I was recently prescribed propranolol for presentation anxiety and I\u2019m afraid of the medication hurting me, anyone have experience with this medication that can ease my fears?",

Within 10-15 minutes, I feel completely normal but I take advantage of this and train my mind and body to relax and not depend on it. It does reduce my adrenaline, heart rate down from 120-70bpm. I have 120 tabs of it. I use it once a week. Only side effect is don't take it at night, it affects my sleep just a little but dreams are more vivid. This thing changed my life.

While parents can contribute to anxiety development through their parenting style, modeling behavior, and family dynamics, it's not accurate to say they are always the strongest factor. It's crucial to take a holistic approach to understanding anxiety development and consider various influences, including genetics, environmental stressors, trauma, and social support networks, when addressing and treating anxiety.",

It all stems from first the physical feelings of anxiety then my mind works backward from the physical so I think it is at least partially biological for me.

But she also has a history of depression so that probably didn't help! \n\nFor my sister, our parents were very enabling and still are 30 years later, so she's never grown and developed healthy coping habits, meaning she struggles to hold down jobs and live independently without constant bail-outs. For me, I was the odleat child so I had more pressure (good in a way, I am independent and doing okay in the grand scheme of things) but struggle with intrusive thoughts and feelings of lack of control still. I developed body dysmorphia as a teen due to my mum's immaturity (long story) and judgement, which has also never fully gone away, though is much better now.\n\nI'm due my own daughter any day now and I hope I can do better for her.",

I\u2019ll never be able to imagine how anxious she was. My adoptive parents kept that secret from me until my boyfriend at the time told me he knew I was adopted at 19. I also had a lot of issues with my adoptive parents. So both sets of parents were strong contributors, just one parent wasn\u2019t doing it intentionally.",

It was all day and an aching throb in my chest, couldn't sleep, cried all day finally went to the ER that night, they ran an EKG and heart monitor and everything was fine besides slightly elevated heart rate due to stress.\nThankfully, the day after this stopped after forcing myself to sleep through the night, but ever since then I've been sick. A longing ache in my chest, shortness of breathe, difficulty doing tasks, I've had aching radiating both left and right and sit in the middle of my chest. No jaw pain. Headaches sometimes.\nIt's gotten better, and somewhat manageable. I can go places again some days but other days all I can do is lay in bed.\nI have trouble sleeping, only get about 5-6 hours with a nap for another 3 after my morning tasks, and sometimes can't sleep because my \" heart \" ( middle of chest ) will ache badly. It gives me sleep anxiety.\nI've seen a therapist, and a doctor twice, all say it's anxiety. I'm 19 and afab and want to know is it really just that? Can an attack have lingering effects for weeks? Can I do anything to improve it? Stretches, medicine? The tightness in my chest is nearly constant with very brief sharp pains every now and then, and I just want it to stop. Any tips? \n\nEDIT: I have a known severe vitamin D deficiency that I'm currently working on with prescribed vitamins. Does this effect anything? ",

They said that I need blood work done, and I have an EXTREME fear of this. By extreme I mean that I have history of being aggressive towards doctors who tried to take my blood, and suicidal before or during the procedure. I have no idea what to do, the only time I was successfully able to get blood work was when I was at the psych ward. Would my therapist or psychiatrist be the best at helping me figure something out, or would the doctor who diagnosed me with the disease know what to do?

        "body": "This first happened in December of 2023. Brief history: I started smoking (marijuana) December of 2022, smoked for about 6 months and then traveled to Australia (where I took about a 4 month T-break), and immediately started smoking again come November 2023. I smoke daily. I only smoke indica biased hybrids, and indica. I rarely take edibles, and mainly smoke blunts and use my pen. \n\nAnyways this all started mid December. The first time it happened I was high. It was like there was another person in my head speaking another language. But, it is still MY internal monologue voice that I usually hear on a daily basis. It\u2019s really all gibberish. But it sounds like words. Like I said, it sounds like when you listen to someone speak a language you don\u2019t know. The words are flying through my head so fast that when I try and focus on one, to maybe try and verbalize what that \u201cword\u201d was, it\u2019s gone and there\u2019s new \u201cwords\u201d. The first time it happened, I was high. It lasted about 10-15 minutes. It didn\u2019t happen again for over a month, but when it did I was completely sober. Now it happens to me almost daily regardless of my intoxication. \n\nI can\u2019t describe it any better than gibberish in my head. I can\u2019t control it. I can\u2019t get out of it. I usually just sit and wait. It\u2019s very uncomfortable, but not scary or threatening. If anyone else has ever experienced this, PLEASE reach out. I struggle with pretty severe anxiety (which is why I smoke) and this is taking a toll on me. Oh and lastly, I stopped smoking 2 days ago and it has still happened since.  ",

While not too severe as the first time, it definitely is draining for me, as I'm sure most of you know. My doctor just prescribed 150mg of bupropione. I am kinda anxious about taking it and have not done so yet, as he said to give it a week. I have read a lot on this combination giving seizures and increased anxiety. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. My anxiety is causing just enough of an annoyance to mess up my mind and I am worried that it'll get worse.

Besides the emotional pain it causes, it also makes it hard to succeed professionally and financially.  \n\nWith my current education,  the only solid career I can get is a teacher. The problem is I'm socially anxious. So in seeking stability and work security, I would be exposed to a massive anxiety trigger.",

The answer is always better than how I\u2019m viewing/treating myself.\n\nIf I allowed myself to think so poorly of myself due to a mental health condition I did not ask for, I would be indirectly invalidating those with the same struggles.  Maybe not the best perspective but that\u2019s what helps me reframe my thinking. \n\nSelf-love is such an awkward concept for me. But what keeps me going is 1) I wouldn\u2019t want my loved ones to think they were failures if they were in my shoes and 2) I refuse to give up without a fight\u2014it\u2019s just rebellion and spite some days that keeps my spirit going.\n\nI was raised to determine my value based on my productivity and accomplishments. But we all have inherent value and are worthy of love. I don\u2019t always FEEL this way, but I KNOW it to be true.\n\nWhen the day comes when you finally have the house, the career, the car, your inherent value will not change. You were always deserving of love and good things.\n\nI struggle with social anxiety and small mistakes will have me spiraling for hours/days. Right now I use ChatGPT to help formulate responses to everyday conversation. It helps me build a foundation for social interactions because I was neglected and sheltered growing up. I\u2019m also trying to let myself try AND fail more at tasks because it\u2019s a part of learning. This is extremely hard because it\u2019s related to my career growth and the imposter syndrome is intense.\n\nYou have a good heart and good intentions. The world needs more people like you and me. You\u2019re not a loser. You\u2019re still here fighting. Even making this post is the little rebel in you fighting to survive. Keep going.",

I'm at the point where I'm literally, physically, pounding my head to convince myself to read an email. \n\nIt's not a panic attack, yet. I'm hoping it's not. I've had one from this job already. Went to the ER thinking it was a heart attack. Felt like it. Got treated. I started going to a therapist for it. But that's all out of the window right now. I can't remember any of my sessions at therapy. Just tried to talk to my husband about this just now. Then I heard him huff out in frustration from being interrupted, cause he's wfh too. So seeing that further fuelled my anxiety and so I drew back. I told him never mind even though I distantly heard him being apologetic for his initial reaction, but I retreated back to my home office and locked the door and told him to go away. \n\nI can't call my therapist. I can't call anyone else. This is stupid. I'm being stupid. I shouldn't be this anxious about reading an email. It's stupid. It's stupid. Just fucking read it. Read it. Read it. Read it. I'm trying to remember what my therapist told me. Something about coins? How much you want to invest on something? Or a river? I don't remember and it's making me even more useless. I don't know what my point writing this here is. I'm a fucking man. I'm a fucking adult. I just need to fucking grow up and read this God damn email. Just stop being fucking stupid. So stupid. So stupid. \n\nNo I'm not stupid. I'm not. I'm not. I want I think I'm not but it's making me think of all of this and how fucking stupid it is to feel this way and act this way and I can't fucking talk to anybody cause I'm fucking annoying to everyone and every thing. Just read the fucking email. There's no point to this. I have no fucking point. I'm fucking pointless. \n\nI'm writing this. And reading this. I can read this. Reading this is fine. I'm writing this. I can still think. It's there. I can't change that. It's already happened, I should think that that's fine. I need to stop thinking about what it could be. My feelings are already hurt. Am I going to get fired? Probably not. Writing stream of thought is good. I think swipe is helping. Cause typos happen or auto completion uses the wrong word and I have to be mindful to go back and edit my mistakes. Mistakes can be fixed. Like all these sentences. Like this post. It's ok. It's ok. Just read the email. It's ok. It's ok. I can talk about it next time I'm in therapy. Just breathe. It's ok. It's ok.",

I was having abdominal pains ,back and sum chest pains . I also have health anxiety to make things worse so I keep thinking something's wrong with me for example I have always thought I would have a heart attack or heart failure and recently I heard about ppls inside rupturing and since I have abdominal pain I think it's going to happen to me. I also keep thinking I might have a brain tumor or bleeding. \n\n\nNow I just wanted to ask is this anxiety and pains from drinking too much and throwing up. Also I take Prozac and haven't took it since Friday because I keep thinking my liver is going to fail or something. ",

I was prescribed Geodon 20 mg have been taking it for ten months but didn\u2019t see any changes. I was also prescribed Klonopin .5 daily. The Klonopin has definitely helped with the anxiety but I\u2019ve noticed that i am SO irritable and quick to anger now. \nSo I decided to stop taking geodon with a new psychiatrists advice. I stopped about ten days ago. And I also started taking .25 of klonopin nightly to ween off of that. This was two days ago. I feel like things have been decent. But today I\u2019m having a terrible day. The only way I can describe it is an overwhelming feeling of anxiety and uncertainty and unsettledness. I guess I\u2019m just wondering if anyone else has stopped these medications or tried to ween off of them and felt like this. It\u2019s horrible. ",

I feel less interested in being a huge support to everyone around me which has actually made my marriage better as I\u2019m more present with my husband, but my other friendships are suffering because I\u2019m pretty apathetic. I go to the gym regularly, take part in my hobbies, but only because I want to do them. \n\nAnd now I need to learn how to motivate myself outside of anxiety for the things I don\u2019t want to do.

Im confident but I'm trying my best not impose nor seen as trying to intimidate anyone at all which is counter-productive since now Im moving like a person learning how to walk again.

It\u2019s day 4 and I\u2019m having some horrible withdrawals which sounds crazy because I wasn\u2019t on it for that long.

Whether that be traveling to see friends and go to conventions, go out to movies/concerts/etc, or just hang out at friends houses.

I want to lie in bed with my laptop and turn my brain off. I look at my friends who want to chat and go out constantly and I feel so alienated from their perspectives. I just can\u2019t feel it. \n\nI take 10 mg Celexa daily but I\u2019m wondering if I should do something else. I\u2019m trying to make an appointment with my doctor but I\u2019m not sure where to start. Does anyone have any advice? ",

Granted, I've struggled with anxiety-related symptoms my whole life and I've been pretty stressed lately, so I know the odds are in her favor, but still, I'm curious if anyone can relate.\n\nI feel this thumping when I swallow. It comes and goes and is not consistent, nor does it hurt. It's just when I swallow it feels like a heavy thump in addition to the gulp that comes with swallowing. I don't otherwise feel any type of lump.\n\nAlso occasional, but my throat muscles get TENSE, now this isn't the kind of sore you feel when you have a cold, this feels like the muscles in my throat are being pulled or something. I think it's even impacting my vocal cords maybe, because when I talk too much I find it gets worse. I can still breathe and don't necessarily feel like I'm being choked, but it is incredibly uncomfortable. The tension typically eases when I'm eating a meal though.\n\nThese symptoms both come and go with no noticable trigger, of course I am playing worst case scenario here and plan to ask the doctor about it, but I figured I'd ask here anyway to see if anyone can relate?",

My vision went blurry for a split second followed by a pain in my head as expected. \n\nThe stingy pain subsided maybe 5 minutes later after A LOT of tears were shed and my boyfriend trying not laugh while consoling me (it was kind of funny). The exact same thing happened exactly a year ago except I banged the back of my head and went to the overnight doctor and the conclusion was that I had a concussion. \n\nBack to present, I\u2019ve woken up this morning with a terrible headache that feels like it\u2019s around my head and mainly my forehead, feeling groggy, tired and very anxious. I took paracetamol but it\u2019s not working. I do suffer with severe anxiety and ocd traits. The last time this happened my mental health was fine but now I\u2019ve been suffering with my MH for the last few months. \n\nSo of course my anxiety and ocd are all on board right now that I have a severe concussion and a bleed on the brain, I\u2019m trying to convince myself that people every day probably had a lot worse bangs to the head and that I\u2019m fine and don\u2019t need to go hospital but I can\u2019t shake the fear. \n\nJust to add: I feel like I\u2019ve been suffering with sinus for the last week, blocked nose, headache constantly, blocked ears but haven\u2019t felt the symptoms in 2 days so maybe that\u2019s also it ? \n\nCan I have anyone else\u2019s thoughts on this as my head feels like it\u2019s in a fog and I can\u2019t think straight. Should I go to hospital ? Is it a concussion ? Or is it just my anxiety ? ",

However, i moved away from my hometown for grad school and tend to ignore all the opportunities I\u2019m getting at grad school and focus on what I\u2019m missing out back home, where I will live when I\u2019m done with grad school in a year and a half, what will happen to my relationship (which\u2019s currently long distance), if I choose to marry this guy (who I\u2019ve only been dating for six months lol) will my parents disown me (I\u2019m Muslim, he\u2019s not), just so many other things that haven\u2019t happened yet and might not happen\u2026I almost ended my relationship yesterday bc I needed him to have all the answers for me and when he didn\u2019t, we both panicked. I was thankfully able to reverse it but I really need to just live in the present even a little, enjoy the things I have, and not catastrophic the future. Instead of being happy with the things I\u2019ve accomplished by 26, all I can I think about is how I\u2019m too old to be dating someone where there\u2019s so many external obstacles against us, because that means I\u2019m going to run out of time to have kids..at 26.

        "body": "My anxiety seems to be more related to social situations but I feel I have bits of GAD too. I get anxiety attack (high HR, shaking, sweating profusely) starting when I talk to people I haven\u2019t talked to in a while, and friends. This also happens in phone calls with friends or where emotions are involved (work for me).   I\u2019m fine with interactions with people I have nothing to do with eg Cashier, phone calls to call agents. \n\n I have been avoiding them trying to heal naturally for a year. And I\u2019m not seeing a big progress and some things are getting worse. \nI\u2019m scared of the side effects (mostly digestive issues) and relying on it forever. Also, knowing that they don\u2019t really do a lot in terms of improvement sometimes and sometimes require alot of trial and error. \n\nI take propranolol rarely for therapy and some situations where i anticipate nervousness. And it makes me feel good but i sweat like a pig on it too\ud83d\ude2d which makes me conscious and feel unwell because im soaked. \n\nIf you guys have something similar, what medication have you been taking? Do they work well? What has helped you? \n",

        "body": "I\u2019m on the hunt for something better for my anxiety. I have GAD that causes nausea and vomiting if I\u2019m not on something plus worry about things that aren\u2019t a big deal, or positive things. And lately, health anxiety after a health scare a few months ago. Currently on buspirone but hate how it\u2019s 2x/day and I don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s covering my anxiety. It\u2019s also been causing gas/gas pain/constipation and perhaps blurred vision slightly. I was on Wellbutrin for over 2 years and that worked amazingly for my anxiety and less sexual side effects than I had with Prozac/lexapro (that was the reason I came off those 2) BUT I had too much weight loss with Wellbutrin. I dropped from 300mg to 150mg and that helped some but my weight just kept dropping. With buspirone, I wake up anxious and then get anxious again in the evening. It has a half life of like 11 hrs so that\u2019s not great. I started on 5mg>7.5>10>12.5>15 (came off Wellbutrin completely once I hit 15mg of buspirone)>20 and now on 25mg because the 20 still wasn\u2019t relieving my anxiety completely. I\u2019m debating going back on Prozac even with the sexual side effects. But have been reading about Cymbalta (duloxetine) as well. I really don\u2019t want something that makes me drowsy, that\u2019s why I loved Wellbutrin because it actually gave me some energy. Maybe since Cymbalta blocks norepinephrine uptake it\u2019ll give me a little energy like Wellbutrin did. \n\nSo I\u2019m basically deciding between Prozac or Cymbalta. Thoughts? I have Clonazepam and Zofran on hand for when anxiety and/or nausea occur and it sounds like Cymbalta causes a fair amount of nausea initially. ",

My problem is I still want to go but now I have absolutely no one to go with or feel comfortable going with and it\u2019s 3 hours away from me. That\u2019s 6 hours in total just driving there and back. I have pretty bad driving anxiety as is and even worse generalized anxiety and ptsd.

I plan on getting on medication for my anxiety soon but I\u2019m wondering what else I can do to overcome this.

So much so that I didn't get a cat for over 10 years. \n\nBut eventually a little shy and starving feral showed up in my yard and I took that as a sign.

I have been told I have severe anxiety with all of this but yet I have been told it was my GI problems. Now they say it is a mixture of both. I have had a stress test , numerous cardiac work ups at the ER, and even a cardiac ct on my heart. All came back good and that I had a calcium score of 0. I\u2019ve also wore a holter monitor and there was nothing but some PVCs which they said was normal because it was less than 1% . But yet I still get these pains. I have came to it that I do have anxiety problem even though I\u2019m on a medication for it now I still get all these pains. My question that I have is can anxiety just get that bad? And cause all these pains? I take a low dose of Xanax for now but when I\u2019m calm my GI problems fire up and start causing the pains then I really do freak out and it seems to get bad for a few days. And my left side pains get so bad . I\u2019m new to this I\u2019ve never been a worrier or anything I\u2019ve lived that wide open contractor life of just going and doing as I please with 0 worries. So what happened and with the mixture of the both can it really get that bad? And what do I need to do about the anxiety? They said the GI problems will cause the pains but with my new medication that will go away slowly but not with the anxiety. And I\u2019m just lost I don\u2019t even feel like my old self anymore. I get no joy to go golf hunt fish or anything",

Sometimes it\u2019s at the back, sometimes sides behind my ears, sometimes the top of head and sometimes it goes to my forehead and I can feel the pressure even in my nose. It\u2019s pretty strong. There is a lot of nerve pain too such as tingling or burning on my scalp. It gets worse when I sit or stand, like my head gets fuzzy, vibrating, sometimes it feels like my brain drops or like someone is tugging at it from behind or like it\u2019s being pumped with air. The longer I am up, the more out of it I feel and I get derealization and brain fog. When I am up for too long the burning and buzzing goes to my neck, shoulders and upper back too, I might feel hot. It all calms down a lot when I lie down. No sinus issues. My neck feels weird too, waiting for a chiropractor appointment to see if it helps. Waiting for a neurologist appointment too and scared it\u2019s a tumor because it\u2019s so weird. I have never been a headache person.  ",

I ended up in the ER because the pressure and anxiety combined triggered a horrible migraine that made me think I was dying. I had a CT scan and I was cleared. Doctor pointed out how tight my neck and trap muscles were. It turned out it went from the base of my neck to the my shoulder blades. The doctor also told me that because of how tight my muscles were, it was pulling at my scalp making it sore. Not saying this is what you have, but once my doctor explained why I\u2019m feeling this way, it made me feel better. \n\nI hope you feel better soon! It\u2019ll take some time, but what helped me was reassuring myself that there is nothing wrong with my head. After I was cleared of course. My health anxiety is awful, but I had to get checked out because I couldn\u2019t sleep from the pain. Honestly, there is nothing wrong with getting checked out just in case. I hope it all turns out fine!",

Sometimes certain body parts will even look funny to me and then I go on this spiral of I\u2019m losing my mind and then I\u2019m very jumpy, almost paranoid the tv is going to start talking to me. I feel like I don\u2019t belong to myself. \nI\u2019ve noticed feeling like this recently and it adds up to the days I\u2019d have really bad panic attacks/: \n\nI\u2019ve been doing a lot for my anxiety recently, ever since my panic attacks minus anymore medication. I won\u2019t be doing anymore medication and that can\u2019t give me much anyways because of my lithium so\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I\u2019ve been doing this yoga challenge for 30 days on YouTube (yoga with Adrian) that\u2019s actually helped a lot with grounding, I guess I really didn\u2019t know how until I started practicing that (day 13 now) I\u2019ve also added Pilates to my strength training, I\u2019ve practiced DARE to death practically. \n\nI recently had a panic attack and it was so much shorter and easier to deal with ever since practicing more mindfulness and even challenging  it. It\u2019s still very scary tho, waking up and immediately feeling like I\u2019m losing my mind is super \n\n",

So it started again last December after I heard about someone itching and read a comment on here from when I had posted last time. And that kicked it all off. \n\nI suppose that's the proof that it is a mental issue.\n\nI also read that when we are under stress the body releases histamine, especially when its prolonged (anxiety, worry over the hair feeling)...hence the hives. \n\nLiterally the same symptoms as last time I had it and all tests where clear back then and Nothings changed, only my stress and worry."

Chronic dizziness could be a symptom of other medical issues, so I think it\u2019d be very wise to talk with your doctor.\n\nI have a chronic medical condition that causes dizziness, so I can definitely relate to how you feel! I can give you a little advice on what works for me (though it may not work for you.) \n\nFor me, I need to stay hydrated. Not drinking water makes my dizziness SOOO much worse. Also, I need to eat a little more salt than the normal person. I have low blood pressure, so it\u2019s okay for me to increase my sodium intake. Definitely don\u2019t do that if you struggle with high blood pressure! Additionally, living an active lifestyle is probably the best thing for my dizziness.

But if I\u2019m active and moving about all day, dizziness is never as much of an issue.

For context, I have three main anxiety disorders. Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder EPA, and Severe Health Anxiety HA. I went to the hospital earlier this month around 2 weeks ago over a spontaneous migraine headache that lasted 5 days because I'm afraid of pills and convinced myself it was a brain tumor. \n\nIt seems like I can never catch a break when it comes to feeling pain, whether *real or fake* so here I go again with a pain I know is real but being raised up in my mind as something awful and wondering if anyone has gone through the same pain who'd be willing to lend some advice. \n\nIt's lasted three days off and on, no pain meds *of course* because again I am scared of pills, even Tylenol. It is in my mid to lower back and feels like a dull pain that happens only when I stand too long and usually goes away after sitting down or laying down. (Of course it hasn't yet, as I lay here typing, probably because I'm literally writing about it.)\n\nMy rational *and less dominant side* says its just from bad posture or I pulled a muscle while trying to pop my back a couple days ago. However, Mr Anxiety believes it is in fact a spinal hemorrhage of some sort or \\**get this\\** kidney failure. \n\nI know us anxiety folks deal with this crap *a lot* but just wondering if anyone else goes through the same and can rationalize with my non dominant part of theory that I am alright. You'd basically be my knight in shining armor without having to spend a huge bill over hearing the same thing from the ER staff that I am sure are sick of me already. \n\nAlso, fun little add on, went to the doctor today as a follow up over my migraine headache ER trip and ended up turning into her concerned over my weight loss of 13 pounds in three months due to anxiety making me afraid to eat sometimes. Says its an eating disorder, I don't know I just figure its just a rare occurrence that I am currently doing better on and wants a weight update in **2 WEEKS** along with scary blood drawl on the 15th. Hurray! SCREW ANXIETY!!! \n\n&#x200B;\n\nP.S... I HATE NEEDLES!",

                "body": "It is far more likely to be muscle tension than anything else. Anxiety causes muscle tension. I had something similar myself a few years ago, where my lower back was in knots all the time and I was convinced my organs were dying. I would pace around trying to calm myself down (for me the ER is more anxiety inducing so I don't see it as a place of reassurance). All of the pain went away by itself when my life situation changed (finished grad school, mostly). I would not have thought that \"just\" muscle tension could cause that big of an effect on my body, but that's what it was.\n\n\nAre you actively doing anything to try to relieve the pain? If you don't want to take pills, that's fine--what about applying heat to your back, or gently rolling over a tennis ball in the area where it hurts? Movement seems like it's what you shouldn't do, but actually it helps much more with back pain than lying still and trying to protect the muscles. They need a chance to unknot themselves. Go slow and listen to how your body feels. Trust your body. You're ok.",

I noticed my back feels better when I take my hand and rub over the area that hurts which did give me some reassurance but as you know anxiety is a monster. I'll try your tennis ball trick for sure! I would try heat but I don't actively own a heating pad or anything of the sort at the moment. \n\nAlso, I can totally understand the hospital bringing more anxiety. The ER helps me, but only one specific place in the city I live in since they know all my *mental issues.* Otherwise, I get horrible anxiety everywhere else, Even my primary care doctor stresses me out. \n\nSeriously, thank you for your time. It means a lot."

        "author": "UnableLettuce344",
        "timestamp": "2024-02-28 14:00:55",
        "body": "Hi please help me out -- I'm 22f. I am honestly terrified because my sleep generally has not been amazing (I track it every night, sometimes I wake up, other times I get around maybe 5-6 hours on average). But sleeping for 8 hours straight is basically unheard of for me. I'm so scared that this affects my productivity and prematurely ages me, but the fear makes my heart rate even higher in bed and I just CANT. SLEEP. AND IDK WHAT TO DO.  Like I am WAY too young for this and scared it will only get worse in grad school, with kids/marriage in the future, etc.  \nI'm especially frustrated because I am currently sick with a fever; the night before last, I fell asleep at 11pm- woke up at midnight WIDE (I mean like VERY WIDE) awake. Then I stayed up till like 7AM. Admittedly, some of that was on screens, but I have a history of panic attacks and anxiety and it seems intolerable to close my eyes and feel existential dread knowing there is no distraction and sometimes I will just lie down that way (even with a blindfold, listening to a podcast). Then I slept from maybe 7-noon.  \nLAST NIGHT, i had (have) a fever. I (1) did an ice dunk to help anxiety, (2) wore a red light mask and meditated 20 mins in bed, (3) drank herbal tea (4) put on a podcast (note: podcasts historically are about the only way I can sleep). But I lay awake for 30 mins and then gave up and proceeded to watch funny youtube videos to calm myself (heart rate was really high). I slept from like 4-7:50 AM and woke up WIRED (like, jolted, IDK how to explain). Like I am shaky almost and the fact of getting so little sleep made me more anxious and mad (because sleep is a HUGE GOAL OF MINE and I took steps yesterday to achieve it, and I NEED it now because I have a fever, and it is JUST NOT COMING TO ME).   \nI am so frustrated and desperate and feel at my wits ends, and I'm scared I will have some health crisis  (either immediately or in the future) from lack of sleep and age prematurely and get ugly and old quickly and even now I'm on the verge of tears but I can't bring myself to cry lol. Like I am so envious of people who can sleep 8+ hours and I feel they will be more attractive than me and it's an uphill climb and makes me want to scream because even when I feel like I do things that SHOULD BE conducive to sleep, my body simply will not. But I understand that stress about the stress is not helpful.  \nMore information about me: I am 22F, I do exercise at the gym (but I want to more, currently it's at 3-4x a week, and in fairness yesterday I didn't exercise, but I was sick). I do drink 2 coffees a day and a tea but I to limit these to at least before 5pm. I do have history of trauma and anxiety, which may account for some of this -- my BF has pointed out that the joltedness seems consistent with being stuck in fight or flight / adrenal fatigue. I do not smoke, drink, or do any drugs.  \nThe task seems insurmountable and I really really need someone to tell me this is fixable. I feel so alone and scared. Idk I really can't express my degree of desperation. Especially now, because my body is sick, and NEEDS rest more than ever, and simply is not cooperating.. It is so scary to feel like I'm doing the \"right things\" (meditating, blindfold, fan) and still not sleeping. In fairness, meditating I don't do every day, and I do use screens before bed, but the alternative to me seems to be lying awake for 8+ hours with existential dread and a crazy heart rate while the world is asleep and no one can help me.   \nThings I tell myself to self-soothe:  \n(1) it is fixable! You have slept before well and you will again.   \n(2) feeling like you're doing everything to sleep, but still using screens at night, means you haven't exhausted all options -- and that's a good thing! You just need to find ways to self-soothe and/or sit with the anxiety at night without youtube or social media distracting you.  \n(3) it will be a cumulative effect/learned skill -- once you sleep well once, you will not stress that \"oh this is permanent,\" which may reduce nighttime anxiety the next night and so on...  \n(4) you often sleep LATE (college grind..) like 4am-10:30am so maybe when you try to sleep at 11PM the body is just confused. Have mercy on yourself and be patient.  \n(5) sleeplessness is amplifying the feelings of fear and anxiety. Those will also decrease when you rest.  \nAny other thoughts??? Again I can't tell you how scared I am lol like I am considering going to the hosptial to ask if they can help induce me to sleep I don't even know",

                "body": "1. You don't need to sleep 8 hours a day. It's a general recommendation. Sometimes 5 to 6 hours is just what your body decided to do tgat day and questioning it is not helpful\n\n\n2. If you have read anything online or heard anything about how important 8 hours is and that lacking those 8 hours could cause all these terrible things to happen to you. A lot of that is just fear mongering, some of it are people asking for legislative changes so that people can have better work life balance in all sectors, and some if it is just doctors saying: sleep is good actually, have you tried it?\n\n\nThere is soooo so much stuff about sleep that scientists don't know about. We just know it's necessary and helpful and in general 7 to 9 hours is good for us.\u00a0\n\n\nIt is a nasty cycle though, not sleeping enough.\u00a0\n\n\nThe only way to go to sleep is to not think about sleeping. Distract yourself from sleeping. Don't make the goal to sleep.\n\n\nI'm not a scientist, I just like reading research papers about sleep. Some papers say don't use a phone 2 hours before, some say don't use it 20 minutes before, some say it doesn't make that big of a difference.\n\n\nI still use my phone before sleeping and I sleep about 9 hours. I don't know how good the sleep is but I have learned that, scientists don't really know either.\n\n\nAlso I often feel wired and super hyper and awake after only 2 hours of sleep. Dunno why, but it's not something to worry about.\n\n\n\n\nUhh also if you usually sleep at 4 am then it's super hard to sleep at 11 pm. Not because your brain is confused but because you already made the habit. New circadian rhythm. You can try sleeping at 11:30 but if it's hard, yeah, that's completely normal.\u00a0\n\n\n(sorry, thid is getting long, I wanna answer your bulleted points real quick)\n\n\n1. It's fixable, but you're not killing yourself by sleeping the way you do. It's just inconvenient\n2. Don't focus on self soothing in order to sleep. Self soothe to stop the anxiety. Don't beat yourself up for using your phone.\n3. You need to sleep at 11:30 pm consistently and wake up consistently the same time everyday (including weekends) until you will do it automatically. It's unrealistic to jump from 4 am to 11:30 pm\n4. Yes, you're right.\n5. Also correct. Take it easy\n\n\nSorry I'm just a nerd about sleep info so I just wanted to do some mini myth busting. Again, not a scientist, just like reading peer reviewed science articles for funzies.",

        "body": "This all started last year, after I came home from the er I was sick and couldn\u2019t eat a lot and googled when I shouldn\u2019t have, ever since then I\u2019ve had pain I\u2019ve never felt before and it\u2019s scaring me, I think I\u2019m slowly dying like my right knee hurts, head/neck hurts when I angle it a certain way etc, I\u2019m terrified I\u2019m slowly dying my face is warm sometimes, sometimes my legs will burn like the skin will and then it stops, I feel fine I don\u2019t feel anxious but then I feel a pain and remember a story I read online about a disease and then panic, I used to ask for reassurance a lot and stopped to heal but it\u2019s just I don\u2019t know what to do, my body either feels unwell or weird and I don\u2019t like it, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s my stomach causing it or what but I\u2019m genuinely thinking of self harm to distract the nasty ill feeling :(( but I don\u2019t want too , I know self harming is a bad thing and should never be done but I just want the pain to stop :( I\u2019m so defeated, I\u2019m creeping up on a year of my body being weird, I just don\u2019t know anymore why do I always assume the worst instead of reasonable causes ? Is it bad I think I deserve this as punishment for being. A bad person? I don\u2019t know my brain is scattered. I\u2019m genuinely terrified I\u2019m living my last days or I\u2019ve already died,, nobody I know irl has actually sat me down and talked with me about anxiety because they don\u2019t really believe in it so it\u2019s just nice to hopefully find people who understand I won\u2019t say what sickness I fear I have in this post to not trigger people but, I\u2019m sorry non the less this post is probably a waste of time  I also feel nauseous and bloated a lot unable to pass gas\u2019s or poop a lot, so idk I\u2019m sorry I\u2019ve also been seeing black dots? And it makes me really scared sometimes and sometimes it doesn\u2019t bother me I also feel sick but not sick? It\u2019s hard to explain and then my eyes burn sometimes too",

Most days feel like I have to perpetually have my guard up in the case of a medical emergency. I will survive each panic attack again and again, tell myself on loop that it\u2019s just anxiety, but still be an anxious mess about a similar theme the following day. I constantly worry about death- it\u2019s been so horribly hard to just enjoy the present moment. I have no idea what to do with myself. Even things that are recommended to help, like taking a walk or doing yoga, feel so scary to do alone. I don\u2019t want to take medication, I\u2019ve been in therapy for a few months but I\u2019m still effectively a shell of a human being, and it makes me so so sad. It\u2019s been a long time since I haven\u2019t felt disturbed. I just want it to end and I don\u2019t want to ever experience something like this again.

Any avoidant behaviors is teaching yourself to avoid and then it makes a small thing into a monster.\n\n\nFor example, I had a panic attack at my favorite restaurant. I avoided it for a few months. Until I decided to face the anxiety, just eat a small snack not a full meal, and do some relaxing things there to calm myself down and also I wore a mask so I could hide my tears (looks like allergies, not anxiety) and I got through it and enjoyed some fries. Now I can go back there. Although I feel a bit of anxiety if I sit in the same spot I had the panic attack.\u00a0\n\n\nWhereas checking my mail I have a habit of avoiding because I once got a scary letter like 5 years ago and ever since then I am scared to check it. So even 5 years later my heart goes crazy and I feel like I am going to die as I open my mail box.\n\n\nSo if you avoid it, it will stay scary and anxiety inducing. If you face it the anxiety will eventually go away. But it depends on how big the monster it became.",

I used my resources and got through it ok with some stress and muscle pain that was lingering on till the next day. Yesterday I left work early because of briefly blacking out, chest pains, and tremors. A family member took me to Urgent Care and the doctor said it was an anxiety attack. My first ever. I knew before I went it could be anxiety caused but I was scared and didn't feel right. Honestly if the Dr. told me I had a minor heart attack I would have believed them. I had never felt that way before. None of this is ideal but fine cool whatever. I can get help and deal with it.\n\nMy question is this: I don't meet with my therapist till Friday. Is this something I should inform her of now? I will be informing her either in my session or in our messages ahead of the appointment.\n\nMy concern with telling her now is her telling me that my case and my anxiety is more than she is capable of handling and cutting care. If that (admittedly worst case scenario) happens then I don't know what to do. These therapy appointments are one of the things I anticipate all week. They keep me going.\n\nEdit: I just messaged them now anyways to avoid the anxiety of putting it off. If this blows-up in my face that's fine. I know I tried my best.",

I have no idea if it\u2019s helpful, but it would be incredibly difficult for people to know what you\u2019re doing on your phone without physically taking your phone and going through it, which would be time consuming and very hard to do without you noticing. Is it impossible? No, but is it LIKELY \u2013 not at all. It\u2019s a good thing that you\u2019re able to acknowledge your anxiety and that you\u2019re asking for help. Unfortunately there\u2019s not much a bunch of random people on the internet can do for you. I\u2019m really sorry to hear you\u2019re feeling so tense right now and I hope you find some calm soon.",

        "body": "This situation is a bit ironic, but I booked a doctor\u2019s appointment a couple of weeks in advance to talk about anxiety/depression symptoms that I\u2019ve been dealing with lately. However, due to certain circumstances I was feeling slightly better and decided to cancel the appointment and was concerned I would be wasting their time and something about going there makes me feel uncomfortable so I try to avoid it where I can.\n\nAnyway, I unexpectedly received a phone call asking me where I was, and I replied immediately saying I had already cancelled it on an app they used. They told me that it hadn\u2019t come through on their system so essentially I was a no-show. I had not replied to an automated message due to thinking the app covered it.. The receptionist then was quite short/blunt and said she would tell the doctor I didn\u2019t need it anymore and more or less hung up pretty abruptly.\n\nNow, ironically I feel more anxious again and can\u2019t properly calm down over my fear of being an annoying patient. I say this as a health professional myself which actually makes me feel more pressure to act calm and collected. Also I have known this doctor for a long time and feel I have displayed some behaviours in the past that would be considered mildly entitled/annoying, but I don\u2019t think I was trying to do so on purpose. I remember I had apologised to this doctor when I was much younger for being rude previously and they told me they didn\u2019t even remember, so I don\u2019t think they are upset at me, I just know in myself I am overthinking it but I regret not going now..\n\nIt\u2019s not possible to book another appointment now for other reasons so I just have to sit with this feeling for now. I already see a therapist for these issues. Just wanting to rant a little!",

I think she was having a hard day or something but she suddenly didn't listen to anything I said and just didn't sound like she cared and I also felt like maybe I was the boring annoying patient who has anxiety about nothing and is just wasting time for a patient with more severe anxiety.\n\n\nSo instead I told myself: it's not fair to just end things or decide things without ever talking to somebody again. I can't read minds and I habe no idea, maybe she had a really exhausting experience with a patient or something else going on that I don't need to know.\u00a0\n\n\nAnd even if they thought you were annoying, maybe this happened one time, show them that you are not annoying. Just go show up again\n\n\nI did this one time and it was just the stupidest thing for me. I scheduled a massage because I was extremely anxious and just needed something that could possibly relax me. But I accidentally scheduled it on my work day, not on the weekend, so I missed it and got an angry email from the massage place. And I was so upset, I rescheduled, bought some fancy cookies to apologize. They didn't charge me for the previous appointment. But I cried the entire time I got the massage and on the way home. So I basically just wasted me time. I guess I gave them cookies but the point was to relax.\n\n\nSo basically, don't feel bad especially about digital stuff or over the phone stuff, or just stuff that isn't face to face. It's so easy to make mistakes everyone makes them and it's easy to empathize.\n\n\nAlthough Mr. Anxiety really does want you to feel bad. Not today Mr. Anxiety. You're not helping.",

I don\u2019t. \n\nBit of a funny \u2026last summer while visiting my homeland i went to a favorite place from my childhood - my family\u2019s village. I\u2019m at the very edge of the village and there\u2019s nothing. but fields and woods and serenity. There\u2019s a Levi there, and i found this spot that\u2019s kinda shaped like a Herman miller chair (lol yes), and i sit down in it in the tall grass, and lay back. Taking in the fresh country air and listening to the birds sing and smelling the green chestnuts on the tree nearby. I had a moment of a few minutes where I completely relaxed. Then this asshole comes along on the road at the top of the Levi and says \u201chey watch out there are ticks in the grass\u201d. SOB!!!  6 minutes of peace and this asshat came and ruined it. Oh well. That was in July. I haven\u2019t felt that again since.",

                "body": "Yeah. I've never been a confident or a very secure person, and had a whole bunch of other problems, but I started having severe panic attacks after COVID and following health scares. It's... Really something. For whatever reason, everything fills me with a sense of dread and panic, but the worst part is the physical reaction - racing heart beat, cramping, insane blood pressure (which is otherwise pretty normal), etc. Things I used to love also got quite tolling. I perfectly remember how easy it was to do things in the past - and how hard it is now, but also aside from anxiety and health responses, I am at the best mental health point in years. It sucks to go through it, but good days make it all worth it, even if they happen rarely. Small things make a difference, too. I found that it helps to eat healthy - avoiding sour, fried and junk foods makes a huge difference for me. And when anxiety hits badly or when I feel physically sick, I just focus on something meaningless and simple to wait it out - like a cardboard puzzle or a simple online game. Usually, I get better in an hour or so as the panic slowly fades to manageable level.\n\n\nSorry for the over sharing, what I really wanted to say is that you aren't alone, and I hope it gets better for you. Anxiety is one hell of a ride, but there are things in life that make it all worth it. I think the past years were extremely hard for everyone, and it's sadly expectable that many more people had the flare up of anxiety and panic attacks.\u00a0",

                "body": "Hi friend. Having difficult conversations with people you love is one of the hardest things in life from my experience. The way I approach it is:\n\n1. Picking a time first for yourself that you\u2019re going to have the conversation.\n\n2. Inform your partner beforehand that you\u2019d like to speak to them at the time. This can be the day of. A simple, \u201ccan we put aside some time to talk?\u201d \n\n3. Rehearse your main points with yourself\n\n4. Be ready to listen. \n\n5. Don\u2019t compromise your boundaries when having the conversation. \n\n6. Observe the way your partner handles the problems you bring up with the relationship. Are they dismissive? Receptive? Do they understand where you\u2019re coming from? \n\n7. If you are nervous about it beforehand as I often am, distract your brain by focusing on what you can control. I like to tell myself, \u201conce the conversation is over I\u2019m going to make dinner/watch my favorite show/read a book. It helps me ground myself and contextualize the scary conversation as just a normal part of the day. \n\n8. Be honest with yourself about whether the conversation yielded what you needed afterwards. If they participated, listened, were willing to make changes and actively work on your relationship, then there is something to hold onto. If it disintegrates into argument, stonewalling, or gaslighting, then it is time to walk away",

I had had what I thought was panic attacks in the past, but now I think they were more aniexty attacks I could tell I was panicking and making it worse at those moments so I didn\u2019t think much of it. It has been a while since anything like that happened. \n\nToday I had a rough day. Gave plasma, got home just so irritated. Hugrey and pissy. But I cooled off. So later the same day I go to smoke weed with my sister. I am an experienced smoker, used to have my medcard(now expired) , and smoke twice a day, and usually I am fine or even less anxious after smoking. So we finish smoking maybe 10 minutes after I just feel lightheaded. I\u2019ve always been a faint girl, so that wasn\u2019t a big thing. But I felt lightheaded, I started not being able to really hear, just ringing, I felt like I was about to pass out. \n\nSo I go to sit in my room and my sister follows me to try to help. I\u2019m just sitting there I could do really anything. It was very scarey. It was so vivid so harsh so severe, I\u2019d never felt this faint before in my life. I couldn\u2019t hear a thing my whole body was sweating. I just felt numb. My eyes were closed and I was leaning my head against my sister and all I could see was white. \n\nIn my head for a moment I did think I was going to die cause I\u2019m over hear thinking I\u2019m seeing the light like this is gonna be my last day. I was just breathing just trying to breath cause that\u2019s all I could really do. Eventually it passed over me like a wave but I still felt very bad I felt like I was going to shit myself so then I\u2019m like running to the bathroom and I just sat in there for a while. \n\nAfter I ate some food and felt better. Later the same day, like right before bed, we are smoking again, and I feel this coming on AGAIN. Not nearly as strong just barely anything compared to it. So why am I typing all this? I want to know if any of you guys have experience like this? Was this a silent panic attack? Was I just faint cause of the plasma? Or maybe a combo of both. Any advice comments just info appreciated",

        "body": "Hi fellow sufferers, do you have any of these???\n\nHere are some of my experiences that im going through, suffering from anxiety disorder trigggered by severe burnout. Do you recognize any of them, some of them or most of them? Are we in the same boat? \ud83e\udef6\n\n\n1. Trying to deal with constant dissapointments is exhausting: you might be ok in the evening but you wake up feeling horrible again, or you feel ok in the morning but suddenly in the afternoon the anxiety hits hard. And on and on. \n\n2. Your thoughts are mainly focused on yourself, on your mental and physical sensations, cant really take any interest in others anymore. You stare but your lizard brain is doing its own thing ruminating.\n\n3. Sometimes you feel so bad anxiety that you dont know if you going insane, need to hit something, or hit yourself. \n\n4. Sometimes the anxiety feels like a black heavy ball in the upper stomach just growing and growing, and you dont know if you should puke, cry or scream to get it out. For me ive noticed that crying helps.\n\n5. Feels like you are in a never ending nightmare rollercoaster, from good to bad moments. And nobody can say when this rollercoaster ends so you just have to sit and wait. And try to trust that this too shall pass.\n\n6. Being afraid of \u201dwhat if someday I just cant deal with it anymore\u201d\n\n7. Hiding sharp knives cause they scare you because you weirdly think that \u201dwhat if i get so bad i hurt myself\u201d\n\n8. Although people / therapist say you getting better slowly but slowly is too slow for you and you dont think you getting better at all except on good day you might feel different. On good days you feel some trust in getting better, a ray of hopefulness and then the bad moment hits and you feel defeated and hopeless again.\n\n9. Constant fight between hope and hopelessness\n\n10. Cant really take a good nap anymore cause afraid you wake up with worse anxiety\n\n11. Trying to avoid news cause the only things you hear / pick up are headlines about scary mental health things (\u201dxx commited suicide\u201d\u201ddepression so bad nothing helped\u201d etc). Getting huge anxiety surge everytime. Thats your brain trying to find \u201ddanger\u201d\n\n12. Often thinking how you feel must be worse than anybody elses anxiety makes them feel and that there must be some other bad/worse mental health issue you actually have that nobody has yet picked up on (even if your do tor/therapist say it is anxiety/gad, many many times). You just cant believe that anxiety can make you feel so awful, scared, doomed etc. Sometimes you feel you must be \u201dpoisoned\u201d\n\n13. Seeking reassurance online, reading other peoples experiences, trying to find \u201dsuccess stories\u201d how somebody who felt like you now has become better. \n\n14. Being fixated in reading about possible meds for anxiety, and of course the stories about side effects that then scare you so much you cant start any. Then you feel trapped, cause you dont feel good but you too scared to try a possible cure.\n\n15. spending too much time online, picking up only the sad or scary or negative things about mental healt or medications, stress levels go higher, followed by bad sleep and next morning worse anxiety.\n\n16. Feels like no matter how many time you read the stuffs about anxiety disorder, and how much you know about it, gone through it, the lizard brain just goes on and on to find more/read more and in the end the most you remember is are the bad stuffs youve read (Ive even blocked some pages, blocked search engines but nothing helps cause i just override them \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05 \n\nI really wish the best to all of you who go through anxiety or have gone through it, Thanks for discussing \ud83c\udf39 \n",

I want to say that i was kind of innocent and gullible in childhood but still got along with classmates and kids of my age thts what i used to think but it wasn't like that thing is my classmates were mostly Gujarati and i was hindi speaking but was born and bought up in gujarat so i can read write and speak gujarati fluently thanks to gujarati subject in school my school was coed but girls were kinda boring back then and were unnecessarily loud and annoying, boys were froming groups based on acedemics and sport and i was average in both so i had no common ground to make friends to socialize\nBut luckily still managed to make few friends but they left around 6-7 std and some in 10th basically as i am introspecting now i realized i never put effort not even approached them might be sharing lunch was enough to initiate the conversation but neither they are significant to me nor i am for them \n\nSame goes with college friends but I've struck upon thought that i am never investing enough in any relationship be it with my parents or sister like my efforts are negligible compared to them tho as a man i have sense of responsibility towards them and can't live without them coz they love me so much\n\nThis guilt has made me take care of them and support them which has improved our relationship but i still sometimes think that need some personal space where im not being a son or brother but myself which im unable to communicate with them sometimes I can't articulate my thoughts in words \n\nalso many times i feel like im loosing friends because ive never done any favours never went out of way to help them \n\nHeck even never approched them for first time except for making group project like first time when i approached a guy in college to get involved in their project group as they were makin best presentation in class rest of my friends have initiated conversation with me made me their friends earned my trust and maintaining friendship they even take stand for me when i need and are very caring snd understanding \n\nBut like in past id snitched in a situation and lied here and there to like avoid doing any favours (don't know right word for it ) like i scare to get close enough or overshare with any friends and kind of unable to trust anyone \n\nWill i be ever come out my shell to live fully coz i feel lonely here none to talk and ive nothing to talk either aside from small talks to any of my friends like i said earlier i am not a good person either and don't have a communication skills and can't socialize easily \n\nPlease someone help me with this situation as it's affecting my career too I can't say no easily thus i lie can't do well in that either and get caught have no negotiation skills mostly get scammed by sellers\n\nI know it's common problem and can be worked upon but feeling stuck is giving me anxiety about will i be able to get over it it's almost suffocating ",

However, after almost 2 years of taking it, I feel like it doesn't work well for me. It mainly makes me feel sleepy and foggy all the time.\n\nI'm curious if others have had a similar experience. If so, what medication are you currently taking, and has it helped in managing your anxiety?",

My general doctor treated it like it was inflammation, but in reality to treat the body symptoms you have to treat the mind.\n\nIf you can, seek someone knowledgable in mental health like a psychiatrist or a therapist. Tackle what\u2019s been going through your head. It sucks but treat it like your homeopathic system is trying to twist the knobs to get your body back to base level, but your anxiety will keep messing everything up like a clumsy puppy.

        "body": "I am a latino and how I grew up is is basically the idea that there isn\u2019t such a thing as a mental health problem and you need to just suck it up. I never really was taught how to handle my anxiety except to just liven up and never talk about it. Anytime I get anxious my throat drys up and I get really tongue tied, and I feel a rush of blood and throbbing in my head. I mostly get this when I have to do stuff in front of people and the most of the attention is on me. I try my best to avoid situations where the attention is on me for this reason. I hate presentations and public speaking. I feel like I am going to make a fool out of myself. I recently got hired onto a job where I have to perform certain tasks in front of a group of people and I had to perform certain tasks in front of them today and I was starting to feel really anxious and felt super tongue tied and dry throat and I was shaking and shivering and messing up the task and acting weird. I feel like I embarrassed myself. When I got hired everybody seemed so lively, funny and nice and buddy buddy and I wanted to fit in. I don\u2019t want to bring a negative mood and my anxiety into there and I feel ashamed and embarrassed, even though I know I shouldn\u2019t but I can\u2019t help but feel ashamed of being anxious when rationally this isn\u2019t something to get anxious over. I just needed to say this I hope someone can relate to something that I said.",

The best way to describe it is that it feels like the blood vessels in my head and neck are going to pop. It is not inherently painful and I\u2019m not experiencing any headaches or migraines with it. I also get dizzy when the pressure comes. Currently, it is constant and certain positions can aggravate it like laying on my stomach, bending down, etc. I also feel pressure/clogged feeling in my ears. \n\nI was in the ER a month ago and got a head CT scan and EKG and everything seems fine besides my blood pressure being a bit high which the doctor brushed off as anxiety. I was \u201cdiagnosed\u201d with vertigo that day but the motion sickness medications they prescribed did nothing for me. I have to wait till April to see a primary care doctor about all these symptoms since my insurance changed at the start of the year. \n\nShould I be worried about these sensations? I don\u2019t know if I can hold off till April without having to go to the ER again for peace of mind (it\u2019s just way too expensive). I have health anxiety so I made the mistake of googling my symptoms and I\u2019m convinced I have POTS or a CSF leak or something. I\u2019m also worried it might be vascular and that my neck arteries are holding on for dear life. Can anyone relate? \n",

So I took another. One hour later, no difference.\n\nI am going insane and am in agony. Not a day goes by without this happening. If it wasn\u2019t obvious, I\u2019m disabled, can\u2019t leave home, can\u2019t take care of myself, and can no longer leave my bed. These horrific episodes of anxiety and panic all day every day seemingly happen for no reason. I have lost everything because of it.",

                "body": "I feel like Ativan only helps for panic attacks. To be honest it didn\u2019t help me, it made feel tired but I still had the crippling anxiety feeling so it didn\u2019t really help at all. I had to take a daily anti anxiety. I took  lexpro for that feeling to fully go away.  If you need something for constant feeling I wouldn\u2019t recommend benzo personally.  I feel for you I know it probably doesn\u2019t feel like anyone understands what you\u2019re going through. And the people that never had anxiety dam must feel nice. Lol you should def talk to your doctor about ssri unless you already on one. I hope you can find some ease. I felt like I was going insane like I was going to loose control and it scared the shit out of me and out me in a spiral. I would have breakdowns every day after work and just cry and funny because sleeping was the only escape for where as I find for others was a struggle. I would talk to your doctor if you can about maybe trying something new, it sucks because with anxiety there is so many medications it\u2019s kinda like shopping gotta find the right one. \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f",

I felt lightheaded in the car & out of sorts. My vision then started to get black (tunnel vision). So I went to the ER, while in the waiting room I started to have difficulty breathing & I told the nurse & he took my blood pressure & he thinks I was hyperventilating.\n\nThe doctor ultimately told me I have low phosphorous levels & prescribed oral tablets to take for a day, which I did. CT Scan, bloodwork, EKG, X-Ray came back normal otherwise.\n\nFor the last 2 days I feel like I am on the edge of a panic attack & I have to constantly work to suppress my thoughts. Even though the tests are normal, I still feel like something's somewhat wrong with me. But when I think that, I start to panic again.\n\nWhen this happens, I feel difficulty breathing like my lungs are deflated. I feel slight tightness in my chest & sometimes brief sharp pains in my chest, wooziness & lightheadedness.\n\nI don't have a doctor & the only ones available in my health insurance are booked out for a couple of months in my area. I was able to get one on Mar 11 but it's kind of far away.\n\nI feel like this won't end & I have to constantly work to suppress it. When I start to think about my chest having some sort of issue, it happens again.\n\nI feel like these are anxiety attacks. I have anxiety sometimes especially social anxiety, but I've never had attacks like these before. Even though I tell myself this is just anxiety & I'm 99% sure there's nothing wrong with me, it still doesn't go away. Is it supposed to last this long?\n\nJust want to tell the story of my last handful of days. Just looking for any advice.",

I\u2019ve had my share of ER trips because of them.\n\nI\u2019ve recently been reading about something called \u201crolling panic attacks.\u201d Prior to finding out about these types of attacks I had only heard about the kind that usually last about half an hour to an hour. I kept thinking \u201cthere\u2019s no way all these symptoms could be anxiety/ panic attacks because they are lasting too long.\u201d\n\nCurrently fighting off an attack right now. I\u2019ve been on the verge for days. But I\u2019m just trying to take it easy, distract myself, reading posts about other people who have \u201crolling\u201d or \u201cwaves\u201d of attacks. \n\nI hope you feel better soon.",

If I could borrow an analogy from Jaida Essence Hall. This is a metaphor but it's also a universal truth. Inside everyone is a star, a beautiful star that can do the things and be the things you want. That's in yourself. It's sometimes hard (very hard) to see it, but it's in there. Put in the effort to find it so that other people can appreciate the beauty of what's inside you rather than covering it up.\n\n\nIt's okay to feel wibbly wobbly when you get on the bus (I don't think most people enjoy the school bus either).\n\n\nIt's okay to avoid eye contact. And it's sooo super okay to have a lazy eye. I think if people notice that it's noticinh a vulnerable part of you so they might make fun of it bit I think that's a part that also is related to the uniqueness if your inner star. That you might have a different eye shape that makes you feel vulnerable. You can use that vulnerability to understand other people's differences and vulnerability. It's not a bad thing and it definitely doesn't make you ugly.\n\n\nAlso being ugly is a lie. Nobody is actually ugly, they're just not fitting some standard. You can find a way to fit the standard with color theory, or understanding composition and balance. But being pretty is overrated. I've got pretty privilege and I don't really get how it's a privilege because people take my appearance as an invitation to harrass me. So like either you're bullied for being \"ugly\" or harrassed for being \"pretty\" doesn't matter. All conditions suck. Don't blame yourself for how others treat you.\n\n\nIt's hard right now, but it'll definitely get better. Look for your good points. They are absolutely there you just can't see them because of anxiety or a habit of self loathing.",

It was extremely intense at first, coming and going, and I figured out that alcohol and caffeine were triggers, so I cut them out. Over the past several months, things have improved a bit, but the symptoms are still hanging around. Now, it's more of a persistent lightheaded, imbalanced feeling. I've got this strange ringing in both ears, like the sound of an engine. Went to the emergency room a couple of times, did all the tests, but nothing conclusive. Interestingly, my blood pressure drops to 90/30 and my pulse can go as low as 32, though I\u2019m not sure if it's not directly linked to the episodes. Trying to connect it to my activities or diet, but no luck. I saw an ENT, and they said M\u00e9ni\u00e8re\u2019s disease and central labyrinthitis are unlikely, recommending that I see a cardiologist. Scheduled for that soon.\n\nOn top of all this, throughout this ordeal, I've experienced really heightened anxiety and have had terrifying panic attacks.

Anxiety in addition to physical symptoms is no fun, and it\u2019s even worse when you can\u2019t tell which came first/what caused what.\n\nFrom what you\u2019ve said though, it sounds to me more like the physical symptoms are triggering anxiety/panic (and with such pervasive symptoms, who can blame you! It sounds like your body is on high alert 24/7, and that can take a toll on the mind). I think it would be worth bringing up the anxiety to your care team though for sure. Anxiety can indeed have some wild effects. When I have a panic attack, it\u2019s like any sort of biology logic goes out the window and my body feels off in so many ways. And it may end up that the anxiety is separate from the physical symptoms, and your doctor can for sure help with that. \n\nI hear you in that your fearful it won\u2019t get better. I can tell you for sure that it will get better. It sounds like you\u2019re taking a lot of great steps in getting this figured out, and towards recovery.

I was about to go into a meeting I was running (just me and another colleague), and I had to say \u201chey just so you know, I\u2019m on the brink of a panic attack so if I act weird, that\u2019s why\u201d. He was very understanding and told me to go take the week off, but I said I\u2019m fine and continued on with the meeting. My heart was in my ears and I thought I was gonna faint , but as I continued running the meeting the feeling slowly went away. I ended up leaving work early just because I felt very highly strung, but the fact that I worked myself down from a panic attack is pretty awesome (I think anyway).",

        "body": "Background: I work in a physiotherapy clinic as a front desk person. I'm the only person who works there at the front desk. Our clinic doesn't have that many patients. I joined the clinic 5 months ago and it is my first job aside from working fast chain.\n\nThe patient, who left the clinic, has been a patient at our clinic for a year now. When I first started I had to cancel his appointment because the therapist was sick, he was really upset and kinda mad. I did call him an hour or so before. He kept on saying he wanted his massage today no matter what and that he would be coming there soon. He said he wanted to talk with the owner and blah and blah. Somehow he calmed down and didn't come. The next time, he met me, he did apologize. So I decided to forget about the incident. Tbh, I was still kind of scared of him. Every single he had his appointment, I used to get extremely anxious (shaky hands, shivers and sweats). Whenever I assist at the back with the therapist, my hands will shake badly.\n\nA couple of months later, I had to cancel his massage appointment again. I did call him an hour ago again. He was upset but he didn't start yelling at me this time. He said he would come in even tho there is no therapist there. He did came in. He was laughing and jokingly asked what he should do now ( multiple times). He kept insisting that he could drop me home today ( again multiple times). I told me that I would be fine on my own. I was getting a little annoyed by him so I might said something rude to him. Since he kept on insisting, I was starting to get creeped out. I am a huge overthinker so I think I might reading too much into it. In the end, he said that he was just joking and he was forcing me or something. He sat in our waiting room and talked with me for 45 minutes. He was upset about how he could have worked extra if I called him a bit earlier. I felt stupid about this and how I was letting people walk over me and have zero confidence in myself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nToday, my coworker called me and said that he left for another clinic since the other clinic called to ask for his details about his insurance and treatments. Since he was with us for such a long time, it made her wonder why would he leave. It didn't happen with past front desk people. I might be overthinking or something. I do have a feeling that it could have been because I might have been a little rude last time.\n\nThis whole thing is making me nauseous. I don't have any friends or anyone I can share it with. I don't have any family here too. I am living entirely alone.  My anxiety has been bad lately and it's suffocating now. I just wanted to vent it out. Thank you for reading it.\n\n&#x200B;",

Im not judging you, I myself cry easily, but honestly, you cant have a clear head and be efficient when you feel like this. You might want to see a doctor. \n\nOtherwise, make sure you get enough sleep, healthy nutrition, exersise - any kind. Hot showers. Food helps me A LOT to quickly get myself to do stuff, but thats how I gained lots of weight.\n\nAlso, I try to arrange meetings with friends, even if I feel like its the end if the world and I dont have time and don't feel like it. Just getting distracted and focus on other people and get out of my head helps. I always feel a bit better afterwards.",

Maybe change how you talk about it with them a little bit and just let them know ahead of time that you are just wanting to talk through what you are feeling and not necessarily wanting them to fix it for you. This will take the pressure off of both of you and make it be a less stressful thing I think.

I also take l-theanine, apigenin, and magnesium bisglycinate (you can find them together in some forms).  Sleep hygiene is extremely important.  Getting direct sunlight into your naked eyes first thing in the morning is crucial for daily resetting your circadian rhythm (at least 30 minutes).  Turn off the lights in your house a few hours before bed.  Light candles instead.  Make sure to be in bed before 10pm.  Sleep has a direct impact on the level of anxiety I have so it\u2019s important to focus on it.  I pray you will find relief.  Anxiety is terrible without the sleep issues which can come from it.",

Fine I'll share the details I shared about being forced to eat food my mom spit up out her mouth as punishment when I was 11, how I was forced to eat food in restroom infront of my sis diapers, my parents spitting in my mouth, and how my dad would do things to purposely anger me, being whooped with sex music on, things Like that and I just haven't been able to recover from sharing things like that and not get the support I needed, maybe wouldn't hurt so much if I wasn't still struggling with homelessness and if those same ppl that tried to help me didn't ghost me and cut me out of their life without any explanation, idk it hurts so much makes me feel like I'm a joke, I was treated like I was a joke by my parents and now life treats me like a joke just wish I was dead honestly.",

I have years of build up from repressed emotions from my childhood, my mother passing, the neglect, the emotional abuse and horrible experiences with drugs. How alone I was. I am experiencing severe anxiety, dpdr and agoraphobia to the point where I can't even step outside without having a panic attack and questioning my existence. And I've tried exposure therapy but sitting outside for like 30 min a day but it doesn't get easier. Only time I feel somewhat normal is when I'm locked into to music, movies or video games. And even then I struggle with that. I've had like 2 minutes of relief from this fucking hell. I can't get meds or therapy because of the agoraphobia, anxiety, dpdr.\r  \n\r  \nI've tried accepting these feelings and be like, \"This is temporary and you will get to live a happy, healthy life soon.\" But that's usually short-lived and I go back to the existential thoughts surrounding my existence and thinking that I don't exist. I forget who and where I am every morning. I'm confused. Terrified and usually have a panic attack. I know this is all fueled by trauma and anxiety. My parents (Dad and Stepmum) are giving me shit for \"being lazy\" and \"Not leaving my room\" But this is the only place in the world where I feel as if I have some level of safety. I don't feel safe in my body. The hardest part of my day, and I'm not even kidding is leaving my room and eating dinner. It sounds insane but leaving my room feels like I'm going to go crazy or drop dead.\r  \n\r  \nI try sitting with my feelings, but it is so intense I can't handle it, that's why the DPDR is there. I have to remind myself that I exist, constantly.\r  \n\r  \nAnyway, I just needed to get this off my chest, have a good one :)",

For example today I was in english and I was crying because I thought my paragraph was terrible and that I was so behind, after class my teacher said its actually really good and she had no doubt that I can do it. I remember in history I was the top of my class, I studied so much I answered all the questions until when I went to sleep my dream was just doing history but I still cried after the test because I thought it wasn\u2019t good enough. I\u2019ve had 2 mental breakdowns because I got a B in english. I never thought I was enough, I don\u2019t know if I will or can but I know that me crying everyday over not being perfect is using up other peoples time. The thing is, my idea of being worthy means getting a 98 atar and becoming a aerospace engineer with a masters but I think I\u2019m driving myself crazy. in year 7 I would have been so happy with a B but now if i get anything less than an A than I have a mental breakdown.

If they are qualified to prescribe you anxiety medication however, I still recommend getting a second opinion from a psychiatrist. \n\nThe important thing is not that you currently feel fine. The point is you learn strategies, and have a support system so that if you DO go through it again, you have expertise, medication and support in your tool belt. It won\u2019t be awkward, i promise. Share your past experiences and let them help you, that\u2019s what they\u2019re there for. \n\nGo for future you. That\u2019s all you can do that\u2019s 100% going to help you. It\u2019s okay to be afraid but I promise taking the first step is the best way to beat that fear.",

        "body": "I saw a post from earlier today about klonopin but it was locked. Many comments demonized benzo use, as usual. It's basically if Satan and Hitler had a baby and converted it into a tablet.\n\n\nI've take a low dose of Klonopin essentially daily for many years now. I've posted about it here before but not in awhile. I've posted my story, which I'll briefly tell again:\n\n\nAnxiety forever due to I believe genetic reasons and bullying growing up. Depression was there as well. In 2013 it boiled over into panic attacks and I've never been the same. I believe it was due to personal stress + first responder stress + financial stress + alcohol abuse + high caffeine intake.\n\n\nSince then I've tried two dozen mental health medications for my symptoms which are anxiety, depression, brain fog, OCD and such. SSRIs helped take the edge off but chronic anxiety remained right beneath the surface. These other meds caused many other side effects from sexual dysfunction to weight gain to exacerbation of dissociation and anhedonia. I've even tried Spravato, which was tedious.\n\n\nAdditionally I've tried other avenues. Therapy (on number 4), supplements (Ex: L-Theanine, Taurine, probiotics, Lithium Orotate, methylfolate, and much more), hormone therapy (diagnosed low T and am on TRT), meditation, and more.\n\n\nKlonopin is the only thing that helps adequately. I don't feel GREAT and still suffer daily, especially with dissociation, but klonopin makes it more tolerable. I try to not take it and power through and I regret it every single time. So what're my choices? Take it and live a more tolerable life so I can work, be present for my family, and be able to merely go shopping without feeling super dizzy and disoriented OR suffer? \n\n\nI don't abuse it recreationally, nor have I ever. I don't use illicit drugs. I don't use marijuana. I don't drink alcohol. I just want klonopin and to use it as prescribed without being demonized by others. I don't even take my full dose of .5mg, I usually take a half in the morning and maybe another quarter or half mid day as needed.\n\n\nI dont think it should be the first plan of attack on anxiety, I get that. But when someone has exhausted the \"safer\" options then this should be allowed without question. How medications pcer the past decade went from them being thrown at you with ease to being super strict isn't OK. For example, pain meds. I had spine surgery and they gave me 4 pain pills.\n\n\nSo please don't judge.",

                "body": "I've also been on a shit ton of different non-controlled meds that didn't work, or made me have bad side effects. Hell, I was prescribed Xanax at one point years back and had paradoxical effects from it where I actually got agitated and angry anytime I took it and it stopped when I stopped the prescription. Klonopin has been one of the few things to kind of control my anxiety to the point where I don't feel like I'm in a constant state of panic or actively having a panic attack.\n\nLike you, I'm on an as-needed prescription for Klonopin as well. It is helpful and allows me to work very part-time (and I can actually come into work sometimes, whereas I was having panic attacks preventing me from coming into work prior; I was even having them when working remotely). But it does make me a little tired, more talkative (I don't like this), and I do notice some memory issues in the short-term, which I really wish didn't happen. But these side effects help to make me not want to take it much more than at most a couple times a week, or I take half or a quarter of a pill when I do. I don't have any cravings or a drive to take it, but I haven't ever had that happen to me with any medication I've been on, luckily.\n\nI understand benzos are not ideal in the long-term, especially daily usage. But there is a place for as-needed usage. Not everyone is out here getting addicted. I feel for those who do, but that is obviously not the experience of everyone who is on these medications. Seeing people literally say \"they are poison all the time in any dosage!\" is strange.",

You build a tolerance fast and it doesn\u2019t wane for years if ever. There\u2019s a chance your daily use just holds off a rebound effect of withdrawal and that\u2019s relatively soothing considering the opposite is pretty bad. \n2. Benzos are one of 2 major substances that can cause death if withdrawal isn\u2019t properly managed, the other being alcohol. \n3. Benzos are extremely addictive for many and a lot of people are prone to abusing them. Addiction isn\u2019t a choice people just make because it sounds so fun. \n\nI use klonopin for emergencies, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right to completely demonize them, but we shouldn\u2019t be using them daily for years and years. \n\nIt\u2019s not fun. Anxiety isn\u2019t fun, but benzos aren\u2019t the cure long-term. \n\nThis isn\u2019t me judging you, it\u2019s just an honest disagreement.

I\u2019ve had anxiety for seventeen years, but only been prescribed meds for a year and a half, but in that time, I\u2019ve tried 4 or 5. I started on bupropion but it gave me horrendous anxiety day in and day out and I gave it two months to see if it might wane, but it didn\u2019t. Then, I tried Sertraline and it worked alright but I was still getting so anxious it made it hard to function day to day so I then tried escitalopram and it was even less effective than sertraline so I switched back to that. Once I wanted to try something else, the only option left with the program I\u2019m using (Hims&Hers) was duloxetine. Something I should note is that I struggle to take pills in general, but I\u2019m especially useless when it comes to capsules. I know they\u2019re generally preferred by people but I need to be able to drink water, slip the pill in my mouth and swallow while I look down and the fact that it floated to the roof of my mouth hindered me. All this to say, I\u2019m back on Sertraline at 100 mg. In addition to this, I have been on citalopram but that was years ago at this point, however I have been taking mirtazapine to help me sleep for several years now and it\u2019s the only thing that helps sometimes. I\u2019m having a really hard time finding a psychiatrist on my insurance but I really need to get my mental health in check. I\u2019ve been unemployed for almost three months and thinking about going back gives me really bad anxiety but I need to do it to be able to work. Once I finally do get an appointment with a psychiatrist, I want to request something like Xanax or Klonopin because these ones I\u2019ve been on don\u2019t cut it. I don\u2019t enjoy the things I used to anymore and I\u2019ve developed pretty severe agoraphobia from being stuck in my apartment since I lost my job and I have this irrational fear that something bad will happen if I leave my house, even though I know it won\u2019t. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s important to mention but I have phobic anxiety centered around emetaphobia (fear of vomit and vomiting) so that\u2019s already a challenge to live with on its own, and I developed depression about five years ago that\u2019s only gotten worse with time.

While less problematic, they do have side effects. Some nasty ones depending on the person. One being increased suicide risk.\n\n\nI wish cannabis worked for me. I used to smoke recreationally back in college and I felt quite good with it. Motivated, everything felt more enjoyable - from food to music to movies and more. Sadly it did end up making me more anxious. We are all different so I'm not saying thatll happen to you. I also tried medical marijuana about 2-3 years ago now and it helped sometimes. I figured since it was controlled and I knew the ratios of CBD to THC and the strains I'd be better off. Ultimately it made me anxious too often to use, sadly. It was also stupid expensive and the dispensary was quite far."

When I started having panic attacks, I forgot how it was to feel normal. Clonazepam helped reset me so to speak, then you can build from there.",

Other options?\n\nI have always had vivid dreams and have acted out verbally and somewhat physically for as long as I can remember.  In fact, I also can lucid dream, which is really cool when it happens.  But the RBD is a persistent problem that worries me.  Because 1. I foresee a neurological condition in my future (my Dad passed away from Lewy-Body Dementia, and my looking back my grandfather probably had a form of Parkinson's) which I know I can't prevent 2. I worry about hurting my wife and 3. Am I destine for a life on Clonazepam?\n\nMy physical actions range from running and kicking to hitting, slapping, biting, and throwing myself out of bed.  I don't sleep walk.  The worst injury to myself, so far, is when I threw myself out of bed and busted my face on the nightstand.  The worst injury to my wife has been the bite on the back of her arm; generally the other \"batterings\" she catches as I become active in my sleep so far so good.\n\nThe clonazepam does a fairly good job of controlling my RBD but roughly 1 - 2 times a month I still experience some sort of event.  There have been times (like this week) when I have accidentally forgotten to put my clonazepam in my med box.  The good news is my anxiety and tinnitus are so high by day 2 of withdrawal that I immediately know the problem.  The bad news, the withdrawal sucks both physically and cognitively for a couple days.  I am also concerned about the long term use of it.\n\nI've tried melatonin in the past without much affect.  Is there anything else out there that people have used to combat this besides clonazepam?  I've recently transitioned off of Effexor XR to Lexapro for reasons related to my anxiety, but I was hoping the RBD might get better since Effexor is know for weird dreams an potentially exacerbating RBD.\n\nThanks in advance!",

He is alert, cognizant and creative; engaged in life. \nI, however,  have taken it for the same amount of time on and off.( Mostly on)  But have tolerance to 0.5 and vivid weird dreams every night when on it. I am also much more articulate when off k pin. \nI have a lot of experince with tapering off. I went off it once for 4 years and twice for 2 years. Every time I go back on its because I'm nervous about dating a new girl.\n\nSo it's possible  to get off if I've done it... You have too accept that you will suffer for a solid  month after taper : no sleep , walk around in surreal state like your in Nightmare on Elm Street.  Creepy stuff..and stiff muscles back, gruin pain stiff neck jaw...But...if you can indore  this,once you're  off  you will sing  in shower sing in car.. things will smell better..youl be Happy!  And no longer have nightmares. \n\nThe worst day of detox is 14,15 when it's finally out of system. \n\n\nMy most recent  I attempt  to get vlean..I went into a rehab because I had begun to drink and do other drugs after being alcohol free for 28 years. I quit in 89' AA was great to me! NA does not want to here your are on o.5 mlg of kolonopin and take it as prescribed. To them you are not clean.no at me will sponcer you..\n\nRehabs not the place to go to get of benzos.. because they make hideous tranquilizers readily available specifically Sariquil and Trazadone....far more sedating drugs than k pin. \n\nAfter 25k of own money..and 5 weeks at Handly center in fla.. off k pin..I could not snapp out of Sariquil fog...felt weak like I was going to fall.. I called shrink and sadly went back on..k pin \nBack on 2 weeks now and hate myself.",

        "body": "\nHi everyone. I have a ton of health anxiety and for the past 2 months I\u2019ve been getting which is told by my optometrist and ophthalmologist that it\u2019s occular migraines. I\u2019ve never had migraines in my entire life and the first time I had it I saw a spot (like looking at the sun for too long) that grew into a brighter spot in my peripheral vision. This lasted about 15 mins and I felt fine after. \n\nSince then, this has seemed to be a weekly occurrence. The same thing happens everytime. However, 2x the left side of my face felt numb. And only 1x it happened in my right eye (usually left), and then the left eye an hour later. Sometimes I get a headache after but it\u2019s not too often. If anything I feel foggy sometimes but then other times I\u2019m fine after. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s just my anxiety adding to it. It also seems to be occurring in only one eye which I\u2019ve read is a retinal migraine and more rare. This made me worry more. \n\nI am 22 and not on any birth control pill, just have an IUD. My doctor told me they are usually nothing to worry about but he is concerned about the frequency I am getting them at so I am getting an MRI next week. Until then, I am freaked out, can\u2019t stop googling, and always thinking the worst. Has anyone been through this and can anyone reassure me? I tried to figure out many triggers and can\u2019t seem to find what it is. I\u2019ve paid close attention to caffeine, diet, exercise, sleep, stress (which I thought was the main cause since this happened before I moved across the country and started a new job). However, I\u2019m not always stressed when it happens and have been more stressed before. I even started taking magnesium which I thought would help but I still get them. I don\u2019t know what to do! ",

The strong feelings of anxiety still lingers within me and make feel like I'm having the symptoms of a panic attack, and I don't why? Like it's irrational to feel that way and yet my body does it while my mind remains calm? I don't understand it, if anyone else experienced this please tell me and share what strategies you used to overcome it because it's really hard to get through a day while it feels like your having a panic attack over something you know isn't something to be anxious over.",

Even though I understand the importance of an internship and how it's kind of compulsory for you to get a full time job, I am absolutely terrified at the thought of relocation. I know its only for 3 months but a lot of internships open are in other states. Heck I am even scared to move away from my city.\n\nI live with my parents and wouldn't want it another way. I have had the nastiest form of anxiety since the past 2 years where I would have panic attacks sitting in a classroom and palpitations while lying down. I am trying to get over this now by taking more on-campus classes, focusing on learning, and talking to people. But just as I am working slowly to feeling better, jobs and internships have come giving me stress and anxiety again and hard. I cannot even think of living alone in a new city, I will not be able to learn anything and just be in a survival mode. I don't know what to do? I really really don't want to move but I also don't want my career to be a failure. \n\nThere a lot of opportunities about 40 mins from where I am but just like other internships, they also have a lot applicants. If someone approaches me with a opportunity to apply to an out-of-state location, I feel like a jerk for not applying but at the same time not having the courage to apply. Has anyone been in this situation before? What did you do?\n\nThank you.",

While the bus was moving, a man got up from his seat, he had a seat and then got up walked over to me and motioned like he wanted me to stand up and then leaned on top of me. He got off at the same stop as me.\n\n2) I was sitting in a common area studying at a table in the corner. There was a group of men (40s or 50s) and one repositioned his chair to be on a diagonal when I sat down. Over the next hour, each time I looked up this man was staring at me which was made weirder by the fact that he was engaging in conversation with 3 others and wasn\u2019t making eye contact with them.\n\n3) I had 2 back to back classes and had to rush across campus, when I was walking to my second class I noticed a guy I had seen earlier was walking behind me. He followed me into the building of my second class and then walked away. I didn\u2019t think much of it until I left class and went to buy some pens and he was sitting at a table facing me when I walked out. The last straw was when I went to get a coffee and 5 minutes after I sat down he sat next to me. I called my boyfriend and went to my next class and had him pick me up.\n\nI feel so unsafe and I don\u2019t know what to do\n",

        "body": "I\u2019ve had severe health anxiety for about 2 years now. It is all revolved around my stomach. It is a continuos cycle where if I feel sick my anxiety rockets up, or if I feel anxious my nausea gets really bad. It\u2019s like at this point if my nausea went and didn\u2019t come back, I\u2019d actually be able to cope with the anxiety and combat it!!\n\nI struggle to eat properly every day and feel really deflated and horrible. I try to avoid leaving the house as I worry that I\u2019ll feel sick and be sick (I have emetaphobia). Stupidly I\u2019ve also never been sick due to anxiety, only ever if I have had a stomach bug. \n\nThis feeling constantly on a daily is really draining me and I feel myself giving up. My boyfriend is really supportive and caring, but I can\u2019t help the intrusive thoughts of \u201che\u2019ll get bored eventually and leave\u201d. I feel like my family really want me to get better and I try, but non stop let them down. I miss my old life. Anxiety free and I did everything! I was a gym girl and loved working out and now I barely can due to my nausea. \n\nI was prescribed cyclizine and it was the only thing that helped my nausea. It just sucks as I know I shouldn\u2019t take a pill like that daily. I have almost become dependent on it and take it whenever I need to. \n\nHas anyone got any advice? I could explain so much more, but it would just become a book! I just need help on how to stop this nausea long term and be able to get on with my life again. I am desperate to keep my relationships with my friends and especially my amazing boyfriend. Anyone that can help it will change my life honestly!

I too have never been sick from anxiety, but it\u2019s what plagues my mind the most when I start getting really anxious or have a panic attack. And then my mind gets to play the fun game of what came first: anxiety or nausea/upset stomach?\n\nSomething that has helped me recently is recognizing that there is zero evidence for me getting sick from anxiety. It hasn\u2019t happened, and that can give some leverage into conquering  the anxiety, which will also hopefully aid the nausea as well.\n\nI also just recently took a Xanax for a panic attack, and once it kicked in my nausea was gone, which for me is more proof of how much the mind can affect the stomach. If anxiety is the root cause of the nausea, that is the issue to tackle. \n\nHave you tried any anxiety medication or anti-depressants? I just recently got on Prozac, and though it\u2019s making anxiety worse at the start, I\u2019m seeing the light at the end of the tunnel that this will help cure my anxiety and this the nausea/stomach symptoms that accompany it.",

I feel like that would ruin me. Also it\u2019s the fact that they are soooo bad for you. It just scares me. Then how do I come off of them without getting awful withdrawal symptoms. I dread that the most. \nPlease let me know your thoughts though. What kind of symptoms did you get from the antidepressants? Also would be good to mention, I did get given sertraline a while ago, but just never took it due to my fear!"

                "body": "Here is the stuff that worked for me. I literally could not bring myself to drive after being in an accident and had to work from nothing so you might be already past some of these stages.   \n- Starting out by driving out of my driveway and literally to the next street corner and back. \n\n- After that I would drive around my neighborhood, going further than my street but not so far that I couldn't park the car and walk home and have someone else come get the car. I found this helped to reassure myself that I was never going to be \"forced\" to drive. \n\n- Once I got more comfortable I would drive to the grocery store. I would make small trips. I also found it helped to either have someone in the car or talk to someone on the phone as I was driving, so I did not feel alone and they could reassure me if I needed it. \n\n- Once I was able or had to make bigger and longer trips by myself, I would always look at the map and choose the route I felt most comfortable on. Either less traffic, streets I knew, etc. Even if this meant going on little baby side streets and extending my trip by 30 minutes, as long as I got to my destination I did not care. \n\n- I was very nervous to drive on the highway. I started doing that again by getting on the highway at a non peak time and driving until the next exit and getting off. It was harder knowing you can't pull over, but I would tell myself to just go one exit. \n\n- It was hardest to get used to driving on the highway, for sure. Once I got comfortable doing it, I would try to take the highway on my longer trips but still plan an alternate route, getting off at an exit and taking small roads if I needed to.\n\n  \nIt definitely takes time. Don't be afraid to literally just pull over and sit in the car for an hour if you have to. I would really recommend not driving if you are having an anxiety/panic attack. Just pull over, wait it out. Distract yourself. You want being in the car to be a good experience.",

The last two times I've seen her she says that I look tired. \n\nThe first time I didn't mind but this time it's really upset me and I honestly feel she's trying to upset me. Especially as I got up and made me self presentable today, like I thought I looked good!\n\nI've already put things into place because of her toxic behaviour, I've reduced my contact with her. And I put headphones on so she can't drag me into conversations. \n\nLike I said, she's toxic and always has been, but she's never attacked my physical appearance.\n\nMy plan next week, if she says it again, is to tell her that \"I'm not tired, this is the way I look\". I will say that to her as I know until I do she'll continue it. \n\nBut I just feel really sad and anxious about it. Part of me wants to go into tomorrow to get it over and done with.  I don't want to put in a complaint or anything I will add that.\n\nAnyway, any advice/support is welcomed x\n\nEdit: I was so anxious I came into work today and confronted her. I first told her that she looked tired, and she was insulted by this response, I could see it on her face that she wasn't happy with what I'd said. I then said I'm sorry have I upset you, it's not pleasant to comment on people's appearance is it.  She said oh it's OK, I said well I wouldn't be ok with it, I think it's very rude. She was quiet for an hour, and didn't say a word to me, I think she got the hint. I'm going to be direct if she ever says I look tired again. ",

I first told her that she looked tired, and she was insulted by this response, I could see it on her face that she wasn't happy with what I'd said. I then said I'm sorry have I upset you, it's not pleasant to comment on people's appearance is it.  She said oh it's OK, I said well I wouldn't be ok with it, I think it's very rude. She was quiet for an hour and didn't say a word to me, I think she got the hint. I'm going to be direct if she ever says I look tired again!

My anxiety feels more like a physical reaction rather than mental. I could be so happy and excited and nothings wrong but my chest and stomach area feel anxious. Anxiety for me doesn\u2019t feel like an emotion. Most times I cant pin point where, when, and how i started feeling anxious, just all of a sudden i am. I\u2019m not scared to go outside or talk to people. i\u2019m not afraid of something happening in the future. i\u2019m not overthinking things. Well not always at least. My anxiety is 1000% worse when i have something to focus on. Like a test question i know i got wrong, or a vacation coming up, or if i know someone\u2019s upset with me or if i\u2019m upset with someone. which makes sense , that\u2019s the normal anxiety i hear of. but majority of the time, it feels like there\u2019s genuinely no reason and i just feel sick. I think it\u2019s why for so long I didn\u2019t think i actually had GAD because it  came in waves and there would be weeks where i won\u2019t be anxious at all and then all of a sudden it comes back EVEN THO NOTHING HAPPENED. people keep advising me to be aware of what my triggers are and to understand why i feel anxious but it genuinely feels like there is no reason, even tho i\u2019m told there is always a reason\n\nDoes anyone get what I mean? And how do i fix it? ",

I remember waking up every morning and puking before school like a habit. I felt so alone and back in 2011 there were zero articles online that related. \n\nI still feel so alone with how my body processes my anxiety.

                "body": "I have the same thing, the only difference is that I went through a period of having \u201cnormal anxiety\u201d 3 years ago (panic attacks, emotional anxiety, etc.). Now I\u2019m back to my \u201cnormal anxiety\u201d, which is what you have as well. IBS/GAD is a result for me as well.\n\nSucks because I\u2019m 28M, and every other thing in my life is perfect\u2026..\n\nAnyway, your conscious mind is strong enough to realize there is no threat lurking around you, but your subconscious mind believes otherwise. \n\n\u201cAnxiety\u201d has been built into us since we were in caves, it was meant as a protection mechanism. If a lion entered your cave, you would start sweating to be harder to grab onto, your heart rate would increase to pump more blood, your lungs would open up for more air (this is why you feel like you\u2019re not breathing during a panic attack. You actually are breathing better, but you can\u2019t feel your breathing as much because your airways are more open), and your stomach would get ready to empty itself to run away. \n\nThe anxiety symptoms you have are a result of our bodies thinking there is a threat near us, but there just isn\u2019t, and that\u2019s what the actual \u201cdisorder\u201d is. \n\nYour supposed to have anxiety, just not the disorder part lol. \n\nThe solution for people like us is to breathe in a way you would never breathe if there was a threat around. If you close your eyes and breathe very slowly, you may feel a little weird for a few seconds, but do it for a bit. You\u2019ll likely feel your heart beat at first, then you\u2019ll slowly feel it less and less, and your stomach will also feel better.",

        "body": "From the very first panic attack I had that triggered the last 3 years of anxiety I had, I've always felt like brain inflammation or sinus inflammation is an underlying cause of mine specifically and have heard similar but sporadic stories from others online. My anxiety came out of nowhere and I didn't have a history of any mental illness and wasn't even experiencing any stress at the time I had my first panic attack (that triggered my GAD). I just woke up in the middle of the night with a crazy panic attack and couldn't breathe through my nose. When I feel anxiety, my sinuses are almost always closed/inflamed and I have that sinus pressure feeling behind my eyes and above the roof of my mouth and brain fog/head in a daze feeling like someone hooked up an air compressor to my head. But never have any green sinus discharge or mucous or anything like that. I also haven't had any neurological symptoms indicative of a brain tumor either. And it's not just an anxiety/hypochondriac symptom either, my nose literally almost whistles when I try to breathe through it when I have anxiety. I've even shoved an ear inspection camera up my nose to look at my upper nasal passage when I feel anxiety and when I don't, and you can visually see the inflammation. \n\nDoes anyone else feel this way? Sometimes, when I take a strong anti-inflammatory or even 2 advil, it helps with the anxiety too and makes me feel normal for a short period of time.\n\nI have also tried Adderall (before the shortage) and felt like that SIGNIFICANTLY decreased the inflammation in my head. I almost enjoyed the anti-inflammatory aspect of it better than how it helped me get stuff done for my ADHD that I was also experiencing heavily at the time.\n\n&#x200B;",

I even spent a whole day in bed just feeling every twitch that would happen, and they didn\u2019t seem to go away. The only symptom I don\u2019t seem to have is the eye pain.

        "body": "Hey guys! It's my first post here and I'm sorry that it's so long and it's a vent one, but I really felt like getting this off my chest and talking to someone who might have similar experiences.   \nSo, I (23, F) got diagnosed with GAD (generalized anxiety disorder) a bit after the pandemic, which was a horrible experience for me, as a close person passed away, and I felt very isolated.   \nBasically I am having severe anxiety attacks over whatever my brain feels like it's time to get stressed over on that particular day (health, job, uni, family, friendships, etc) It has been a wild ride, but I've been working with a therapist for the past 2 years and things have definitely gotten better. However, lately I'm noticing a new pattern that won't go away and it's driving me crazy...  \nLately, I spend an immense amount of time and energy worrying about some of my past actions and feeling humiliated. Here are several random scenarios that are on the top of my head right now:    \n\\- About a time I treated a person badly in high school and said very nasty things to them because we fought. I regret how I acted towards them and apologized years later. I recently noticed they have removed me from all social media and I almost had a panic attack because I realized this person will always remember me as a horrible human being and probably will never forgive me.  \n\\- The time that an ex partner hurt me very much and treated me horribly, despite this I desperately tried to get back together with them, I realized months later that it was totally not worth it, I regretted doing that a lot, but what worries me is that person will forever remember how I called them, cried and begged and in their eyes I probably have no dignity.  \n\\- The time that I went to a birthday party and I had maybe a little too much to drink which made me bubbly and I overshared some personal information with a person that is not very close to me and I feel like I overwhelmed them and now they will forever remember this and also they could have told our mutual acquaintances about the personal stuff I shared.  \nAnd more and more and more. The 'funny' thing is ALL of the things that I keep 'reliving' in my head happened at least 2 years ago, some are even from about 10 years ago! I don't speak to any of the people involved, they are not part of my life... And my life is actually going pretty good right now - I have been working on my own business, I started a great relationship with an amazing person, I am eating healthy, working out. The problem is whenever one of those thoughts occurs, it's preventing me from sleeping properly, eating, thinking about how I am a horrible human being and that everyone thinks so, and soon my new partner will notice it too, etc. It comes with all the usual symptoms (sweating, heart palpitations, crying, shaking.   \nI'm having severe social anxiety where I postpone going out with people for weeks and I am panicking about posting on social media because I feel like someone would notice I posted and start discussing me and all of those things.  \n   \nWhen the anxiety wears off, I start seeing things more clear-minded, I realize that people don't care as much as my brain is forcing me to believe. I know that I am not some special person, I am not the center of anyone's universe, half of the things I am worrying about the other people involved have probably forgotten about or definitely don't think about it on a daily basis like I do. Or maybe they don't even think of it in a negative way. Maybe the person from high school was just clearing out their friend list and removing people they don't speak to. Maybe my ex partner realized that people sometimes act irrationally when they are emotional. Maybe the person from the party is actually glad I trusted them with some information or they were also drunk and forgot about all of it the next day. But for some reason I am convinced that everyone secretly hates me, discusses me behind my back, etc.  \n\n\nHave you guys ever had such an experience and how did you get over it? :(",

                "body": "Hi, I recovered from GAD and I'd say I know well how to work with it. \n\nI think the best way to improve this fixation on what happened in the past is to \"face it\" in your head. Meaning look at what happened for exactly what happened with no sugar coating or thinking it was worse that it was. You just need to look at it with a cold approach and then accept that it happened that way and there is no way around that fact. You must not seek any comfort in it nor any conclusion how you're a bad person for doing it or anything like that. Just as I said, look at what happened and accept that it happened. For example if you think it was embarrassing or mean, accept it was embarrassing or mean. This approach leads to your brain slowly stopping bringing it up. \n\nAnd with the fear of everyone hating you, it's crucial to make peace with the fact that someone might hate you and you can never really know who for sure. It's about making peace with uncertainty, which is the core of the issue. That goes for other worries from uncertainty. Anxiety demands the kind of reassurance which doesn't really exist. I mean you can't really find out how people don't hate you. But anxiety will want you to keep searching for it, causing tons of new anxiety in the process. That's why the solution is to not search for it and make peace with the fact how you can never find out. Doing this also leads to slowly stopped being worried about it.",

As I worked through a sobriety program, we spoke often about guilt and regret. I came to understand that I needed to learn from my mistakes so that I would not repeat them, but if I wanted to live a life of purpose and meaning I had to live in the present. I wanted to be of service to my family, friends, community, and co-workers. I wanted to live out a belief system that focused on love and forgiveness, and that meant forgiving myself. Holding on to past mistakes brought nothing positive to my life, or to the life of others. I used guided meditation to help let go of guilt and shame. The Honest Guys Channel on YouTube has an excellent meditation on guilt and shame. There are other mental health apps. with similar meditations. I have learned to apologize when I do something wrong in the present, and try to get a little better each day. In AA we say progress not perfection. We all have regrets, but we can put down the past, and make a better future. I wish you all the best.",

The potential for abuse is simply too high, as is the pharmacological body danger. If you need them then a doctor should get them to you, but it's hard to fault them when they are the ones at risk if a patient's use of benzos could mean their license or prison time."

                "body": "After seeing dozens of psychiatrists to my detriment, I've learned to be suspicious of ones who \"don't prescribe\" based on cultural or legal classifications. It's one thing for a doctor to be extremely conservative, or for the question to not come up, and quite another for a doctor to effectively rule out an entire class of very current drugs for which there's no exact substitute as a matter of policy. This is especially true if the doctor does not prescribed controlleds at all.\n\nThere are a few reasons my doctors have done this and none of them are good. One, the clinic didn't want or couldn't handle the liability, in which case they were not offering the full service they were more than happy to charge for. Two, the clinic was frequently targeted by drug seekers or dealers and was unable to trust their own clientele, which meant that honest patients were being penalized. Three, the clinic had a history of irresponsible prescribing and was passing the consequences onto their patients instead of taking responsibility. In all of these cases I was seriously harmed or endangered by the alternative.\n\nIt's not just about the benzos. It's about putting your health in the hands of a medical professional who isn't equipped to handle these widely used, essential medications. If a doctor can't be trusted with diazepam, can you really trust them with something you're going to be taking every day?",

That was the only thing that made me feel balanced before I went to the psychiatrist. \n\nAlso, find a new doctor!

I just started seeing a new one at an entirely new practice, and I was super nervous because I use stimulant medication, trazodone for sleep, and anti-anxiety meds as needed. I was terrified she would think I was medication-seeking. But apparently, she can see in my records my history of medication prescriptions or refills or something, because she could see how infrequently I refill my sleep and anxiety meds. She actually gave me a little shit because she could see that I don't go through my ADHD med as quickly as I should, meaning I'm skipping too many days. The office now follows up with me regularly to see if I'm good with \\*all\\* of my meds, and it's such a relief to be treated like the responsible medication-taker that I am. I hope you can find something similar!",

Please I ask to be gentle with your opinions or comments, as what I\u2019m about to share is a sensitive topic to me at least and I\u2019m working through it. Words of encouragement or your own experiences would be helpful.\n\nI\u2019ll make try to make a long story short. I have had my first baby last year June and 8 months PP currently. I\u2019ve been an aunty for 12 years, and I\u2019m so proud to be officially a mum to my own child even though he wasn\u2019t expected. \n\nEver since LO was born, his fathers side mostly, my husbands mom (late 60s) and sister(early 20s) always see my son more so his son and apart of their family then mine. His sister recently came to visit (as hubbys family lives a plane ride away) and some of her comments this time around acknowledging I\u2019m my LOs mom.\n\nI don\u2019t have the best relationship with my husbands mom, and with his sister it has been  good in the past, but now being a mum I do feel I\u2019m different; where relationships around me are different now as well.\n\nI\u2019m still going through the process of speaking up, feeling confident as my sons mum and our bond, as well as expressing my core emotions. \n\n\nHowever, I have been noticing after I FT with my husbands mom, during & after she visited back when I was 2 months PP, his sister visits also during & after my anxiety goes through the roof and it\u2019s only with them.\nI did have anxiety before getting pregnant, but it was more at bay and barley noticeable with my 5x a week workouts and working. Of course now that\u2019s not really my reality for right now. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I feel like this with them because of the comments they have said and I let slide, things they said, no actions don\u2019t match with their word, if it\u2019s from treatment from early PP, my boundaries not being understood.\n\nIt\u2019s always thoughts of them trying to ice me out that comes to my mind and being worried about my bond with my LO, because it\u2019s my husbands family first grandchild/nephew. So they don\u2019t really know the possible function/boundaries we as a nuclear family may have and want respected. Which I understand the excitement, but so far when I have spoken up with the women at least it\u2019s been a problem for them. They come off as I\u2019m making a big deal and ruining their experience with their new title, when I do explain I\u2019m trying to navigate my new experience as well; because we are not having anymore kids.\n\nThe anxiety goes away after a week maybe, but time to time I worry about my bond with my LO.\n\nHave any others felt like this? Did it go away?\n\n ",

        "body": "I've had severe anxiety since I was a child. I threw up almost every day and missed out on so many activities. I would have panic attacks during sleepovers, and before any social events. I missed a recital that I practiced so long for, but I couldn't stop throwing up. I had so many misdiagnoses' - even did a whole treatment for H pylori. Fast forward, I was put on Prozac when I was 13. The vomiting stopped, but the panic attacks didn't. They were less for sure. Then when I went to college, I developed a sort of agoraphobia. I couldn't eat out at restaurants, because I was so afraid I'd get sick. When I'd leave my apartment all I could think of was \"What if I get sick when I'm out and away from home?\" All this kind of stuff. I continued getting treatment and was eventually put on Paxil, which honestly is my biggest lifesaver. The other meds were not doing their job. I was also taking Klonopin twice a day... which helped. Weirdly, I never got addicted because it would simply get rid of my anxiety - I felt nothing else. Then after the age of 21/22, the attacks were less and less. Still had to take Klonopin though if I felt a panic attack coming on. Now I'm 30 and I haven't taken more than five Klonopins in the past 3 years. I can't say I never have panic attacks anymore, but they're so rare at this point. I think that age, CBT, meds and simply practicing mindfulness have allowed me to have a quality of life. I have friends now, I go out, I travel and I finally found purpose. There is hope! It only took me about 26 years. Still on meds with zero side effects, but everyone's different. ",

I feel like I\u2019ve watched my life go by me, never even had a girlfriend, insecurities and anxiety have caused me to ruin relationships that could\u2019ve been fruitful friendships ( with women). Anxiety sucks the joy out of life, I know myself to be driven and ambitious, but the past few years have been me just making mistakes and wasting time, perhaps trying to distract myself from the ever present anxiety. It sucks. And recently I finished school so I have nothing but free time which I can\u2019t use to relax because I\u2019m never chilled, and my drive.. for my goals..my life, it feels like a fire that got put out with a bucket of water and im constantly trying to reignite it. I began having very bad thoughts, thoughts I didn\u2019t want to be thinking, luckily a friend noticed I was being distant and checked up on me, to which I didn\u2019t tell him I was going through this, but him checking up on me made me feel better. Sorry for the vent but, I know the great qualities I have, I feel like I can really excel, but the anxiety, it dims your light man, I hate it",

        "author": "Scrambled-Brainz",
        "timestamp": "2024-02-27 23:43:01",
        "body": "I have found that my anxiety (and possibly my ADHD as well, working with the anxiety) has made me more and more sensitive to particular jokes, even when they are not directed at me personally.\n\nFor me, the big one is jokes about my nationality. Every nationality has its jokes directed at it, usually involving stereotypes. I am sure we have all heard of ones for Americans, British, French, etc.\n\nI grew up in a country where making fun of yourselves and being able to laugh along at self-deprecating humor from others is normal, and I do think it can be a good thing overall.\n\nHowever my anxiety, especially over the last few years, has made me very sensitive to these kinds of jokes. I have always had a low self-esteem, and when I encounter such jokes on a seemingly regular basis online, it gets to me.\n\nMy anxiety tries to convince me that what I see and hear are not jokes, but honest opinions that are directed at me, and worse, that they are in the right in that I'm this weird person who does weird things and sounds weird etc., and that I should feel bad for being of this nationality, as if it were a conscious choice I was making, and am an idiot for being that way.\n\nIn essence, my brain acts as its own personal troll/hater/gaslighter. Especially as I know for a fact that I have never had any such honest opinions or comments thrown at me personally in my life. It really just sucks, for lack of a better way to put it. All it takes is one instance and that can be my day ruined as my brain gets stuck on it.\n\nNaturally, I get really frustrated when this happens and feel defensive like I was actually being attacked or confronted by someone, but I don't get upset so much cause I think they are in the wrong, but because I KNOW it's all in my head. I can still recognize when something is meant as a joke or is an actual comment made out of negative opinions. This goes for everything and not just nationality jokes. I could be watching a live stream or meme video and I see someone, such as the streamer or a commenter, take a dig at my nationality if someone of my nationality showed up in, say, a meme.\n\nI can tell that almost every time this happens there is no actual hate or mean spiritness involved and they make similar jokes for others, it's nothing personal.\n\nBut my brain just doesn't care and just sees it as fuel for the anxiety fire. This kind of reaction can happen for all sorts of things, I just wanted to bring up the jokes because that is where I have been feeling it the most recently. Honestly, I just can't see or be near any kind of arguments, confrontations, sensitive issues, controversies, and of course any 'poking fun at' type jokes etc., as the anxiety just gets going. It has made me too sensitive, far more than I would like to be and to the point it is life-restricting.\n\nThe best thing I can try to do is just avoid potential triggers, but you never know when it could happen so it is very difficult to do. I have tried many different tools and methods to block and hide such stuff, but no filter is perfect of course.\n\nSorry for the wall of text but I just really wanted to get this down somewhere. Does anyone else encounter this kind of thing?\n\nI would really like to know as I often feel very alone with this particular reaction from my anxiety.",
