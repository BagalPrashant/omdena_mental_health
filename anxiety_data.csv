2,Im sorry but reading about other peoples anxiety makes me laugh. ,"I have bad anxiety to dont get me wrong. But reading about wat things set off other people‚Äôs anxiety i find funny. Mostly the catastrophising write ups, cuz i do the exact same thing. I overthink like crazy, but when ur looking at it from an outside perspective ur like ‚Äúwow this poor soul is going nuts cuz their hand was cold haha‚Äù. So it makes me think maybe people who r on the outside of the scenario im catastrophising are thinking the same thing about me. Which makes me think ‚Äúmaybe im just loosing my mind for no reason and its actually not as bad as i think‚Äù. Anxiety is so irrational, but it is comforting to know that there r other people out there dealing with the same thing. I wish we could all just laugh at our problems together."
3,Constantly worried about picture I posted 5 years ago.,"5 years ago I was 17/18, my friend I admired used to post promiscuous pictures of herself all the time. So I wanted to copy her and I posted a promiscuous photo of myself with half my face covered in a dark lighting saying somethingbalong the lines of ‚Äúdump dump or boobies‚Äù on my IG story, then deleted it after 5min but I noticed 100 people saw it. My IG doesn‚Äôt have my real name on it but its something close to my name ish. I wasn‚Äôt fully nude but I was wearing really small shorts and a bra. I was depressed asf and being stupid I know. It was 5 years ago but to this day I worry that someone will repost it in the future. I‚Äôm jn the finance field at a large IB firm and things are going well rn but I worry someone will send a screenshot of this to my employer. I never posted things like this again, just that day I was fking stupid asf and drunk. Do you guys think I will be fired if this was reshared? üòì

Edit: thank you guys you actually make me feel a lot better, in the back of my mind I‚Äôm still worried but I guess the chance of someone keeping it for 5+ years to come and sending to my employer and them actually firing me for it would be pretty low"
4,I hate health anxiety,13 with severe health anxiety. Currently convinced I have lung cancer and I‚Äôm very scared. A slight tickle in my throat that has progressively gotten worse over the last week. I also have right chest pain and back pain near the right shoulder blade. I am so convinced that I have lung cancer right now and nothing is helping. I don‚Äôt know what to do at this point. 
5,I haven't been able to function properly for around Two Months,"I'm 29f, part of me doesn't even know if it is just anxiety, but everyone keeps telling me it is, and I haven't really felt anxiety similar to this since I was a teenager.

I am very fortunate in my life and unfortunate in other ways. To put it mildly, I experienced a lot of loss last year, mostly family, but some friends too. It was quite bizarre, everyone just seemed to be passing away, for different reasons, including my grandfather, who I was very close to. 

I cope by forgetting and bottling things up quite a lot, I have kids, I'm married, and they're all great I don't have any complaints about that, but to put it bluntly, last year was the worst year of my life and, I barely ever cried, I held it in, I even made sure I was healthy and fit as a fiddle and able to be a good mom and person and wife and all that.

Around January, maybe late December I got a lot of Caffeinated Iced Tea, and Mountain Dew, what can I say, I love the stuff. I have never really had a major issue with it, I have always been pretty fit and healthy, never even got chubby or anything, but I was drinking caffeine in excess for around 2 weeks, I'm not really sure why I was doing that, but I was doing it. 

Eventually it lead to a point, I remember the day where I felt weird, I was already having these moments on the caffeine prior to this, this ""weird"" feeling, but it only happened after a sip this time, I thought I was having a heart attack, and I went to the hospital. 

And of course, as you might expect, it was nothing. They ran an EKG, did some blood work, etc, everything was fine. No excess caffeine in the system, nothing, they just recommend to me to stop drinking caffeine so I did.

I stopped drinking caffeine cold turkey, entirely, family never got it for me every again, and I endured, painfully, for weeks and I figured I was just going through caffeine withdrawals, it felt like I was dying, I even ended up in the hospital again, shivering, cold sweats, thinking I was dying, and my vitals of course were fine, and they figured at worse, I just had a sensitivity to caffeine, so at worst I'm just going through some pretty nasty caffeine withdrawals but eventually they'll go away. 

Well they were kind of right, eventually they did, I was able to eat normally again, (I forgot to mention during this entire time I had almost no appetite and was losing weight), but I felt like I was in the recovery phase so to speak, and this was in late January, I started working out slowly but surely, and not pushing it too hard or too crazy. Doing cardio, squats, pushups, etc, I had a routine, I enjoy being active so it was nice to get back to that.

As crazy as this sounds during the withdrawals and anxiety, I couldn't enjoy or do much of anything and to be honest during this time, I ended up developing somewhat of a fear of going outside aswell, and even video games something I enjoy a lot even as a woman,  I just couldn't enjoy, and would even stress me out to the point where I thought I was gonna die. 

Well after my so-called ""recovery"" from the withdrawals I ended up yunno having these moments, where things weren't right, even when I did feel right.

30 minutes of cardio became 25, because when I tried to go past 25 I felt like I was about to have a heart attack, 25 became 15, which became 10, which became nothing.

Doing any workout felt similarly which made me think, God am I, dying? I play a lot of Fortnite actively (I know lol), and I even reached Unreal rank primarily in solos (very stressful) but at a certain point, even casual matches, or even getting chased in a creative map, were pushing me to the point where I felt like I was going to die. 

This has continued to the point of up until a week or two ago where I had my last ""good day"" where I finally thought, maybe all those bad days I was feeling was just PTSD about the caffeine withdrawals and anxiety about that, and on that day I really enjoyed myself and thought I was fine, I did 15 minutes of cardio (which considering the decline was good for me) I did a full workout other than that, played Fortnite, went outside, spent time with my family, enjoyed my life, and then the next day happened, where I tried to do cardio, and it just, I felt like I was going to die.

I couldn't even talk to my husband, I tried, I felt like I was going to die, I sure as hell couldn't play Fortnite, I couldn't even read things, outside was impossible. This has continued to the point where I have been pretty much bedridden and worried that I'm dying for easily over a week now. I have gone to the hospital yesterday, the third time in the last two months, and they ran more extensive tests, even an xray, and they said I was fine.

I even had my mother who is in her 50s with me during that time, and walking outside after all the tests, felt so bad I felt like I was going to die, I had to hold her hand, outside scared me more than anything I feel like I somehow developed some sort of agoraphobia.

I cannot function like this. I cannot take care of my kids, I cannot be a good wife, I cannot enjoy games, I cannot workout and take care of myself, I cannot read manga, I cannot watch shows, I can't enjoy anything, I can't even do anything.

I'm terrified of dying, and everytime I get out of bed I feel so weak, I have lost 20 pounds, without trying from my lack of appetite. I know it's probably not my heart, but I am worried I might have cancer or something else and I know I need to see a doctor, a specialized one and a generalized one, but I can't even step outside without feeling like dying, I have problems even leaving my room.

I'm worried this will either be my life or I'll end up dead without being able to see the future and nobody will have figured out what was wrong with me.

I'm so tired of not being able to enjoy or do anything. I want to be normal again. I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm going to be bedridden forever now, I don't know what I can do."
6,"struggling with cognitive function (concentration, reading, brain fog, memory)","looking for advice/people who have had a similar experience!

so i‚Äôve struggled with anxiety on and off since my teenage years (i‚Äôm 26 right now). before i continue i do want to say that i am on medication and i do see a therapist. i‚Äôve had a really difficult year, last year i really struggled with SH, i was in a mental health clinic for a bit, i moved to a new country, and went through a break up. about 6 weeks ago i started experiencing really intense anxiety that i thought would never end. i was terrified to go to work and see people. the intensity has finally started to decrease and i am able to function fairly well at work. i have also started to unpack why i was so triggered with my therapist and have a fairly good understanding of that. 

however, in the last few weeks my brain has not been functioning properly. i‚Äôm finding it really difficult to concentrate, to retain any information that i watch, read or hear, and my brain is foggy all the time. even just having and following conversations with people or watching series is so difficult. i‚Äôve actually been kind of paranoid that something more than just anxiety is going on. has anyone ever experienced this? if you have experienced this, how did you get out of it? is this a symptom of anxiety?"
7,I'm scared of screwing up on here and being downvoted,"**(tw: abandonment mention; self-criticism)**

I'm scared of saying the wrong thing and upsetting people.  I haven't even been on here for a month, and two of my posts are already more than half-downvoted (I don't vote on my own posts).  The first one was because I asked some admittedly bad questions about why math is even necessary, on r/math no less (almost 80% downvoted).  The second one on r/lgbt (almost 60% downvoted), I'm not sure what happened.  I just asked the community what their LGBT Mario headcanons are and shared a few of my own.

I know people say being downvoted isn't really that big a deal, but it always gives me a sense of ""What did I do?  Was it that bad?  Do I suck as a human being?"" and I can't stop thinking about it for a while.

At least on my r/math post, people explained why they downvoted (and I understand why and just how important math really is!), but no one told me why my r/lgbt post was downvoted.  I always wonder if it should be obvious, but I honestly don't know what I did.

It makes me scared of saying anything at all, no matter how helpful I know it is.  I just want to know what I did and how I can make it up to you.  I hate living in constant fear of saying the wrong thing and having everyone abandon me without explanation.

I know my thoughts are probably incoherent right now.  I'm sorry.

&#x200B;

**EDIT**: As per a comment's request, I'm taking a break from Reddit until I can figure out why I'm so scared of this.  I have therapy on March 5, so I should be back then at the earliest."
8,Feeling bored in moments of relief,"When i occasionally get moments of relief of anxiety, my mind becomes so blank that i just think to myself ""ok, so now what?"". I guess it‚Äôs beacuse i‚Äôm so used to constantly fighting my own thoughts, so that when i don‚Äôt have to i get lowkey bored. I‚Äôm just not used to that much mental space lol."
9,How long did it take for you to start taking medication?,"I mean this in both ways, how long was it you had anxiety for till you thought that you should probably start medication, and then how long did you have your medication sitting there waiting for you to try?

11,"Did anyone of you had parents, who always ""knew better"" and thinks that might be a huge contribution to your anxiety? ","Basically the question above. Parents who basically never allowed you to do anything by yourself, took on all your tasks and decisions bc they thought they knew and could do better than you. I'm just asking myself, if some of my anxiety is learned bc my parents literally told me all the time that I wasn't able enough and they knew better, so they would better do or decide sth for me. "

I'm not sure if this is anxiety or what but I've always said I wish I could just live off of sunlight and water because it overwhelms me to have to figure out meals for myself EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. Now that I live with my partner, I try to figure out dinner for us due to his demanding job and lack of time (I work only part time) and it's making me more stressed! But if I don't figure something out for dinner for us I'm even more anxious because I'm scared he'll be mad.. even after he repeatedly reassures me and offers to pick something up on the way home if I don't have a dinner planned out. I basically just don't eat all day because it stresses me out and then I feel sick. Has anyone else ever felt this way? "

15,Is it normal to argue with myself and have self hate?,"I find myself arguing with myself in my head because of how I think and how I act and how I feel.

I‚Äôm a weirdo and I hate it. Ik it sounds insane but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm crazy, I hope I‚Äôm not. I‚Äôm always worried about what others are thinking and I feel like people are judging me or looking at me. That probably stems from my very low self esteem. But I somehow how still have a little bit of ego. It‚Äôs fucking laughable"
16,Tips for social anxiety while traveling and hiking alone,"Hi all, I‚Äôm traveling internationally to a very friendly country to travel around and go hiking. I can already feel my social anxiety creeping in and looking for advice. 



I have a problem engaging in situations when I don‚Äôt know the ‚Äòprotocol‚Äô or what to expect. It‚Äôs greatly exacerbated when I‚Äôm alone. I feel exposed and like an imposter. At times the feeling is great enough that I‚Äôll back out of whatever I was going to do (get coffee, shop at a store, go on a hike, etc). Sometimes it feels like everything in the world is for everyone else but not for me, especially in a new place. 



On this trip I‚Äôll be staying in a group hut one night on a hiking trail. I‚Äôve never done that before and I‚Äôm petrified. Where‚Äôs the door? How do I find an empty bunk? What if groups of strangers are all hanging out together but I‚Äôm off in the corner like a weirdo? What‚Äôs the etiquette? I‚Äôm already thinking of no cook meals I can bring because I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôll do something ‚Äòwrong‚Äô using the kitchen.



I know I likely won‚Äôt get answers to these specific questions (although if anyone has experience here PLEASE give me any information you can, it helps a lot) but I would love to know how you all overcome being in new spaces alone and stop othering yourself? On this trip I‚Äôd really like to feel like I am allowed to exist in the world.

I searched and people said propranolol will be good, the problem is that I need a prescription but I can't visit a psychiatrist as there's not even one psychiatrist here cause mental health is a taboo in my country. The only pharmacy that I went to said if I show them a photo I took of the medication then they would give it to me, so is there someone here can help me by sending me a pic they took of propranolol ? I really am in a bad state and I can't even skip it cause it's worth 20% of my score. "
20,Experiencing High Anxiety - Feeling Alone.,"Hi all,

Feeling very alone and scared about what I‚Äôm going through. I‚Äôve read through many posts and I know I‚Äôm not the only one experiencing this so hoping this message connects me to others and make me feel a little less helpless.

I‚Äôm 29 (M), I‚Äôve experienced generalised anxiety, health anxiety and panic attacks for most of my 20‚Äôs. 

Generally speaking I‚Äôve been able to take care of myself pretty well through a combination of therapy, meditation, exercise, healthy diet, sleep and other positive tools and strategies.

A couple of weeks ago I started to feel a little unwell at work and took a few days off to recover. During this time I started compulsively checking my pulse, worried that there was something wrong with heart. This eventually escalated into a panic attack where my heart was beating what felt like the fasted and loudest it had ever had.

After trying everything under the sun to calm me down I took the measure of calling emergency where paramedics came to my apartment and did an EKG. Although everything was fine they did ask me to take myself to the hospital for a few further tests just to be safe. So I went to the hospital, had all the tests and was given a total clean bill of health. Nothing wrong with me.

The news that I was healthy definitely helped in the moment and for the next week onwards I was doing everything I could to get back on track and generally speaking made a lot of improvements in that short time.

A couple of days ago however my firm announced a large scale layoff. Fortunately I was unaffected, yet I feel like I‚Äôve totally fallen into an anxiety spiral.

Sleep has been poor, appetite is very low, lots of symptoms, racing heart, sweating, tightness in my chest and hot and cold sensations.

Although I‚Äôve been here before I am just really scared. Scared that these symptoms will kill me, scared that this will impact my relationship, scared it will change the way my friends and colleagues perceive of me, scared that I won‚Äôt come out of it. 

Thanks for listening ‚ù§Ô∏è

21,I cry when a teacher is slightly mad,"So I'm in high school and I've never gotten in trouble, and i get really good grades. I've never missed homework. But the other day I got to science and I had lost my homework sheet. I told the teacher and she said I'd get an incomplete (a thing you get for missing homework, three of them is meant to equal a detention but its not enforced) Now this shouldn't be a big deal, most people just take it and move on, but apparently not me. My eyes started welling up and i was desperately trying not to cry. my teacher noticed and asked me to step outside. She asked if I was ok, and said i could do extra work instead and i gladly excepted. The only other time a teacher has been slightly mad at me, I didn't know the deadline for a big project was in a week and my English teacher said he'd said it enough times, I should have known. Again I started crying and he came over at the end of class. I physically cannot stop myself from crying when a teacher is slightly, mildly disappointed or mad or I did something wrong. Is something wrong with me? sorry for the long post"
22,Not schizo but something else. ,"I‚Äôm not sure what ‚Äúsymptom‚Äù of anxiety this could be, I hear/strongly imagine people‚Äôs conversations about me. And they‚Äôre never good.  Was wondering if this happens for other anxiety-havers. Or advice/tips?

For example, when I was in my freshman year of highschool I ‚Äúimagined‚Äù my boyfriends ex girlfriend & her friend talk mostly bad things about me.  And I know logically that they‚Äôre not physically talking about me, at least, not in that actual moment. But it still *feels* like they were talking bad about me. Like I would think about them randomly in class or when I was in class with them I always felt very anxious around them because I felt like they were talking about me. 

Thankfully I‚Äôm not in school with them anymore so I don‚Äôt have that dreadful terrible imagining of them talking shit about me. 

But right now I am experiencing a very similar thing. Everytime I think of my ex boyfriend (which is pretty pretty often because we broke up not too long ago & he was emotionally abusive) i STRONGLY imagine and feel like he is saying BAD BAD things about me. Embarrassing things. Mostly because irl I hooked up with a lot of people he knows (years before we started dating) so it gives him ‚Äúfuel‚Äù  in a way to call me all sorts of things. 

Even if he WAS talking shit with his friends about me, logically I know I shouldn‚Äôt rlly care because I‚Äôm probably never going to see him or his friends again, nor should I care about what they have to say about me. 

But I just feel so ashamed all the time hearing him and his friends conversations about me. Not forgetting to mention my body FEELS and almost hopes to see him again, at a red light. At a club. At the store. I know logically I should not want that to happen.

I‚Äôm wondering if anyone has advice, or can relate to this sort of ‚ÄúI feel like people are talking about me‚Äù anxiety/paranoia. If you read this far, thank you so much. Sorry for the length. "

24,Family member invalidating my condition.,"Hello, I hope you will take the time to read through my post, thank you in advance.

In the last two months I have had way more anxiety and panic attacks than I have had in years. Although I did go through a lot of them, as well as a bunch of other symptoms 7-ish years ago. Even then, my mother has been invalidating how I feel, so I had to suffer for years in silence and daily panic attacks, followed by soo many other mental and physical symptoms. I didn't have any other ways or means to treat it, and back then I didn't even know what a panic attack was, so I wasn't even able to google things or wasn't aware of ANY of what was going on. I was stuck in that for years and years until anxiety slowly tappered off, and I was mostly back to my normal life.

Well.

As I have said in recent times It's back and worse than ever. I have started developing fears I never had before, have symptoms that legitimately make me feel like I am dying and I have INSANE pain and headaches that make it feel like my head will just pop open any second. It's all so scary and exhausting. My sleep is poor, I have lost about 5 kg in the last 2 weeks alone, even though I am eating the same. I have almost daily headaches and panic attacks WITHOUT even thinking about my fears. Yes, during the first week or two I have been thinking about things going wrong all the time, but now since my body is so sensitive I am still getting headaches and panic attacks without even consciously feeding into my anxiety. I am even making sure that I don't avoid anything, since I know avoidance is bad. So I have done everything I have so far, just 10 times harder with anxiety.

Overall, It's BAD. At least that's how I feel about it.

Now, my mother is yet again a complete asshole towards me in these scenarios. I have had the worst headache/panic attack of my entire life recently (and let me tell you I have had a lot of them), and I called her to come over and call an ambulance, and she just said: well It makes sense when your life is such a mess (It's not) and you're not listening to me. She has this obsession with trying to control my life, and basically made me believe all of my failures and decisions are awful and she is my savior and God. So she now even blames me being in deliberating pain on, well, myself. As If my childhood wasn't a clusterfuck and as If, as you can see, her attitude and literal 0 empathy didn't help in my upbringing and the rise of a lot of my mental health ailments.

I guess I am just looking for some compassion here. It's so hard because I feel like I am legit alone. I know she wouldn't even drive me to the hospital If I was complaining or was in pain. She just plainly doesn't care. She's like: you won't listen to me? Well alright, die alone in your misery.

I am still gonna be fighting the anxiety and will strive to get better, I won't let her attitude stop me, but It's just very very very frustrating and disappointing still. The worst of it all is that I live alone with her too. And my dad, who is actually a nice person, lives in another city (living with him isn't an option)..."
25,I noticed a pattern,"

Hey All
So I noticed a pattern last night with my anxiety... took long enough...
I've known I've had a Health Anxiety for awhile now caused by the loss of a parent and the years they were terminal. She had a very pragmatic way of looking at it. All logic and planning and no open emotion.

I've had a few issues with my blood pressure recent, on medication to sort it and generally feeling better and on a successful health kick.
But I notice that whenever I get a twinge or anything in my chest. That's it. I'm disappearing down a internal rabbit hole. My mind will then delve into what would happen if I died tonight? what if I keeled over here? Would my children find me? What would my loved ones think? 

I never thought I had ""negative thinking"" and I suspect its because its been hidden as pragmatic and planning. Its not. Its negitive and its spirals me. 
So I'm hoping other people will be able to help me at this point. I've recognised the trigger which is self perpetuating.

How do I interupt that?"

Does this happen to anyone else?
28,Grief & Anxiety,"Has anyone developed intense anxiety after losing a loved one?

For context I‚Äôm 29 and my mom passed away due to cancer August 2023. For months I could cry and let out my emotions and it always felt very cathartic like I really needed to let it out. As of January I can‚Äôt really cry, I‚Äôm EXTREMELY anxious and having panic attacks and depersonalization/derealization moments. I did recently start going to therapy and going to the gym and I‚Äôm hoping that may help. But I‚Äôm just feeling so frustrated and trapped? If that makes sense. I just feel like I need to release these emotions. 

My next step is seeing a psychiatrist and maybe get on meds because idk what to do. :( It‚Äôs really affecting my day to day life.

Some main things I have noticed include: random moments of panic where i convince myself that my heart will stop, panic where i remember where I am and what i‚Äôm doing, difficulty breathing, feeling like i am falling, and panic when a consistent noise stops (i use a computer in my exams, so for example when everyone was to stop typing at once creating a quieter sound, that causes extreme panic).

Of course these are mocks so it doesn‚Äôt matter too much in regards to my overall performance. However this is worrying to me as my exams are not too far away (mid May).

Any advice would be very helpful. Also, I don‚Äôt think i can get a doctors help with medication as i am 17yrs and don‚Äôt turn 18 until some weeks after my exam. "
33,"horrible panic attacks, dont know what to do","hi all im on here to maybe get an answer to why this is happening. i used to be a daily smoker but had to quit for about 6 months due to legal issues. i smoked for my first time in months a couple weeks ago and thought i had laced weed, was having a heart attack, ir a seizure. i had the symptoms of hallucinations, tunnel vision, extreme sweating and movement, heart racing etc. ive since came to the conclusion that this was an intense panic attack. ive smoked 4 times since then in very very small amounts and every time i have had a panic attack. i have had anxiety for a while along with depersonalization depression and adhd but i‚Äôve learned to deal with these symptoms over time. ever since the first panic attack i have been anxious to the point its hard to function doing daily tasks. ive had a couple sober too due to the anxiety but they are a lot easier to control than when high. im really scared of what this could turn into and also getting extremely drained from these feelings.


 i used to be able to use cannabis to get away from anxiety and now i cant use it without having a panic attack.

if anyone could give me some advice or answers itd be very appreciated."

35,Experience doesn't seem to have any impact,"A few years ago I started a list of all the things that gave me anxiety at work and started working/tracking those. They've all been resolved but the list has never stopped. Years later I'm still adding new things there sporadically. 

I've learned nothing about the list even though it's clear evidence that most things work out in the end. It's there in black and white but my mind keeps dismissing it and saying that the major catastrophe is just around the corner."

37,"Scared for my husband's anxiety, chest muscle spams becoming more frequent.","Hi everyone! I know there's a million posts here who relate anxiety to trembling/spams and as someone who has anxiety issues myself, I know this can be normal but I really wanted to lay out his situation in case this is something I could do more of something to help...

I'll try to keep it short. My husband is 34 and has struggled with anxiety in the past. He is always super muscle tensed up, because of anxiety and is definitely an over thinker and worries too much...

 However, he wasn't used to having actual panic attacks and had his first one last month after taking a 5-HTP supplement. He went to bed to then start to feel anxiety rise on his chest, rapid heartbeat, couldn't calm down and started to overall strongly shake. It eventually went away.

However, he experienced it again last week, also after experimenting a new supplement, tryptophan this time. The attack was stronger this time around and we had to go outside and walk to calm him down. His chest was spasming uncontrollably. 
He was left a bit ""traumatized"" after this and now lives in fear that that kind of attack will come back every day. 

He will feel his anxiety daily, rise at certain occasions for no reason, he feels when he's doing worse and meditates and journals to get it down again, or tries to distract himself but now I know that he's having these new symptoms at the back of his mind all day.

Yesterday, it happened again when we went to bed. He got up to pee, felt anxiety rise in chest, tried to calm down but couldn't so his chest started to shake. I know fear of these attacks doesn't help but there might be a pattern here that I'm not seeing?

It always happens when he lays down to bed, which makes me wonder if it has anything to do with his constant muscle tension.
I also considered association mentally because he had his first one in bed after taking the supplement the first time. He has previously struggled with anxiety being in restaurants after he had a mild panic attack during a dinner out and then couldn't step foot in a restaurant for months, which he has recovered from..
I wonder all this and if his mind somehow makes connections with the conditions he's in. Tell me if this sounds plausible..

I'm questioning if he should see a psychiatrist, as he has seen two therapists before but none of them helped...

He is great at regulating his anxiety, he'll go for runs and do breath work and meditate but then it comes back up again and he's been anxious about the future...
If anyone has any insight on what this could be, what kind of reaction this could be due to, so I can ease his mind and reassure him...

He's convinced he has something serious like epilepsy, or a major hidden problem and I just want to share others experiences with him and help..
Thank you for reading."
38,Health anxiety,"Hi, i just joined and i wanted to share my expirience and what i'm dealing with in this moment with the hope that someone will relate to this. I've suffered from health anxiety for about almost 10 months now, it all started when my dog died.I've never been concerned about my health and i've never had any health issue before. I started googling things i used to think because they were kind of odd for me like "" is it normal to make fake scenarios in your head"" and so on. Then i found that that was a mental issue and started worrying , but its not the only case. For the first part of this ""journey"" i was scared of mental condition like schizofrenia, ocd, psychosis etcetera. Then I started focusing on physical condition, i've had obsessive thoughts about heart attack , ictus , aneurysm , and anxiety was making me having every symptom, the more i searched the more i was feeling those sensation in my body.

After 5-6 months of constant anxiety 24/7 It felt like it was finally over , but it wasn't. I started to get anxiety every other day. There were ""and still are"" 2 or 3 days where anxiety was at its lowest point i could barely feel it , and others where it was at some level that i've never expirienced before , it actually felt like i was going crazy.

Right now what i constantly think about is ""Do I have tourette"" because i've always had nervous tic but with anxiety they really disturb me , maybe because i keep thinking about it . I'm not saying they are intense, i feel the need to do it , it's not in an involutary way i know i'm doing that.

Sorry for the long post. I never found someone who talk about health anxiety with mental conditions fears.

39,Overthinking texts,"I‚Äôm not sure if this is the right subreddit for this but I‚Äôm constantly over analyzing my texts, deleting and retyping over and over.

For example, I just had an exchange with someone where they said something along the lines of ‚Äúit‚Äôs actually really funny because‚Ä¶ *then asks unrelated question*‚Äù and I responded with ‚Äúthat is funny. *then I answer question*‚Äù

I keep rereading my ‚Äúthat is funny.‚Äù and it‚Äôs eating at me that I didn‚Äôt say ‚Äúhaha no way, that is funny.‚Äù instead because it sounds so much more natural and less like a bot.

45,Does my relative have anxiety or something else?,"Hi all, I‚Äôm wondering if a close relative of mine might have more anxiety than usual? They constantly seem to worry about others‚Äô welfare more than their own. If their adult children are out late, they worry and have to call (I mean, adult children, which is a bit extreme to me). They can never get a good night‚Äôs rest‚Äîlucky to get five every night. They cannot sit still for long and get restless and don‚Äôt do well with crowds. 

They seem to text a lot if they don‚Äôt hear from you and worry if they don‚Äôt hear from you for long. They talk about death a lot in the sense of people they knew have died all the time and they talk about funerals as well or say I‚Äôm attending so and so‚Äôs funeral. They talk a lot about people that lived but have passed on. They don‚Äôt get out much or meet new people besides the circle of friends and family they have. Sometimes they seem on edge and restless and can‚Äôt seem to sit down and enjoy the moment at times. They constantly have to be busy I think. 

I mean, does this sound like GAD? ADHD? Just a plain worry-wart?"
46,Is it normal to feel itching underneath the nails?,"I feel this since I was a child. Mostly at night, and when I‚Äôm anxious, I feel the underside of my nails itch?

To make it feel better I usually, like, slide the seam part of shirts on the space between my nails and skin, I don‚Äôt really know how to explain it. It started suddenly as a child, and I also had a thing I used to do with my tongue that I don‚Äôt know how to explain, but I forced myself to stop when I got into my teenage years, but I still feel it.

Nowadays I associate that to my anxiety, but I never really talked about it with other people.

Today I have lost my grandfather. Again, in a chaotic moment of my life. I have moved to another country and I am attending to college. Everything was so stressful during the move in that games became my escapism. Now that he is dead, all I want is my escapism (games) and to focus on college. So I am left with that guilt again. He was an important person for my family, especially my father. My appreciation of him came from the stories my father told me about their life together. So not acknowledging his death and life leaves me with anxiety.

54,I am afraid that my landlord doesn't think I am trying to work off my rent.,"I haven't been able to get a job this past month which obviously resulted in me not being able to pay my bills. My biggest concern was my rent so I was completely honest with my landlord. He was unsure to allow me to stay since I didn't have a job lined up so there was no certainty I was going to get money especially on short notice. So, he is allowing me to work off my rent. But was very clear that if I didn't show up that I would be evicted. So far now it is just cleaning out/around the apartment units. 

First day went pretty well. The maintenance guy gave me compliments for the work I did by myself. However the second day was shorter. I had a doctors appointments which made me only work a few hours. The guy who is supervising(same maintenance dude) me was nice about it let me go to it. And told me to be ready again same time tomorrow. But after my appointment, I finally got calls back from the jobs I applied to and was able to setup two interviews tomorrow. 

I really need to go to these interviews so I can finally get some money flowing. However, I don't want to cut my day short again and for the landlord to think that I am not trying to work off my rent. I do also understand that they would also think that I too need a job so I can my bill including rent. But I feel like it isn't a good look when two of my first three days have been short hours."

57,Rare disease and anxiety,"Hi guys, I don‚Äôt really know how to word this. This is my first post and I guess I just wanted to be heard about this issue. 

My whole life I have suffered from anxiety. My earliest childhood memory was a panic attack. I used to pass out during middle school social interactions and into high school I was heavily introverted. I always assumed I was anxious because of the sexual trauma that occurred when I was a child so I just dealt with it. It got a bit better, but throughout my whole life I was always anxious and sick. I would get muscle spasms and I would get randomly numb. Some days I would just almost pass out, but rescue myself with a banana. I grew up with a bipolar mom (undiagnosed) that never believed in mental illnesses and that I was just weak in the mind. So, I did what all young unheard kids do and just kept it inside. 

Now, I‚Äôm in my mid twenties and back home after escaping. I‚Äôve been to the hospital 5 times within the last 4 months. After 7 doctors telling me it‚Äôs just my anxiety and overworking myself. I am now told‚Ä¶ I have a 1 in 400,000 rare genetic kidney disease. Literally today. Also, I might of had it when I was a baby. Also also, it could be contributing to my anxiety and I could‚Äôve died multiple times. 

I don‚Äôt know how to process anything. My anxiety is so fragile right now. I don‚Äôt know if anyone else with rare diseases or just any know that same feeling. Bouncing with anxiety their whole life only to be told it was their body telling them something is wrong.
 I am spiraling and I don‚Äôt know how to make my mind stop. How do you keep yourself together when you find out you have lived your whole life with an unknown disease? I keep triggering myself and then it triggers my disease that sends my body out of whack. 
I have a therapist, but I guess I just want to know I am not alone in this. Because this is terrifying. I feel like I‚Äôve lost the little freedom I have left and it‚Äôs to my own body.

62,Should I give myself time and quit my job until I get professional help or do I keep pushing myself through the anxiety,"I have struggled with anxiety since I can remember.

If I'm driving, leaving work, working, exercising, even showering... my anxiety is always there. Im scripted Xanax so I take it daily but it's such a downer because I don't want to take it everyday. (its more for an emergency). I've been trying CBD & it works but it's not something I want to rely on for the rest of my life. My primary care physician will NOT prescribe me a daily medication for this either. The CBD thankfully takes away the heart palpitations & the fear in my head but this GAD & panic disorder is eating at me, every single day. 

I just got blood work done & my labs came back all perfectly fine - I'm in great health but I tend to worry if I have something else going on with me. It's such a mind kill???

How do you all get by? "
65,I think I may be having anxiety attacks ,"Idk where to start with this, so I‚Äôll start with some stuff that caused me to not consider anxiety being the source for a while. 

I‚Äôm very light. And because I‚Äôm very light, I think I‚Äôm more vulnerable to things like passing out and feeling dizzy, so it‚Äôs important for me to eat frequently. 

When I was 14, I passed out in class because I skipped breakfast. I‚Äôll never forget that awful, awful dizziness, and the worst was the nausea. I have awful emetophobia‚Äî diagnosed. 

Lately, I‚Äôll get these small waves of nausea accompanied by feelings of dread and anxiety. It makes my heart palpitate, and the longer it goes on for, the more lightheaded and shaky I get. Even typing about it brings back the feeling a bit. 

The reason why I‚Äôm starting to think they‚Äôre anxiety attacks, and not due to me not eating enough (because I‚Äôve been eating plenty), is that when I start feeling it, I worry about the nausea. ‚ÄúWhat if I can‚Äôt hold it back this time?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat if I throw up?‚Äù And the waves of nausea and uneasiness continue. 

It‚Äôs really hard to control. I try thinking about random things, daydreaming, breathing exercises, listening to music, but then that stupid thought just weasels its way back into my head and the horrible feeling continues. 

Fortunately, I‚Äôm incredibly stubborn and will go to insane measures to make sure I don‚Äôt actually throw up or anything and haven‚Äôt so far, but it‚Äôs really uncomfortable and always ends in tears (initially fear and then relief when it‚Äôs over) 

I don‚Äôt know what to do about this. I have a therapist, but I would like a lot of advice at once so I have ideas, because this is terrifying. I‚Äôd also like to know if this sounds like an anxiety attack. 

So again, it‚Äôll start with heart palpitations, then waves of anxiety and dread that are accompanied by nausea, and the longer it goes on, the more likely I am to end it trembling and weak feeling all over. If it happens at night, sometimes I‚Äôll still feel weak and shaky the next morning "

After a call with my Gf this morning I felt anxious again but I took a 20 min nap and felt like I had no problem in the world? Like I wasn‚Äôt in danger for once. Has anyone ever felt this? My GAD keeps scaring me that it‚Äôs terminal lucidity because that tends to happen to people who are dying but I keep telling myself that it isn‚Äôt that. Can anyone relate?
67,Any jobs I can get?,"For context I'm 18 year old male who dropped out of high school 2 months into 10th grade. I have no GED or diploma and no car. I have severe social anxiety that's so bad I can't even look family members in the eyes anymore. And I have 0 job experience.

Preferably I would get an online job since even if it only pays like 15k a year or something I can at least do it and get some experience and money for the future. I just need something to earn me money even if it's not the most fun or best job. So long as I can do it with what I said in the first paragraph then I'll do it."
68,Positive experiences with Paxil?,I kind of already know since I was on it 10 years ago but it's just been so long I feel like I forgot. My psychiatrist wants me on it again and I just took my first dose 30 min ago. Did it help ya'll? Short term? Long term? Right now I mostly feel calm like my anxiety and feelings are there but far away if that makes sense. My thoughts feel slower too. 
69,Hyper Aware Of Breathing (Anxiety),"For the last 3 months of been solely focused on my breathing. Like manually all day long, and it‚Äôs robbing me of doing the things I used to. I don‚Äôt want to leave my room, and it‚Äôs taking a tole on my mental. I just got some anxiety medicine today, and some for sleep. I just want to feel okay again. I can‚Äôt stop focusing on it all day long, it feels like I‚Äôm just going to stop and that I‚Äôm not getting enough breath. I‚Äôm hoping the meds help to calm me down and stop obsessing over my breathing all the time. Any tips? Or has anyone else experienced this? "
70,Anxiety/OCD/depression,"As I decided to sit here and finally write something I look back at my life over these last couple of months. I have been struggling so badly and been reaching out to Reddit in order to make me feel some comfort. We often feel so alone and isolated when going through these hard times. People look at us like we are crazy if they‚Äôve never dealt with an anxiety disorder, OCD, or depression. As I go through this terribly hard time in my life, I‚Äôm here to remind all of you, if you are dealing with this, we will get through it. 

The debilitating thoughts and feelings will fade. I come on Reddit to explore other people like me because like I said sometimes I feel so alone and feel like I am going crazy. Being at the doctors, hospitals numerous times. Getting answers like ‚Äúyou look great, go home it‚Äôs anxiety.‚Äù But for some reason it‚Äôs not enough reassurance.. you are still searching for what could possibly be wrong with you.. You forget how to trust your body and you let your brain take hold. I NEVER wanted to become a part of anxiety and in these past few months, anxiety has become me.. it‚Äôs no longer just a part, it‚Äôs all of me. I‚Äôm here to get out of this, I want to have a place where people can come and feel safe and just talk. I want us to all feel like we belong and just because we don‚Äôt feel ‚Äúnormal‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean we won‚Äôt ever feel normal again. Don‚Äôt set a time for yourself to ‚Äúfeel better.‚Äù Give yourself and your body time.. sit in your anxious thoughts.. do what you need to do to get better even though it seems so difficult right now. 

I have had so many physical symptoms in the last months and each week they seem to change after I have just gotten over the last one. From headaches to twitches.. I mean literally EVERYTHING. I want this to be a place where people can come and post their symptoms or just talk about how they are feeling today.. it‚Äôs so nice to have people to relate to even if it‚Äôs not something fun to deal with. I write this with ALL of the love in the world. For each and every person going through this.. I want you to know we are going to get through this together.. anxiety will always be there but that‚Äôs ok.. I hope everyone can find their happiness and maybe help me find a little bit of mine again ü´∂üèΩ"
71,terrified that i have lung cancer,"Hello, so i'm dealing with extreme anxiety that i may have developed lung cancer, i'm a former daily weed smoker of 7 years (2 joints a day), and have smoked cigarettes daily (2-6 Cigs a day) for about a year. I stopped smoking weed for about 3 months now and am trying to stop cigarettes, i still feel like my lungs are congested. I may simply not remember what a non smokers lungs feel like anymore as well. I also get an occasional slight burning sensation within my right lung thats very feint and doesn't really hurt, I had a Chest X-ray done at an urgent care and I was told everything looked normal and because Im young (25 year old) my risk of cancer isn't really a concern. However from my research i'm told that X-rays aren't as accurate for detecting early cancer, I had an MRI and a CT scan set up to calm my anxiety, however both are coming out to be around $3000 and insurance wont cover it. Should I simply calm my anxiety and get the scans or am i being paranoid? also does anyone know any confirmed methods to clean out ones lungs other than simply time?"

73,What medications can I get that actually work,I‚Äôm 18 years old and female. I have suffered with social anxiety severely since I was 13. I‚Äôve tried 3 therapists which haven‚Äôt really helped much. Im unable to work as I can‚Äôt overcome the anxiety. I was recommended beta blockers to reduce heart rate however my issue isn‚Äôt physical symptoms my brain physically cannot get over the feelings of fear and the dread I feel whenever I have to do something simple such as going to a till to pay. Is there any medications that affect the brains way of thinking instead of controlling the physical symptoms? If anyone has tried anything please tell me how it affects you and how much you would recommend it 
74,the fear of heart attack is getting bad,"i‚Äôm to blame no one but myself for this, because i live a very unhealthy life. i drink energy drinks and soda every day, i eat unhealthily and don‚Äôt exercise often. i‚Äôm underweight and have been told that i need to gain weight, and i take that as an excuse to eat a lot and unhealthy food and not exercise. i want to change this, but i‚Äôm a 17 year old student living alone and i work at mcdonald‚Äôs, i genuinely can‚Äôt afford to eat healthy all the time. i‚Äôve been having chest pains for a few weeks now. not bad pains, more like dull pains. i‚Äôve been feeling nauseous and have been having trouble eating. today i started trembling and my anxiety went sky high. i also ran to catch the bus and got heart palpitations. i don‚Äôt know if this is anxiety or if something is actually wrong. should i see the nurse at my school for this or am i making too big of a deal out of nothing?"
75,I Regret Getting an Echocardiogram,"TW Cardiophobia

I had an echocardiogram recently and was told I was completely healthy, but I have trace regurgitation. My doctor said it isn‚Äôt worrisome, but that didn‚Äôt make me feel better. She didn‚Äôt mention that they found ‚Äúmild systolic anterior motion of the mitral chordal apparatus‚Äù. I don‚Äôt know what that means and there aren‚Äôt many studies on this, but I found some scholarly articles that had some devastating results. I left her a message to explain it better, but it has my anxiety so elevated waiting for her to respond. 

 I have been suffering with some serious health anxiety due to some chest pain I‚Äôve been having. Anxiety has caused some physical symptoms like tension headaches, heart palpitations, air hunger, racing heart, chest pain, etc. These have all triggered really awful panic attacks where I feel like I‚Äôm having a heart attack or dying which have sent me to the ER twice. Both times I was told I was perfectly fine and healthy even though I had a scare that I might have a pulmonary embolism but it was negative. I was pretty active where I went to the gym 5 times a week and I ate really healthy before this. I had little stress too. I have always been an anxious person though but it was very manageable.

These symptoms manifested during a stressful time where I was in the middle of moving cross country and losing my job. I figured it was anxiety, but it chose to manifest as health anxiety. It has been tough to manage. I stopped working out over 3 months ago due to fear of something bad happening to me. Now, I feel paralyzed. I‚Äôm afraid that I‚Äôm going to drop dead. There are no known heart issues in my family. I‚Äôm trying to live with this new knowledge, but my anxiety has been worse now. I was feeling better and extremely positive until these results. Now I‚Äôm back to the same symptoms I had in past and I‚Äôm even more afraid for my heart. 

I could‚Äôve chosen to live without this knowledge, but my anxiety made me want to get reassurance which I understand now that‚Äôs not always a good thing.

I don‚Äôt know what to do right now. I just want to feel better. "
76,How do I drink with my anxiety,I can‚Äôt drink anymore I used to be the biggest drinker getting fucked up for years I was basically an alcoholic and I crave it all the time but now anytime I drink I get severe anxiety and it just makes me feel terrible. I hate it it used to be a way for me to let go and now I have nothing to let go with. I‚Äôm so pissed and angry and feel helpless to this damn mental illness I‚Äôm facing. Has anyone dealt with this and how did you guys get over it? I wanna drink again so bad I tried to have a sip of a drink and it just made me feel bad. I hate this so much it makes me wish I could go back in time like crazy. 
77,Propranolol is working GREAT until it wears off?,"My doctor prescribed me propranolol to help with my anxiety symptoms. I‚Äôve been taking the extended release pill for a few days, and during the day it‚Äôs been helping manage the ‚Äúpanic‚Äù feelings that come with my daily anxieties. I take it in the AM around 6:00 before I leave for work.

However, I‚Äôve noticed that later in the evening anywhere from 5-7pm I start to feel those anxiety feelings again, but they feel magnified (like they make up for the rest of the day almost). I also get incredibly irritated and have that blind ‚Äúrage‚Äù feeling at small annoyances. 

Has anyone experienced this? Does this mean the med isn‚Äôt a good fit for me?"

80,Change myself or just my environment? ,"Work, school, and social situations have always made me anxious, to the point where it‚Äôs almost unbearable. I‚Äôve always just forced myself to do things despite the anxiety and found unhealthy coping mechanisms to deal with it and expected it to get better eventually, But now, it‚Äôs getting to the point where I‚Äôm considering switching careers completely since I‚Äôm so miserable all the time.

How can I try to figure out if I need to change my career/social events I participate in/lifestyle in general, or if it‚Äôs just my anxiety and it‚Äôll follow me wherever I go? I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôm letting my anxiety win if I switch paths - but maybe I just genuinely don‚Äôt like what I‚Äôm doing. I just can‚Äôt tell which it is, which is the underlying problem, and I don‚Äôt know how to separate them out.

81,Started having severe 'physical' anxiety attacks after COVID- ways to cope so I can get my independence back?,"Hello everyone! TW for medical anxiety/COVID/medical trauma/being physically sick below.

I was COVID positive for 4 weeks and have just come out the other side of 6wks post viral syndrome. I'm still not 'back to normal' per se, but I'm pretty functional most of the time which I'm very thankful for!

Unfortunately however I'm still dealing with heightened anxiety post-covid, and I've identified being left alone/going outside alone as a specific trigger for these intense, body-based panic attacks I've never previously had before that are preventing me from physically going to class or to work.

Basically, I feel entirely normal when I'm at home or if I'm outside the house with my partner or my parents, but the *second* I'm not with her or my family I become extremely anxious/panicked. I freeze up entirely and I feel like I'm going to both faint and throw up and my hands and face start tingling/go numb. I'm not really thinking 'anxious thoughts' in the lead up to the attack at all - in fact I can barely feel them coming at all, it's almost an instant fight-or-flight reaction.

My best guess here is that my body so strongly fears being sick or in pain while I'm by myself that I end up causing myself to be sick from anxiety/panic. There was at least one incident when I was COVID-positive where I fainted and hurt myself when nobody was home, and I do feel like my mental health hasn't been the same since that specific incident. So rather than a generalized anxiety or attachment issue, I think these attacks are like a trauma response? I'm not sure though.

I've been trying really hard to push through the attacks, doing 'exposure therapy' when I can (going for walks by myself, spending manageable amounts of time without company, doing 'normal' activities like light exercise to show my body I'm healthy and don't have to fear being sick, etc). That stuff has been helping me build up my resilience again, but coping in the moment is still a struggle for me right now. Breathing techniques and grounding helps but not enough to fully stop attacks once they're happening. The only thing that fully stops attacks atm is removing the trigger, ie going home or calling my gf/parents to come get me. Otherwise I just have to fully disassociate until I'm no longer in a triggering situation :')

Obviously it's pretty frustrating because I can't have someone supervising me 24/7. I'm 24 years old and was doing really great before I got sick, so I miss being independent a lot.

I'm not sure what else I can do to help myself other than what I've been doing, but I also *don't know what I'm doing* and thought it was worth asking if there are any techniques or other things I can try.

I've considered talking to my GP/going to see a medical professional, but I don't know if this is something that talk therapy or counseling could help with, & and I really don't want to have to take anxiety meds (just watched my mum come off those and she had horrendous side effects). That being said, I'm just feeling pretty lost & confused in general and if I have to take things to make the anxiety stop I'll definitely consider it."

83,convinced that people dislike me,"i am currently in my first year of uni and my anxiety has been at its peak lately. my biggest problem is the fact that im constantly under the impression that everyone i interact with dislikes me and only spends time with me because they feel sorry for me. ive dealt with these feelings for years, but recently theyve been even stronger, possibly due to the change in environment that i still havent gotten used to. i personally think that i tend to feel this way about myself because i was kind of the 'weird kid' in middle school and constantly got sort of bullied and excluded out of things. how can i tell whether my worries about people only spending time with me to be nice are true or not (without asking the people directly obviously)? there are people in my life that invite me to hang out, send me things on social media and generally seem pleased when they see me, but my brain just keeps telling me that they feel sorry for me or just want to be nice and will leave me eventually because im a burden to them. thank you for your advice in advance, its just been hard lately. i never used to think of myself as someone who struggles with self hatred, but recently ive realized that these feelings are apparently not a normal thing to have lol"

86,Physical symptoms of anxiety,"
Been trialing low dose diazepam, and I am happy with how it makes me feel. It‚Äôs not a big obvious change but I know it relaxes me in a way. I can‚Äôt quite describe it. I don‚Äôt lose myself or anything. 

I take it conditionally, as in, when I feel I need to before a certain situation or event. 

What I am noticing tho is the intensity of my physical anxiety symptoms when I don‚Äôt take it. 

Has anyone changed from benzos to something else you take daily that gives you the same relaxed feeling? 

I still feel anxious but the intensity isn‚Äôt the same on diazepam "

Partly anxious due to other work related things rejecting me, one was a volunteer position and no one cared that I left or wanted me to be there, and criticised a mistake I made despite being a mental health charity, the other was an apprenticeship opportunity where i was rejected for mental health reasons."

93,Just my story.,"Figured, I'm struggling at the moment and would share my story, maybe it will help... Maybe it will depress people. Who knows.

I was in the 4th grade when I was diagnosed with ADHD, was on Adderall for may years, all through elementary and middle school. Once i began high school however i stopped as it wasn't as effective for me. I manged through high school fairly well. No real signs on anxiety. A few bouts of depression and feeling crappy, but that's normal in that part of life. I continued on, no problems. Occasionally feeling ""sick"" an ""uncomfortable"". I graduated and went to a vocational school. Studied massage therapy and had a wonderful time exploring holistic health and wellness, daily massages and wonderful teachers and classmates. I felt immensely supported and well liked. However after that graduation I did what anyone in that position would do, looked for work. I was let down by many places and work environments. The first was run by a coke fiend who had no clue how to run a spa and i soon left. I found another place that worked for as long as they needed me, hiring me under the lie i would be a permanent employee but was 6 weeks for another workers  maternity leave. I also struggled working in salon environment of ""mean girls"" as they all talked shit and tried to include me and pull me down with them. 

at 22 around 2012 i began to struggle, I started having anxiety, panic issues. It started in November at my sisters birthday dinner. We as a family were out at a restaurant and shortly through the meal, I had checked out and began to panic. I was so uncomfortable. I left and went to sit in the car. I cooled off but wanted nothing more than to go home. Once home, i was fine. But it began a horrible mess in my life. I began to panic more routinely, even simply going to a store i had been to a thousand times. target, grocery store, whatever. I couldn't do it. I talked to my doctor, she prescribed me Paxil (paroxetine) 20mg, and a temporary xanax as needed. I was doing ok on it, but through December i really struggled to just exist. That first hardcore panic attack was awful . I remember it vividly, I sat in the living room eating an apple. 3 bites in, I began to feel ill, I ran to the bathroom to vomit. Immediately the sweating, the unease, the breathlessness, the racing heart. All of it. I found myself flat on the floor calling my mom into the bathroom begging her to take me to the ER. She was wise enough to tell me "" its most likely a panic attack"" she suggested i take a xanax and I did, 20 minutes in I started to feel calm. It was a panic attack. Problem was, that's when it all went downhill. Soon after i was unable to go anywhere. I talked to my doctor again and she bumped me up from 20mg to 40mg of paxil and added a booster of wellbutrin(Buproprion) 150mg and I began to feel myself again. I started doing more and really living again. I got a solid job again working for another company that had contracts all over Minnesota working with athlete and in hotels doing massage, I was happy. in 2016, I met a man who would change my life, my now boyfriend of 8 years. I was hesitant, but dating and falling in love was damn easy. Things were going amazingly. I didn't struggle at all. Everything was so smooth. I was happy, engaging in life and all around feeling great. I manged to travel to the northern part of Minnesota to enjoy a lot with my partner. Going to Milwaukee for a show. Then to Las Vegas for my first flight and vacation without my family. Then again in the spring to a friends wedding in Georgia. It was so fun and amazing. I loved every minute with my partner and friends. My boyfriend and I had move in together into a wonderful apartment and soon adopted an adorable cat. Love was everywhere. Despite me leaving my old job because the hours were sparse and overhead was lacking. things where good. 

2020, my dirty 30. I was already struggling small things were starting to affect me. My partner planned a wonderful surprise birthday party with tons of friends an family and everyone had a blast. This was in June. Sadly things began to dwindle an affect me, COVID 19 and the fear surrounding everything. My mental health was in the shitter. I felt as though my meds were less and less effective. I started having worse and worse anxiety and panic attacks. I could barely function. Ever day was more and more a struggle, not only with my inability to leave the apartment but the ideas of keeping my relationship afloat, getting work in a time when everyone was unable to work anyway. It fucked me. 5 months, 5 months of being unable to leave my home, crying often, panicking daily. It was taking a had tole. I again contacted mt doctor, She suggested keeping on the wellbutrin, and started me on 20mg of lexapro. It never felt as right as the paxil. But it did something. I needed to start leaving again. Getting in the car even on 1mg of Ativan would cause panic. driving around the parking lot on 1mg of ativan would still upset me. But little by little, short trips and determination I began to leave and get going. Over the course of many months i was back to somewhat normal. 1 mg a day for going out. As i became more comfortable, i lessened the ativan. 1mg, became .5mg, and soon that became .25mg. A quarter of a pill. and then a half for sleep. It was going well. I certainly wasn't 100%. I couldn't do long trips with my partner. He went to Vegas, alone. He went to Denver, alone. He went to Philadelphia for work, alone. He went to Mexico with his family, alone. I felt horrible. Making him do those things alone. All the while he never let go and neither did I. Things started to change yet again. 2023,  My mom fell dangerously ill, and after 3 days unconscious on life support. We found she was diagnosed with stage 4 metastatic breast caner. She's not much of a fighter but it really affected everyone including me.  July . Things started to change as  we began to look for a house. Apartment living was fine for me, but not him. I was content and wanting to work and progress more and more to being in a healthy mental state. House searching was kind of fun, if not a little disappointing. Man of the homes within price range were less than ideal. Run down, needing more than cosmetic updates. The proverbial straw that broke the camels back. My partner decided that a home was a must, not just a want. A home nearby was disgusting. A man who lived there smoked inside for decades. The immediate smell of cigarette smoke was noxious. The walls yellowed and again needing more work than was desired. Behind my back my partner put in an offer after had said that was more work that i ever wanted to put into a home. I was hurt, They declined his offer and I was relieved. He went forward and put in another offer on that shit hole. Luckily, they were playing dumb games with the place. We did not get it. I was relieved but Things were not well. I couldn't leave yet again, and that's when he decided to buy another home without me even seeing it. Purchased without my knowledge. He was struggling with his own problems and that was his solution. It broke me. I couldn't even get to see the place. I struggled more and more. I finally found a great therapist i Am loving talking too. But too little too late.   Eventually moving day came. I had to come live with my parents again, a hostile an sick environment i had left years ago. worsened by my moms sickness and inability to recover. I ended up in my old bedroom that had been filled with everyone's crap and when I arrived had no space of my own. My meds (lexapro) had yet again failed me. They started causing negative side effects. Nausea, headaches, dizziness, fatigue. I didn't want to take them anymore. But as anyone who has taken ssri medications before. The withdrawals are terrible as well. My doctor has not been very responsive. Finally I was given the new prescription of Setraline 50mg. I thought that was too much and decide to take half. 25mg. And i was greeted with Mania, hyper active feelings that were awful. I also had one of the worst nights of sleep, not even ativan could touch, the rapid heartbeat I could feel in my ears and chest. I contacted my doctor yet again, only to met with "" this can sometimes unleash bi polar disorder"" of which i know i do not struggle with as this was only initiated by the medication. Not a suggestion of another. just keep on it and deal with it. I was dealing with crappy side effects and yet again same thing. Im terrified to take them again. I'm so run down and just want to give up. Emotionally, physically, mentally, spiritually drained and ready to give up. I keep fighting, but for what? everyone is always saying ""ask for help"" and I do, and get told others have things going on and are unavailable to help. Im just done. Thanks if anyone actually reads this all. <3

95,freaking out about my dog's anesthesia (tw?),"my dog is having a dental procedure done tomorrow under anesthesia and i am suddenly freaking out about it even though he has done it before and been okay. he's 11 years old and still very healthy and acts like a puppy (he's a little dog so somewhat expected) but anesthesia is scary as it is and now that he's older, i'm terrified something is going to happen. he's had two dentals before and he was obviously neutered when he was a puppy, but i can't get over the fact that something could happen. on top of the normal fears, i swear i saw a tiktok months and months ago where a girl said her dog went in for routine surgery that they had done before and ended up passing away from the anesthesia. i fully trust my vet and i know that rationally my dog will be okay, but i just can't get the possibility out of my head. i know the vet will take care of him and will have a whole team to monitor him and wake him up if he has any sort of reaction, but i'm still terrified. he's my best friend in the entire world and i am not prepared to live without him.

96,feeling anxious for (kind of) no reason,"I‚Äôm feeling really anxious right now because of work but also kind of for no reason.

it started a few hours ago when I saw someone responded to a listing I had put up for items for sale at work. the inquiry just looked really sketchy and idk why but I thought it was a scam or even someone wanting to harm us! I texted it to my boss and she responded WTH and idk why but it gave me chills (she didn‚Äôt even think the response was sketchy though, she just couldn‚Äôt believe they were asking for a huge discount).

97,Need Some Advice,"

I think I‚Äôve been having anxiety symptoms from what I‚Äôve read and people have told me. I have no clue what triggers it because my life is fairly stress free. Good job, happy marriage, baby on the way and everything is good. But at time I get a tingly sensation down my body on my left side. Normally in my hands and feet but more recently in my face like cheeks and jaw. I would occasionally feel chest irritation or tightness in my left side. I also went to the ER probably 2 months the morning after a night out with some friends because my heart was racing and beating fast. I don‚Äôt really drink often. I‚Äôm healthy and athletic and all my blood working readings and heart rate are fairly normal.  

Does anyone know what could be causing this or solutions to help me stop it? Any input is appreciated. "
98,can't stop comparing to others,"I don't like what I am, and I'm always observing other people's bodies and personalities, finding things I like and wishing I could be like that, but I can't, and even if I try, it isn't really who I am, I'm faking it, trying to be something I'm not. But I don't really know who I am. I'm not being clear I think.
 I would like to know myself better, but I sometimes feel like a thing with no form at all. Boring, uninteresting. 
Last year I was in a relationship with who was my best friend, and this feeling caused me so much anxiety, feeling unworthy, not enough, and like at any given moment he was going to get bored at me, and find someone better. I externalized this feelings, and I guess with time he got tired of my issues, because he broke up with me.but even more I hate the fact that I thought he was sooo interesting, and I'm not like that, so it was just a matter of time for him to leave me, even as my friend. This is stupid, I'm not making any sense, but I just get this feeling in my chest, I don't understand it completely and a feeling of not wanting to be with other people, because if km alone km fine, there's no one to compare to, it's just me, being what I want, and not thinking to much about it, but around people I start this observing and comparing.
I tried therapy, but I feel like I'm not explaining myself correctly, and overtime I feel I'm just exaggerating and don't need it at all, just being dramatic. But other time I notice the impact it has un my life, fkr example in my relationship, and in the past with my friends, but I still feel, everytime I tell the therapist about this, like I'm not fully explaining, or that I'm exaggerating 


if anyone is feeling something somewhat similar and can help me to articulate it or also if you have any advice kn how stop comparing so much

106,I managed to go to the gym without having an anxiety attack,"I'm 24 years old and have been dealing with anxiety since I was 14. I've already given up doing some activities because of my anxiety before. At the age of 15, I stopped taking dance classes because I was anxious and I never participated in any sport at my school for the same reason. I went to the gym when I was 17, on a doctor's recommendation and I remember going to the gym crying because I was very anxious.

 In 2022, I started going to therapy after I started having anxiety attacks that took me to the hospital. On numerous occasions the therapist recommended that I go to the gym, with the aim of exposing myself to people and dealing with my social anxiety. It took me a while due to economic reasons (and lack of courage), but after almost two years of therapy, the psychologist considered that I was able to deal with social situations on my own.

  
This month, I finally signed up for a gym. Yesterday was my first day. At first, just the thought of going made me quite anxious and I was scared to go. I created many scenarios in my head about how I would handle the situation. Just signing up for the gym involved contacting many people: getting in touch with instructors to find out the gym's opening hours, the cost of monthly fees, how it works, etc. After scheduling an workout, it dawned on me that I had actually signed up for a gym and had to go. I even thought about giving up, but if my psychologist believes I'm ready, then I'm ready and I tried to keep that in mind.

  
I also took some precautions, such as wearing comfortable clothes that made me feel safe and taking a t-shirt if I felt uncomfortable because I felt too exposed. But despite that, I didn't have any crisis. No shortness of breath, chest pain, stomach pain or panic attack. Today I went again and it was peaceful. So I'm very excited! I still feel awkward being in an environment with so many people, but no one pays attention to me except for the gym owner (he was my teacher in elementary school and is friends with my brothers), so that brings me comfort."

My PCP last month noticed a bulge in my left inner ear, he claimed it would go away. Then a month later another doctor noticed that it was no longer there but noticed something swollen inside my left nostril. One doctor said take Flonase and another one told me not to take it. 

I have an appointment tomorrow to discuss my symptoms more but something tells me I need a MRI, CT, and ENT doctor to examine me.

I recently got married last summer to my newlywed wife, who's 18 and also Pakistani Muslim American. Our marriage was arranged by our parents and families, and I love her so much. I can't stop thinking about her and taking care of her, and being the man she deserves for life and loving her. We were engaged for roughly 6 weeks after I graduated college last year in May 2023, and then the same week she graduated high school in June 2023, we were married. Now, recently, we found out that my wife is pregnant, and I am terrified! Like, where did my life go? 

Also, we live with my parents, and I still live at home. I am an analyst at a large company that's a Fortune 500, making good money. My family and parents are a blessing by God, and amazing. My wife is happy and everything, but this is so fast. Also, for anyone who's wondering, yes, I was a virgin before marriage, and it just naturally happened when my wife and I were alone on our wedding night, and we began a loving sexual relationship together. Well, here we are. Also, I told my parents she's too young, and I'm too young for marriage, but since I got a degree and a good job and was established, and also she graduated high school, my wife and came from a big family of many sisters and brothers, and my father-in-law is old, now a few years short of 70, everyone thought it was a good idea for her to marry. 

Stupidly, I told my parents last year, or well, back in 2022 when I met my then 16-year-old wife for the first time, and I was 21, that I'm gonna marry her, and that it was love at first sight because she's so beautiful, and their family is amazing and wonderful. But yeah, I didn't think they would do this. And I also said yes to the marriage because I mean, why not? Plus, my only excuse was that I'm not interested, but I had a paranoia that if I wouldn't have a wife now, maybe I never would have. What do I do? I'm not ready for a baby, and also, 

I'm not really even ready for marriage, but I am and I do my best to be a loving, caring man to my wife and to love her every second and always make her my first priority. But what do I do? I literally am getting anxiety attacks."
111,Paranoia: Being Pranked/Hunted. ,"Walking into my games design class with my fellows. 

Was having a pleasant discussion with them about this game called ‚ÄòTop Banana,‚Äô and how it killed someone with epilepsy. 

As we sit down to further discuss the topic, my eyes drift around the room‚Äîcasually scanning my surroundings. 

Whilst I‚Äôm talking, I pick-up on how someone‚Äôs mysteriously written ‚ÄúHi ___‚Äù on the whiteboard situated on the back corner of the classroom; the ‚Äú___‚Äù being my name... 

I‚Äôm pretty shocked by this‚Äîespecially considering the fact the handwriting was near-identical to mine. 

This whiteboard is plagued with cringeworthy doodles; these are all done by the other games design students‚Äîthe ones in year(s) above us. 

There‚Äôs absolutely no chance my friends‚Äîor anyone in my class would be responsible for this; I know them; they‚Äôre all just like me: Mature, relaxed‚Äîsimply trying to get by, and not cause trouble to others. They‚Äôve never pulled any pranks on me; this simply isn‚Äôt a possibility. 

My entire class is small, with only 7 people (including me). 

By now, I am almost certain this is the doing of the insufferable creatures in the grade(s) above my class (although, I have many other, more fat-fetched theories).

Our course has a group Discord server‚Äîwhich contains everyone studying the subject‚Äîso that we may ask for feedback, and communicate on ideas (or just socialise; but that doesn‚Äôt happen). 

I ask who‚Äôs responsible in the server, and I get a vague reply from some freak: ‚ÄúThe Observers‚Äù‚Äîhe says. 

I simply questioned: ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù These were my exact words. 

And then, some other fucker adds just: ‚ÄúProbably.‚Äù

I responded with: ‚Äú?‚Äù And have since gotten no reply. 

People also reacted to their messages with the ‚ÄúüëÄ‚Äù and ‚ÄúüëÅÔ∏è‚Äú emojis‚Äîpeople who haven‚Äôt spoken on the matter‚Äîso it‚Äôs clear they‚Äôre in on it to some degree. 

Clearly, they‚Äôre trolling me. But, i‚Äôm really bothered by this; I haven‚Äôt spoken to them once; I keep to myself; I haven‚Äôt done anything to them. 

I also can‚Äôt tell if they‚Äôre making fun of me; if so: Why? I understand I sound like a weirdo from the absurdity of this whole post, but I‚Äôm really just minding my own business here. 

I‚Äôm beyond pissed-off by the lack of answers I‚Äôm getting, and I‚Äôm incredibly frightened; I‚Äôve been contemplating some pretty extreme acts towards myself to alleviate the stress. 

I feel completely on edge; these past few weeks have had me feeling as though the whole world is out to get me. I don‚Äôt feel safe, ever; I keep having horrific dreams about being harmed, or killed by a demented psychopath‚Äîthat, and nuclear armageddon. Every time I hear a loud noise I want to fucking run for my life. I‚Äôm writing this now, and the heavy wind blowing against my window‚Äîwhistling through the tiny gaps of the walls (poorly built dormer) sounds like the cries of a thousand people‚Äîas if they‚Äôre all being burned alive in a lake of fire. Sometimes, I‚Äôll hear noises outside my house‚Äîsomeone moving a heavy object, it sounds like; I can‚Äôt tell if someone‚Äôs trying to break-in to my house. 

No-one knows how I feel; I‚Äôm really struggling; no-one knows how afraid I am all the time. I want this world to be quiet, and stop being so fucking crazed and insane. 

That‚Äôs all.

113,Is what I experience something you experience too?,"TW: self harm I suppose

Hello, I am posting here because I have something I \*suppose\* it is anxiety but I do not have a diagnosis, I am not looking for one here, I am seeing a physician for that in a few days. It is really hard for me to describe what I experience, I have trouble with knowing what I feel in general, so I am not sure what it is or whether it is serious or not, and I am afraid I fail to convey it to the physician and I do not feel legitimate asking for help provided that most people probably have it much worse than me. This is why I am asking you this; does it sound like something you experience too?

  
I do not have the physical symptoms commonly associated with anxiety such as shortness of breath, trembling, fast heart rate, sweating. However, I always wake up way too early (like 1 or 2 hours before the alarm), then I feel stressed and I cannot go back to sleep. I take melatonin but it doesn't solve this issue. Sometimes I feel ok, and sometimes I worry a lot, without much objective reason, but it is like having a dashboard warning light blinking constantly without knowing why. I can become very stressed about things not that important, I become very tense and irritable, then I argue with people in my head, have negative and catastrophist self talk. Since I have always been like this (I think) I can deal with it; deep down I know this feeling is just temporary but this won't make it go away. If circumstances make it worse, everything becomes unbearable, most stimulations (such as noise, or much worse, touch) become too much, I cannot really think anymore, I just want to run to hide somewhere safe to curl into a ball and scream and cry (it is really hard for me to cry because of emotional blunting, but I feel I need to and I can't, just like when you suffer from nausea but cannot puke while you really would like to). At this stage if I am alone I may kick and punch walls, or hit my hands together. As stupid as it sounds, pain has a temporary soothing effect, and bruises left by this are usually not visible (though they can hurt for days).

  
One situation which makes me feel bad like this is when I have nothing to do, so I cannot really chill. I cannot get either why people enjoy travelling or going on vacation as it seems so stressful to me, so I cannot really think about it as a way to rest. I feel I am totally exhausted but I feel I cannot rest. I do not know whether this is normal or not, maybe most people just deal with it. Mind you, I have been on vacation alone twice, and felt okay most of the time, and I hold an executive job. However, I live my live avoiding stressful situations so I feel bad only part of the time, but there are tons of things that normal people seem to do with ease and which cost me a lot. It is very possible that I am simply too weak and too lazy and I am just looking for excuses; I really don't know; I don't know what happens to me and I don't even know whether something at all happens to me, and that uncertainty is probably wearing me down."
114,Anxiety or something else?,"Hi, everyone! First time poster here, although I have visited the subreddit on few occasions these past few months :)

I have been dealing with some symptoms that may be related to anxiety, but I want to know if anyone else faced something similar, since I couldn't really find more specific info online. 

So, in order to have the full picture: back in summer, I had to go to the ER due to a medical emergency. Nothing serious fortunately, but I did require surgery in order to avoid future complications. Everything went well, recovery was good, but they did tell me that they noticed something weird about my heart on the EKG and that I should get it checked.

A few months pass and come November, I had some weird chest pains that lingered for a few days, then simply went away. I was instantly reminded about what they told me back in summer, and I started worrying for a bit, but figured I would get those investigations done soon and see if there is anything wrong. 

Shortly after I started experiencing something else, and this is the central point of my post: difficulty swallowing and feeling like I am suffocating because of that. Often times whenever I was eating it was like my muscles forgot how to swallow and I would have a few moments of panic, before finally being able to swallow the food. This happens only with solid foods and spit,  but not with liquids. 

Things get progressively worse in December, culminating in mid January when I have a full on panic attack while working. In addition, a bunch of other weird symptoms appear until the beginning of February, such as:

* tingling/numbness in my fingers and sometimes toes
* fidgeting/twitching toes and feet
* neck pains and a feeling of pressure in the back of my head
* shoulder pain
* visual snow and other sight problems
* sudden pressure in my ears, usually followed by intense tinnitus (usually in the right one)

In the meantime I visit a doctor who recommends doing some tests, and the results are fine. My heart is also in good shape (although I need to do some exercise) and my thyroid is also fine (this was recommended due to my swallowing problem).  I have also started taking Magnesium supliments, at my doctor's recommendation. 

After seeing the results, these symptoms seem to have died down, but I still occasionally get them. I believe they may be strictly tied to anxiety, since they tend to appear  more often when I am feeling stressed, or if my mind is unoccupied.  If I am deeply focused on some other activity (like playing music or being very focused on my work tasks), I rarely (if ever) experience these symptoms.

I am 99% percent sure this is just health anxiety caused by my medical episode from summer (which I do admit, has left quite a mark on me). 

I still need to do some tests, but I am pretty sure they will turn out fine. Nonetheless, the occasional choking sensations, or some weird feeling in my ear is enough to set me off course for a bit and make me feel like I may have a heart attack or a stroke :) 

I posted this because I wanted to know if others have gone through something similar, and if they can share their experience and offer some advice. 

Thanks! :D

I‚Äôm so shy, and soft spoken, and my voice gets so shaky and high when I‚Äôm nervous and it‚Äôs so childish and it‚Äôs been made fun of before and I understand why. I feel so ashamed that I‚Äôm not smart and don‚Äôt understand things when they‚Äôre explained to me. I‚Äôm always really irrational. I got a 88 on a math test and I felt so ashamed and disappointed, and just so anxious my stomach hurt. I know it‚Äôs not rational but I just feel I did so terrible and it‚Äôs all my fault. And I keep making mistakes and during the chemistry quiz I tried but I was clueless while drawing the molecules. And during physics, I‚Äôm so lost. Just lost and I want to help my group but they‚Äôre so smart, and fast and I‚Äôm always behind.

I‚Äôm just so afraid I won‚Äôt get a job, or a boyfriend, and won‚Äôt be an independent adult that can provide for myself. I just want to make my parents and myself happy; but I really hate myself. I‚Äôm not pretty. And I hate my personality. I just wish I was like the other girls who are smart pretty and confident. I get such dark thoughts when I get a grade below a 90. I‚Äôm just so scared.

117,Is getting Xanax really that difficult now? I am starting to get worried.,"So my PCP had prescribed me Xanax for about 16 years now, taken as needed. I took a bit more early on (but never even close to daily), but in the last 5-6 years I've taken on average one 0.5mg pill per month. So I get prescribed 30 pills at a time and that would last me about 2 years.

I've gotten very good about managing my anxiety without medication (in fact I've never taken anything specifically for anxiety except Xanax), but there are times I absolutely need Xanax or I can't function, mostly on vacation. I can't even think about getting on a plane without one, or going out for a night on the town in some strange place, etc.

I had just taken for granted my script gets renewed when I run out, but my PCP retired a couple of months ago. I'm still going to the same hospital so they should have my records and my long history with Xanax, but now I'm worried the next time I need it I won't be able to get it. I had no idea it was getting so restrictive. I'm guessing the smart move would be to at least ask my new doctor if she will keep renewing my prescription, before I actually run out? And then if not, I guess I need to look for a doctor who will?"

I thought it was normal to hear your heartbeat in your head almost everyday, to feel so tense, nauseous, to have headaches so often without knowing why, then I learnt that it wasn't, I just thought I was born fragile, that I had some sort of hidden illness and it's true, although not in the way I thought, but how does it help knowing that I have an anxiety disorder? I can't even take medecine, I dream of talking to a therapist, of getting rid of this, of these thoughts, these doubts, these strange feelings, I don't feel like I'm part of reality, i either lower the sound of the world so much that I don't hear anything or I let it overwhelm me. 
I've learnt to live with it, to accept the anxiety and it's ramifications as parts of myself but I just want to have a glimpse of what it feels like to have a normal life, I feel like I'm going crazy and nobody knows, like I have this thing inside of me, this insect in my chest that's getting bigger and eating me away, I have to act like I'm doing fine when I'm imploding. I thought letting people read some of my thoughts would help me, I don't know how I feel about this, maybe I'll delete it in the morning."
119,Job Interviews,"The feedback I get most often after interviewing or presenting is to ""be confident."" I feel as though I have no business being ""confident"" when discussing myself, and envisioning myself engaging with an audience or another individual in that way feels ridiculous. I'm fortunate to have had enriching career experiences, however, I fail to sell these points."
120,Is there a word for this,"When I get anxious sometimes there‚Äôs no build up but a sudden feel of surrealness. Like my surroundings are both too real and also kind of dreamlike. I feel like something is going to happen and I put a hand on my chest or neck to feel my heartbeat. Partially to see if I‚Äôm anxious and have a high heart rate and partly to check if I‚Äôm dying. 

There‚Äôs no hallucinations but things seem different. Colours are more noticeable despite no vision changes. The air is noticeably static or windy. Heightened perception I guess. 

I don‚Äôt think typical grounding techniques will work because I‚Äôm already aware of my surroundings and focussing on that feels worse but I can comfort myself by reminding me I‚Äôm okay, I‚Äôm not going to die. I almost immediately feel better when I find out what caused it. For example I had too much caffeine the other day but didn‚Äôt realise until a bit after I went into this state. It doesn‚Äôt last very long. If I‚Äôm in the doctors waiting room I have to actively try to not sink into it.

Backstory, all the way back in grade 1 I had a big seizure.  Was diagnosed with epilepsy and have been fine ever since.  Over a decade later I have never had another seizure and have been declared seizure free.  There also isn‚Äôt a family history of seizures at all.  However last may I started to experience these intense episodes of Deja vu.  They lasted about 4-10 seconds.  And I started to freak out about temporal lobe epilepsy.  Fast forward almost a year and I now can‚Äôt go an hour without getting one.  I have seen two neurologists, both have said that they think I‚Äôm fine, I have had an eeg run, and it came back clean.

127,Does benzo tolerance ever go back down?,"I have been taking a benzo (lorazepam) maybe once a week or less for about 10 months now. When I started on .25mg, it was incredibly effective. Now, 2mg is not very effective most of the time. I do not want to increase my dose further for obvious reasons (I'm not sure if my psychiatrist would even be willing, even if I did want to).

129,(mention of drugs),"Hey everyone,  
  
I'm a 16-year-old kid from Sicily, and I'm in a really tough spot right now. I don't know where else to turn, so I thought I'd reach out here for some advice and support.  
  
So, here's the deal. I've been struggling with addiction for a while now, and it's gotten to the point where I feel like I'm losing control. I've been using toad venom and fermenting grains to make moonshine, and it's taking over my life. I know it sounds crazy.  
  
I first got into this stuff when I was around 14, just experimenting with different things to see what would happen. I started with the toad venom because I heard it could give you a crazy high, and I wanted to see for myself. It started out as just a curiosity, but then it turned into something more.  
  
My room has turned into a makeshift toad sanctuary, with multiple tanks filled with different species.  
  
I have to admit, I own a few toads as pets, and I've been using them to get high off of their venom. I know it's messed up, but I can't seem to stop myself. And then there's the moonshine. I started making it because I thought it would be cool to have my own homemade alcohol, but now I can't go a day without it.  
  
It's affecting every aspect of my life. My grades are slipping, I'm always tired and irritable, and I can't seem to focus on anything else. I've tried to quit on my own, but it's like I'm trapped in this cycle of addiction."

131,Living somewhere that‚Äôs making me sick,"I‚Äôve always lived with manageable anxiety that came and went. I never had any issues so debilitating until I moved to where I am now.

I‚Äôve been to so many specialists feeling physically sick, everyone says it‚Äôs anxiety (except had a pulmonologist tell me I should move due to the air quality affecting me). I hate where I live and want to move back to the previous state I lived in and love, but have reached a point of such bad anxiety I fear what if I don‚Äôt go back to normal. While I was still able to travel, every time I would visit somewhere else I felt fined then coming back here I felt horrible. Has anyone else dealt with this or something similar?

133,IV meds caused a terrible reaction‚Ä¶. is it all in my head?,"A few years ago, i went to the hospital (and to be honest, i completely forgot the reason why). all i can remember was that they gave me medication through an IV mixed with Benadryl. shortly after administering it, it felt like i was being microwaved, and my heart rate shot up to 140. the nurse left and came back and told me that he didnt put the medication in the correct order, meaning he was supposed to administer the benadryl first, and then the other medication (possibly vice versa, i forgot which order he was supposed to give it to me). in the end he gave me a sedative to calm me down, and ever since that day i‚Äôve been nervous about having an IV.

after that incident, it took me a long time to become okay with them even pushing saline. i would become nervous, because i could feel the cold saline through my veins, but after a few hospital trips, i became okay with saline.

a few weeks ago i went to the ER because of a tension headache that would not go away. the nurse gave me an IV and said she was going to give me toradol, reglan, and benadryl. i started to get anxious when she said benadryl, because i kept thinking about what happened a few years ago. when i told her what happened she looked at me like i was crazy, or like shes never heard of anything like that before. she said she would administer the medication slowly, and i agreed. i didnt watch her push the medication through, because i knew if i did watch her i would just freak myself out. however while she was pushing the medications i started to hyperventilate and my body had a reaction. it felt like my chest was sinking and i felt extremely nauseous, and i had an anxiety attack. it took my about 30 minutes to calm down, and i became drowsy due to the benadryl.

basically my question is, could this have been some sort of reaction from the benadryl? it seems to be the common denominator here and i don‚Äôt believe ive ever taken benadryl unless it was given to me in the hospital both of those times. it just seems so silly to me that something as simple as benadryl could cause this, so maybe its all in my head? has this ever happened to anyone else before?"
134,Constant tight feeling in stomach without actually thinking anything ,Hello all hope you are well!

136,Nervous about starting sertraline again,"29(F), after months of increasing anxiety and panic my GP prescribed me sertraline again. I was on it a few years ago and it worked great considering everything I was going through, and then again last summer but I stopped taking it after two months because I blames my weight gain on it.
Now it‚Äôs prescribed again (50mg) and I‚Äôm terrified of the possible side effects (seizure, coma, serotonin syndrome,‚Ä¶headaches). 
I know I‚Äôve been on it before and don‚Äôt remember having an issue aside from maybe the headaches at first, but now I‚Äôm scared to take it again looking at the more serious side effects. 
I‚Äôve been an absolute chaotic mess and I know I need help for the anxiety, but I practically panicked over taking a single Advil and haven‚Äôt experienced medication anxiety before.
Has anyone had experience with this? Should I maybe just try to continue with therapy and hope it gets better on its own?"

139,Am I Autistic?,"I joined a new school for sixth form in september and I met one of my now best friends through a friend of a friend so we were already familiar with each other. However, she said that one of the first things she noticed about me is that she thinks i‚Äôm autistic. At first when she mentioned it i took no notice and thought it was a joke, but then i started to think about it more, and it started to explain some things about me that i couldn‚Äôt provide an answer for before. I also trust her instinct because her little brother is autistic lmao. 

A few things she mentioned is that I cannot hold eye contact for the life of me, I think I can when i‚Äôm listening to someone else but when i‚Äôm explaining something to someone i just look everywhere else but them. Apparently i‚Äôm not very good at expressing my emotions or depicting other people‚Äôs emotions either, which is true lmao. it‚Äôs also one of the main reasons why i sometimes get into little arguments with my friends, just purely based on poorly judged social cues that i don‚Äôt easily pick up. 

I also hyper fixate on a lot of things at once for about a week and then change on to something new the next. this also ties in a little bit to repetitive behaviour, i make repeated little movements like banging my legs against chairs (which gets on one of my friends nerves lmao) or tapping constantly. i also repeat random catchphrases a lot. 

One big thing for me that indicates autism is change. This could be anything from a change in a school schedule (like a lesson being moved to a different room) or a change in a daily routine. God this is the one thing that actually affects me and i could name so many examples of where change has really thrown me off. whenever something different or unexpected happens to me i get a pit in my stomach and feel extremely overwhelmed and i get all flustered. for example, the first couple weeks of changing school in September was very hard for me because it was a last minute decision, i remember crying on the way to school everyday and feeling very very stressed. and it wasn‚Äôt cause i didn‚Äôt like the school or anything it was just the feeling of immense sudden change. along with being at a new school, the feeling of having completely new people around me who i don‚Äôt know makes me really overwhelmed too. i‚Äôm not very good at making friends, not because im a mean person or anything, it‚Äôs just purely based on the fact that i can‚Äôt cope with my friendship group expanding (changing) in any way. the whole new school thing has calmed down a bit though cause it‚Äôs become part of the daily routine so it‚Äôs not that bad anymore.

One story from when i was younger also sticks out to me a lot: 
I wanna say when i was around 7??? i used to have attachment to certain items and would have genuine feelings for them, like a cushion for example. I would feel bad if it accidentally fell on the floor and i would feel extremely guilty about it. One time my dad was putting on his socks and he found they had holes in so he had asked me to put them in the bin, i remember taking them and crying because i felt actual sympathy for a pair of socks - so i hid them instead of throwing them away. looking back now its so weird but like‚Ä¶ is it explainable???

There‚Äôs also so many more little stories that come to my head that could be an example of autism for me. but i guess i just wanted to hear some feedback from other people to see if im crazy. "
140,Propranolol,"Hi, just started propranolol 40mg 1x a day, today was my first day and whilst I have not had a panic attack (which is good) I do feel fairly zoned out, like quite detached..

141,Feeling of going crazy due to anxiety,"I know this is a normal part of chronic anxiety, i just wanna vent. 

I just feel like i am going crazy lately. Sometimes i fear i will just randomly keel over from a heart attack, or that I will really ""lose it this time"" and need to be hospitalized. 

I was always an anxious kid, but i wasnt diagnosed with GAD until 7th grade. Im 24 now. I have always been on survival mode due to anxiety and cptsd. I have crazy health/death anxiety. Recently, though, its been unbearable. More panic attacks. It takes me so long to fall asleep because im so anxious. I wake up anxious. Im anxious throughout the day. I have nightmares almost every night. Im always fearful of my health, my loved ones health, all my cats health. I dread the day i suffer a loss (my familys young, so i havent experienced close loss). Ive lost multiple pets due to random events. Some traumatic, some random health declines, but none have made it to senior age. Hence why im terrified of my cats health

I am terrified to take any new medication, so im in a horrible loop of: not taking any anxiety meds despite needing them, feeling anxious when i do take my prescribed meds, scared to change any of them despite it not working for me anymore (ex: depo shot cause it fuckin sucks yet im still on it cause im scared to try anything new)

Yes, im in therapy right now, but im gonna lose it soon due to being poor and having to live on my own, and, frankly, my therapist is a student and she is not very helpful, but i needed someone and she is very sweet and needs more experience.

Im gonna have to get a job soon too, and i havent had one for years now. Everything about this terrifies me. Makes me nauseous.

Im nauseous every day. I have pains and aches every day. I just feel like i cant escape this hell. Im literally terrified to live.

Anyway, thanks for letting me vent. Dunno what to do about any of this, but venting always helps

142,Need advice or tips for managing anxiety,"So for context I've been on Escitalopram (also known as Lexapro) 10mg for a year already and I got so much better a few months ago because my situation got better, so I thought of stop taking them (slowly of course and after consulting my doc) but my situation got worse recently and so I was told to keep taking them. I've been having chest tightness for a while on and off...

I have been told to try breathing exercises and go outside. The exercises only work for like 2 minutes and then I'm back to square one. Walking and going outside kind of helps but also thinking of going out when I want to do so many things at home and people in general give me anxiety and I don't know how to force myself...

Do any of you have any tips for calming down? Or to do when feeling extra anxious or just helping relieve anxiety in general? It gets especially bad at night when I'm trying to sleep... Takes so long to fall asleep, I feel like I get our of breath, feel gassy, etc. it's annoying and worrying. Ofc the usual feeling of ""am I having a heart attack""/lung problems?

143,"Anxious GF always talking about herself, what do I do?","My girlfriend suffers from anxiety, depression, bipolar, and BPD. We both also thinks she has ADHD. We are both 27 y/o and I am a Male. We have been moved in together after the first 4 months.

I don't have any mental illnesses that I know of, other than anxiety under specific stressful situations. I mainly have health anxiety.

We have been together for about a year a half. One thing I noticed that has always stayed consistent is throughout each day and every day, she always talks about herself and her issues, and depending on which topic, how strong she is for over coming certain issues. I used to talk a lot, but I have noticed over the last number of months, I have become introverted because many conversations are always about her and if I do speak it results in more anxiety and negativity directed at me. To be honest, it's not only when she vents. Her responses more often then not are passive aggressive or negative.

There are a few problems I have. From the first few minutes I wake up each day, I am always greeted with some issue that she faced the day before or a consistent issue that she had been facing from the past. And it's almost like the second we wake up, she just HAS to vent about said issue again, even if it's already been talked about multiple times. And said issue, will consistently come up throughout the day and into the night when I get home. And she really shows her emotions, so it's not always a ""calm"" venting session, it's often anger and negativity. And almost always results in getting worse when I speak, whether it's a response to help or a ""honest truth"" type of an answer.

To be perfectly honest, I feel that we almost never have any conversations that are relative to me or my own thoughts, or work days, or even conversations that directly reflect both of us together as a couple. Each conversation we have is almost always about her. It irritates me because I would like to wake up without any negativity right off the bat, and same thing when I come home. The last thing I want, specifically after listening to negativity from her all day and work stress, is to engage even further into negative conversations about the same thing that she has not let go of, when I get home from work. It bothers me because often her negative energy about whatever she has going on, causes me massive anxiety because of the fact that she's putting off that energy. Like even though it's her venting about her issues, I take her emotions so personally. And I don't know how not to.

I have tried speaking about it in the past, and it has often resulted in her saying things like, ""well f*** me then I'll just stop talking to you"" or ""I guess I can't talk to my boyfriend about anything"" or things related to that. Very often her way of ""communicating"" causes fights, because it's always filled with negativity and anger that's directed at me. Her response to this is that ""her anger isn't directed at me, it's only because I'm the only one she has to talk to, so I receive those emotions"" I honestly try my best to stay calm but those types of responses almost every time trigger my anger and make me respond negatively. I hate that it affects me like that. But I'm not sure what else to do, how am I supposed to respond to negative emotions that I know result in increased anxiety and stress for me? Our relationship is holding on by threads because of the way she reacts and talks to me. How do I stop taking her venting emotionally all the time so personally? How do I allow myself to be okay with the fact she talks about her self so much?


**EDIT: The issues she vents about pertain to her work issues, the family issues she has, or just about any other issue under the sun that has to do with her. The issues she vents about are not related to me or us as a couple**"
144,Loss of priprioception and like 85% complete numbness ,"So I've been diagnosed adhd for 3 months. I declined getting my anxiety treated, and have just been prescribed adderall. I have no history of actual physical panic attacks until this semester, no anxious thoughts anymore, but just sudden and random physical attacks

Today was my last day before spring break and I had two back to back exams. I felt confident about the material during it, but seemingly out of nowhere, 30 mins I gradually realized I had almost no feeling anywhere on my body, and I had no spacial awareness of where my limbs were at. It was only after this I started to majorly freak out and think what the fuck is this. I'd adjust my legs, and I could hardly feel anything and after I made to decision to use my muscles, it'd feel like they just kinda teleported and bumped into each other. My hand/arms/face were the same way. Couldn't feel myself grabbing my pencil or mouse until I literally watched the mouse move.                                                                  

I was able to calm my heart down from the initial freak out pretty cause I knew there wasn't an actual issue, but I was just worried cause like I can't feel my goddamn limbs. I finish my test and go walk to my next one and it's like I'm playing qwop with my body, I was just lucky I had 20 years of practice walking. My next test I wasn't nervous about it, and I wasn't that tired, but I just couldn't feel anything still until like 2 hours ago. But like what the actual hell was that? I never have bad side effects from my meds, and I sleep good enough now to sustain 5 hrs a night for 5 days at a time.

145,"The type of anxiety that lasts for days (TW: passive suicidal ideation, imagery of burning, explicit descriptions of constant anxiety)","One thing can set me off, and even if I‚Äôve resolved it, even if I‚Äôve packed up the problem and I‚Äôve put it in its little slot on a shelf at the back of my mind, I still feel like my skin is on fire. Like I‚Äôm going to burn and destroy anything I touch. Sometimes I don‚Äôt even have to touch things, or be near them, to feel like I‚Äôm still screwing everything up.

I know people use the word ‚Äòspiral‚Äô when they‚Äôre talking about that toxic decent into intrusive thinking for maybe hours at a time - mine lasts for days. I sleep on it. I wake up on it.

I know I‚Äôm not the only one that feels this way but it‚Äôs hard to put words on it with people who know you personally. Nothing fits. English doesn‚Äôt work anymore. 

It‚Äôs disabling sometimes, *debilitating.* I feel like I‚Äôm chasing this feeling of safety and stability without even being able to see what I‚Äôm running after, and when I find it, it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm holding glass in my hands that I‚Äôve just gotta watch melt and disintegrate between my fingers.

147,My current situation with health anxiety.,"Hey guys, I really just wanted to spill what I‚Äôve been going through this past couple of months/years with my health and how it effects me for some advice on how other people have potentially coped with similar situations,
I‚Äôm a 25 year old male with ‚Äúself diagnosed‚Äù health anxiety I say self diagnosed because no one has ever sat down and said to me hey you have this, but it‚Äôs pretty well known with myself and my go surgery I do, most recently I‚Äôve ran into the hardest part of it all and that‚Äôs anxiety surrounding my heart, a couple of weeks back I was sat in work having a relatively normal day and felt a slight amount of chest pain, didn‚Äôt think much of it but I didn‚Äôt have much going on so I almost fixated on it for a while and it never seemed to really go away, despite health anxiety being rampant for years this didn‚Äôt really trigger me as mostly my anxiety existed around some difficulties I‚Äôve had with my stomach, but nevertheless just three days later I was at my local a and e with my chest pain, I‚Äôd felt the muscles move in my chest the night before, a spasm of sorts likely from the stress I was putting myself under and decided I couldn‚Äôt risk it, which in retrospect of course always get these kind of symptoms checked out.

After a couple of hours of waiting multiple sets of OBS an ECG and an X-Ray the lovely nurses let me know I was doing the right thing to have it checked out but it seemed stress or anxiety related, at this time my partner was almost term with my first ever daughter and even though in the forefront I didn‚Äôt feel all that stressed or anxious maybe it was the cause, or I‚Äôd pulled a muscle of some sort, heh who knows I went home took my new painkillers and got on with life.

The chest pain came back and went throughout the next couple of weeks and I went back to the gp to get new painkillers to no avail but I started to fixate on new symptoms like slight pains in my thigh(obviously a case of DVT right? Couldn‚Äôt be anything else??) and relentlessly googling all of my symptoms to be told I‚Äôm dying over and over again.

I mostly managed to ignore th leg pain and the chest pain now at the back of my mind didn‚Äôt bother me all too much and my partner gave birth to my beautiful daughter 3 days ago via an emergency ciserean section, my doctor prescribed me some propalnol or however it‚Äôs spelt and I took them before going to the hospital to help with the physical stress/anxiety of it all and despite it being a horrible time I seemingly was relatively calm during the whole process until two days ago where I came home and my throat felt completely closed and my chest had a lot of pressure on the left hand side(it‚Äôs always the left?) I felt I had no choice but to go back to the A and E or ER for my Americans and sat for 15 hours waiting for another x-ray to be told everything from my bloods to my ecg to my OBS were all perfectly fine, amazing right bit I‚Äôve spent my last two nights with a racing heart and a feeling of extreme breathlessnes.

I even paid today to see a cardiologist privately who re-assured me there‚Äôs 0 evidence and very low risk that any of my issues are cardiac and found nothing on a physical assessment of me.

Serious question guys, do you‚Äôre palpitations make your heart race and feel as though it‚Äôs the end of your life? I lie here in bed right now with a beating heart only slowed by meds and even when slowed a feeling of pressure on my left chest and my throat closing up just trying to make it through another night.


If this so what stress and anxiety can cause me I really want out or some way to cope, any advice or relatability is greatly appreciated and I send love to anyone else dealing with anxiety and stress at this level."
148,Afraid of pancreatic cancer,"For the last month I‚Äôve (38/F) had this constant gnawing pain under my left shoulder and ribs that has only gotten worse.

All the meds supposed to help haven‚Äôt done anything and I still have light colored stools and nighttime reflux. The pain got so bad it wakes me up at night because it hurts more laying down. 

I went to the ER twice this last month but they gaslit me and didn‚Äôt do any imaging because my labs were normal. After begging my GI put in a stat order to get an mri for my pancreas. I got it done a couple days ago and I still don‚Äôt have the results. My GI hasn‚Äôt received them either. I‚Äôm a total mess and can‚Äôt stop crying thinking I won‚Äôt be around here much longer for my son. I had my psychiatrist prescribe me some clonezepam but I‚Äôm still having trouble holding it together because I can still feel the immense pain. I want to go back to the hospital to the emergency room, but my husband tells me he doesn‚Äôt think that‚Äôs going to do anything. I‚Äôm losing my mind and can‚Äôt get any work done and keep crying. No position is bringing me relief. I haven‚Äôt had a good night sleep in several days.

151,Death Anxiety is Ruining My Life ,"I‚Äôm a personal injury paralegal who just recently hit 34. I‚Äôve suffered from anxiety problems since I was in elementary school, and this has spun off into full-blown death anxiety several times. I had a few episodes in high school, due to my Christian upbringing never really taking and me beginning to contemplate what death means, and then another more severe one in college. About a week ago, I started having another spiral, and it‚Äôs threatening to ruin my life.

I don‚Äôt know what set this off, exactly. For a long time now, I‚Äôve just been focused on living day by day, either immersed in my work or my hobbies. I think some of it might be simply because of where I am in life - I have a stable job, but I‚Äôve only had this job for 3-odd years, half my income has to go into paying off my rent, and I can‚Äôt afford to save or invest much. I don‚Äôt have many ties to my community, and while I want a partner, I have no dating experience and am in the closet as a lesbian and planning to go in deeper at the rate America is going.

Like, fuck, I remember being 13 and teasing my dad over turning 40. I‚Äôll be 40 in six years. What do I have to show for it? I spent five years caring for my mother until her death in 2017 and two years scraping by at retail while I attended night classes to get my paralegal certificate. My 20s were supposed to be the best part of my life, and they went completely down the drain. My 30s have been a lot better but... that's kind of the end of the line, isn't it?

I think some of it is also just my job - I love what I do, but the fact remains that I‚Äôm being exposed to stories of other people‚Äôs deaths and trauma day in and day out. I thought I was compartmentalizing, but I guess I wasn‚Äôt. Maybe something just spilled over.

Whatever it is, I‚Äôm struggling. I‚Äôve suddenly gone from eagerly hitting my pillow at night to being afraid to sleep, from loving to cook and enjoy food to not enjoying any bite of food or any sip of water, and from throwing myself into my hobbies to feeling apathetic about them. I used to be super passionate about my job, and now it‚Äôs a chore to do anything. What‚Äôs the point of working or eating or enjoying myself or doing anything at all if I‚Äôm just going to stop existing one day? God, I'm so jealous of my mother - she was a religious woman who saw death as a release. I lost my faith at a young age and have nothing to cushion myself against the fear of oblivion. 

I went to a doctor on Tuesday and was put on Lexapro and Buspar, but it doesn‚Äôt seem to be doing anything yet past giving me panic attacks. I‚Äôm struggling to care for myself more than the bare minimum, can‚Äôt focus on anything past constantly reading up about death and mortality, and am wearing my exhaustion on my face. I want to get myself back before I really hit rock bottom, but I don‚Äôt know how to do this anymore.

153,Cymbalta & Ativan,"Tell me your experiences with these please- 
I‚Äôve always had side effects, depression/low mood/no motivation with SSRIs. Tried Wellbutrin and no luck there- anxiety, panic attacks, paranoid spirals only intensifying. 

 My psychiatrist wants me to try Cymbalta (SNRI) and also prescribed Ativan to use as needed to get through any particularly rough spots until I can get more stable (hopefully). I‚Äôm also re-starting intensive CBT which has helped in the past- I‚Äôm not just relying on meds and honestly have little faith in anything helping without awful side effects. "
154,What do I do in this situation?,"Hi! I don‚Äôt really know if this is the place to post this but I‚Äôve been having some issues for a while now and I just wanted to ask anonymously.

I‚Äôm 27M and whenever I feel anxious it just feels like my bladder is so full it‚Äôs about to explode. During my worst days, I would run to the restroom every 15 to 30 minutes to have barely any pee. Thankfully I haven‚Äôt had a day like that for a few months but when I‚Äôm stressed an hour still seems like an eternity. This is only when I‚Äôm anxious by the way. Whenever I‚Äôm at home and feel comfortable I do not have any issues at all. I‚Äôll end up using the restroom every 5 to 6 hours and not have any awkward feelings.

I‚Äôve recently graduated and I started working a few months ago. I thankfully have a job that allows WFH but I have to go into the office once a week. My office day has a huge impact on my life as my commute to work is around 5 hours in total. This gives me an insane amount of anxiety every week. It has come to the point that I won‚Äôt drink anything the day before and the day itself. Our office day is on Wednesday so I take a few sips on Tuesday when I wake up and then don‚Äôt drink anything until I‚Äôm back home on Wednesday evening. This way I don‚Äôt struggle too much with my bladder but it makes me feel so incredibly miserable.

Outside of work, I‚Äôve ended up completely isolated. The thought of doing anything makes me mortified thinking about my bladder. I‚Äôm not a big drinker anyways but I still avoid drinking ‚Äòa lot‚Äô whenever I know I have to leave the house.

I was wondering if anyone has a similar experience and might be able to help me out? I saw a therapist for a while but I felt like I was getting nowhere because I suck at talking about all of this. I felt guilty for wasting their time as I struggled to make any progress so I stopped going. I‚Äôm ashamed of this whole situation because IRL I don‚Äôt know anyone who struggles with something like this."
155,anxiety in the bedroom ,"I (F21) have been with my boyfriend (M22) for a couple months. We both have extremely high sex drives and have sex frequently.

my boyfriend, that i kinda sorta live with, is getting evicted from his apartment. He‚Äôs has 3 strikes with this complex, one of which is his fault. His previous roommates (who screwed him over) left trash outside, Then they brought home a dog and maintenance found out about it. The only thing that was his fault is he busted a water pipe in the bathroom. that was his last strike. Now that he‚Äôs being evicted, he‚Äôs moving back with his mom and i‚Äôm not necessarily comfortable living with his parents. don‚Äôt get me wrong i want to live with him but something about living with his parents gives me the ick. i like his parents but i can‚Äôt help how i feel. all of this is making me anxious because of the move, the change, the stress, and the money. It‚Äôs going to cost him a lot in the end. He‚Äôs gonna have to pay 3500 for ‚Äúbreaking the lease‚Äù even though he was evicted. I‚Äôm not sure how to handle this situation without having a mental breakdown. our whole worlds are about to change and like i said before, i HATE change. especially when it‚Äôs drastic like this.

157,My anxiety wreaks havoc on my basic social connections,"I have what I believe is a severe type of anxiety. It wreaks havoc on my social connections. Well, let's make it breaf; my whole body shakes uncontrollably in a very embarrassing and humiliating way whenever I'm anxious. It's a nightmare. 

But all my social connections are one thing and this guy I like at uni is another thing. I really wish I could go right to him, shake his hands, talk to him and be a good friend to him. But I can't do as simple a thing as even saying hi to him. He freaks me out. And what freaks me out more is he's aware of my anxious mind. He knows he freaks me out. And I wish I could go right to him without my whole body shaking üò≠ I just can't. And he wouldn't know why I act in this weird way. He would assume I'm weird or just plain rude or unfriendly. And I can't even explain myself. He's been nice to me but in every occasion, I was apparently acting rude because of my anxiety. 
I just look at him, but never dare to go even greet him. And he would make negative assumptions about me. I don't know how to deal with this and my anxiety is just going up instead of down, because I keep telling myself I'm stupid. 

But if I go to him, what am I really gonna say? And what if I shake? Or what if I sweat or stutter? Or blush or seem confused? He'd make negative assumptions about me in either ways. And I've been trying to deal with my anxiety for the past years, and it's not calming down. And I can't deal with it alone. And I asked for help but I wasn't really helped. I feel so down right now. Hope someone shares their opinions with me. "

159,Does eating a lot trigger your anxiety?,"Whenever I overeat and stuff myself I get very anxious. I think it's because when I have an anxiety attack I usually feel nauseous. And I would guess that my brain connects being nauseous or overly full with being anxious now, so it's also going the other way around (not being nauseous from anxiety but being anxious from nausea).

Usually when I take nausea medication the anxiety will get better as well.

160,Help With A Loved One ,"I‚Äôm wondering if anyone can help me, I‚Äôm look for ways to help my partner with her anxiety and my reaction to it when it gets really bad

I guess I‚Äôm asking for help around how we can communicate when the boil over happens and if anyone with servers anxiety has and tips on how to work with it. 

Over the past 4 years is considerably reduced through us doing mindfulness practices and meditation but sometimes (every few weeks) things will start to build up, I can see them coming so I‚Äôm trying to encourage taking some breaths and asking her to try spot the triggers. 

I must admit when things finally boil over I can be calm and help her with kind words but once we get to an hour of going over the same thing I just can‚Äôt take anymore in. I‚Äôm very solution focused and I know that‚Äôs not what she needs all the time but when I see her in pain and stress all I can do is find solutions. We go round and round but nothing changes until I snap. Which lasts for 2 minutes until I calm down. It‚Äôs really stressful on us both and I know we both don‚Äôt mean to hurt each others feelings. 

When the trigger happens, it can relate to something 10 years ago, tomorrow, to 3 years in the future, illnesses, legs cramping up, serious hand twitches, banging her head with her hand. It‚Äôs really scary to see because it switches within a matter of hours. 

Not on medication, tried therapy but says her mind is broken and can never be fixed.

161,What went wrong in my last job?,"I'm gonna tell my story of what happened in my last job and hopefully you guys tell me what I can improve on.

I got hired at this very low end job. Everyday i start by greeting literally everyone at work, even people who i don't know, always had this big fake smile because at work you have to greet every customer and coworker like that (so I thought) But the thing is obviously I'm extremely awkward, shy, introverted and have crippling social anxiety, depression, adhd etc everything to a 1000. And most people can tell that immediately. In work some ppl are genuine and are nice back, some ppl have this ""not this loser again, this is too early in the morning"" look and some give out a quiet sigh.

So this is my 1st mistake, I come off as too desperate, not everyone is an npc and not everyone is obligated to be nice.

Like I mentioned before i have everything on a 1000 and that hinders my work performance, socializing and everything i do, sometimes i pretty much freeze and are left on people's mercy, and some bad apples will try to take advantage of me, some people give out this vibe like ""If this loser can make money working here, than I can hire my own friends and family too"" and try to get my fired. 


2nd mistake, I'm just not assertive or confident enough. And with my lack of experience i come off as being too afraid to make a mistake despite being just as qualified as them.


It's a very low end job so I'm the only white guy there. Most coworkers there are REALLY NICE to you for the first few days because they don't know if you might be someone's friend or maybe you're the boss's nepo hire, but once you come out as an outcast introvert who likes sitting alone at the dinner table to avoid socializing you will get very different looks. 

The type of coworkers there. Old coworkers are usually okay there cuz they've seen it all before. White women have this nonchalant attitude, like they don't care what happens. Black, arab and eatern european guys are hard working and helpful but they will **roast** tf out of you, they aren't that bad, most of my time there was working with them. Black women are usually the most tense to me for some reason, they come off as very moody and desperate, and would blame me first if anything were to go wrong. Latino guys are some of the nicest always. The one asian dude and chick there were okay, but I always felt that Asian ppl get the ick super easily, they always pick up on the awkward cues. Arab and Latino women feels like they try to be extra nice to you cuz they pity you. The one or two fellow socially awkward anxious ppl there made me feel bad.

Then basically I got fired there cuz a blk wm coworker outed me cuz she didn't wanna work the holidays with a rookie, despite telling me she has years of experience herself she wanted to be with someone who would do most of the work so she can chill. I got super depressed hearing all this being said to my face infront of everyone. I'm a **substitute** and dont work there permanently, so only when someone is sick i could come in, I didn't wanna work for a couple of days after feeling depressed, and they fired me after.

3rd mistake ???


My takeaway is you have to earn people's respect and trust by being very competent, dependable and patient, all traits i gotta work on. And despite what some people might say, It's not a just front because I'm awkward or have anxiety I'm genuinely a nice guy and i try to be friendly and nice to everyone all the time, it's just good experience to have for next time."

166,Do you guys call your psychiatrist when your mental health gets bad?,"Might sound dumb but I've only ever reached out for meds and appointments, I see often though that ppl recommend contacting your doctor / mental health professional when it gets to the point where you can't manage your mental health anymore, I've paid the price of never reaching out but I have thought about that advice the few times I've genuinely hit a very low point and was helpless, so I'm curious how many or if any of you have reached out to your doctor and how it went? I have bad social anxiety so it seems impossible for me to imagine how that would go, what the outcome could be, so that's why I chose to ask here for your personal experiences."

168,Anxious about admitting I quit my job,"Hi, so for the fast five months I worked in a warehouse. It wasn't a bad job, the people were nice and company culture was great. But I'd worked manual labor jobs for years, and I think I've outgrown them (that's what my therapist says). Every day I dreaded getting up at 5am to go to work (I'm also not a morning person). I would sometimes find excuses to stay home, or sometimes I would physically feel unwell so I stayed home. I hadn't worked a full five-day work week in at least a month. I was getting in trouble at work for my attendance AND productivity. I would even imagine getting into traffic accidents just to avoid going to work...yeah, it was that bad. I have pretty bad depression and anxiety, and working a job I just didn't enjoy was making my mental health tank so hard. I'm a creative writer and I was trying to use this job as just a way to pay the bills until I got my writing off the ground, but when I came home from work I'd be too physically and mentally exhausted to do anything but lay on the couch most days. 

I explained this to my therapist and she agreed that I needed to find another job. I also told this to my mom, and she agreed. I have a close relationship with her, and I value her opinion on lots of things. She said I shouldn't quit my job until I had another one lined up. A smart piece of advice, and one I tried to follow for about two weeks. But last week...I hit my breaking point. And I went to my manager and explained my situation and she agreed that it was probably better that I resigned (if I didn't then I would probably be fired anyway). I'm glad she was so understanding, and I immediately felt freer and more hopeful about life after leaving, but I worry about how my mom will react. She's very practical and realistic and is the kind of person that can stick it out in crappy situations like this as long as necessary. I've been applying to jobs and I have some money to last me a little bit (maybe a month or two before I really start having trouble) but I'm still anxious that she will disapprove and lecture me and make me feel bad about my decision. I did it for my mental health and to find something better. I want this year to be about creating the life I want. Was I selfish for doing this? How do I go about telling my mom I quit my job? "

I'll see something in the corner of my eye like a blob or weird shape, turn to look and it ending up just being a normal object.

He brought up something political and said he disagreed with it and that the left is always complaining, etc. etc. Now I'm about as far left as you can go but I try and avoid talking politics at all because I hate conflict. I ended up saying I thought the thing he didn't like (basically a trigger warning on something) was useful and a fair thing to have. He gave another reason he didn't like it, I gave another reason I thought it was reasonable. He hasn't responded since and I am panicking.

I know I'm catastrophizing or spiralling or something but I'm now convinced he hates me or I said something terrible and I just don't know what to do. I didn't bring it up and I don't think I said anything bad but what if I did? I'm now trying to message about my dog instead but I feel like I somehow ruined everything."
175,Thinking the worst after swollen lymph nodes,"This may sound stupid, but hear me out. Last week, I was getting in the shower before a midterm, and found a small little bump on my neck.

I went and got a CT, and they said it was my swollen lymph nodes on one side, and that it should go away, but to keep an eye on it. I‚Äôm now freaking out. Every day I can‚Äôt stop thinking that I might get sick, or die. It‚Äôs really tough to stop thinking about, and I‚Äôm just scared because my anxiety will literally prevent me from thinking about anything else. 

Edit: My CT scan revealed only mild inflammation in my lymph nodes, while my thyroid, salivary glands were clear. My lungs were clear. All the doc said was my throat was a little red, but I‚Äôm still freaking out. "
176,Why is it so hard to get anti anxiety medication?,"I‚Äôm 23F. I have no history of addiction, my parents aren‚Äôt addicts. I only smoked marijuana in high school, and after turning 22, I barely drink. I might go to an outing at the bar every other month or so and have 1 or 2 drinks. My anxiety has only gotten worse over time. I started my therapy and medication journey in 2018. Over the course of 6 years, I‚Äôve been on prozac, lexapro, zoloft, wellbutrin, buspar, and hydroxyzine. Some did not help, others just never got me to where I wanted to be and only temporarily helped. I‚Äôve also been on and off with medications(like on medication for 6-10 months and then wean off and stop taking anything for awhile), and have had multiple therapists and psychiatrists. I know you can‚Äôt be prescribed heavier stuff over the phone, so I finally found an in person psychiatrist I was able to see in just a couple weeks. I was 2 mins from my appointment when I get a call that he‚Äôs sick and can‚Äôt come in. So I went into the office anyway and used their iPad to do a video visit. He wants to put me on Effexor. I told him my anxiety is SO bad that I‚Äôm barely able to drive without freaking out, I can‚Äôt go grocery shopping alone anymore, I‚Äôve been out of work since December because of how bad it is. I feel dizzy and like I‚Äôm going to pass out any time I go into public. It‚Äôs ruining my life. He said I have MDD, GAD, and Panic disorder. And that Effexor and therapy will help. Why are doctors so against prescribing heavier things, even at low doses? I feel like none of these SSRI‚Äôs and SNRI‚Äôs are doing anything and I feel like there‚Äôs no hope of me ever getting better. And for those of you who are/have been on Effexor for anxiety with similar symptoms of mine, has it helped?"
177,Coping Advice Needed For Social Event,"Looking for some advice. I‚Äôve had some trouble lately with panic, nausea, sudden loss of appetite, dizziness, etc. when going out to eat at a restaurant. I have a social event with my wife and some friends tomorrow evening that I‚Äôm feeling a little nervous for. I have been listening to the Dare podcast and have found some of that advice helpful but looking for some more pointers on how to have a better time and enjoy the dinner rather than freaking out and having to leave early. Any tips?

178,I have a fear of losing my testicles,"Hello. I have a big fear and a lot of intrusive thoughts about losing my balls, i always think someones gonna cut them off, i know its dumb but it really scares me.

What do i do? Does anyone also have this irrational fear? How to get rid of it?"
179,"Has anyone been able to ""get off meds""? How do I know if I actually have issues or I'm just experiencing withdraw symptoms?","TLDR: I don't even know if I actually HAVE anxiety/ depression, or if it's mostly withdraw symptoms. I have impending doom feelings/ crying that I never had before. Functioning has been really difficult.  I don't know if I want to start medication again.  Has anyone been able to get off meds?  Are there other things that have helped you?

For some background, I was prescribed Zoloft by a pcp when I was a teenager. I've been on various SSRIs for literally 20 years. I've never been to any kind of specialist or therapy, just pcps that keep filling the prescription. I just really don't know if I ""need"" meds, or want to be dependent on them the rest of my life. I've tried stopping a few times, but never got past the initial withdraw.  
  
I've been on celexa the longest and most recently. I stopped taking it in September, so, 5 months ago. Some days I feel like I'm fine, but generally it's been a ROUGH 5 months. I had the initial horrible withdrawal (... brain zaps, dizziness, anger outbursts, pain in my body, headaches, terrible RLS for about a month. Because I did not taper )  
  
ETA: during this time, I also found out I have very low iron levels. This can mimic depression. I have diabetes. I'm often fatigued. I've also had issues with iron supplements causing me physical (and maybe mental) issues. I'm so confused about what is a symptom of what.  
  
It's like, ""what came first... the chicken or the egg?""  
  
Right now, I feel like I'm turning into a different person. I feel consumed by emotions. I have anxiety that I never had before. Impending doom when I wake up, fear without any stimulus, crying over anything or nothing at all. I have a pleasant life, a good job, I don't have trauma. But I feel like crap about every other day. I can't help others and I'm always upset about how bad I feel. It is difficult to do my job or enjoy anything.  I've called off work because I panic in the morning.  
  
From what I've been reading, ""withdrawl"" lasts for a very long time. Most people go back on meds when they think they are relapsing, but its all still a form of withdrawal.  
  
How do I know if I'm actually depressed/ having anxiety, or if I'm having withdrawal symptoms?

 Am I just going to have to take meds for the rest of my life to feel normal?  
  
If you stopped ssris, what did that look like for you? 

How long until you started to feel normal? 

Did you take/ do something else? 

What helped?"
180,Recently visited ER for anxiety.. NP suggested psychiatrist and having trouble finding one,"I'm having a very difficult time finding a psychiatrist. My anxiety has been getting way worse and it's starting to take a toll on me. I found one across the road that was in network and took my insurance and they said it would be $400-$500 just for the first appointment. Does anyone use online therapy or online psychiatry that they recommend? I have Anthem insurance and I'm fine paying but I really need help looking for more affordable options, and virtual would be best for me."
181,Anxiety taking control of my life. Just started escitalopram and have been on propranolol.,"Hello peeps.

I am 28 years of age, almost 29, and just for the first time in my life I have been experiencing anxiety. Before starting my life story just wanted to say that I appreciate any positive feedback, outlets, or your personal experience with anxiety. It‚Äôs nice to know we aren‚Äôt alone and can work through these obstacles together.

Last year I had my first panic attack, at work, out of nowhere‚Ä¶ not knowing what was going on or what to do. I thought I was having a heart attack‚Ä¶ sweating profusely, arm/face tingling, fight or flight adrenaline, heart pounding through my chest. I tried leaving and going home but my boss wouldn‚Äôt let me drive. He had the nurse on site check my blood pressure. The nurse told me I needed to go to urgent care or the ER‚Ä¶ which freaked me out even more. Fast forward it was just a panic attack, they prescribed me hydroxyzine and I took the next few days off work. 

After this I had in and out minor panic attacks that eventually went away. (By the way I forgot to mention i was a heavy drinker, smoker, tobacco user, lots of caffeine, no exercise, stressful job, and never got a lot of sleep) I turned my life around by changing all the lifestyle choices I mentioned above by going sober. After everything went back to normal‚Ä¶ I started drinking and smoking again, which lead to lack of sleep, no exercising, and constant stress at work. My anxiety came back, but this time it was different‚Ä¶ more intense, more often, and to the point I was calling out of work for weeks.

Doctor started me on busprione (they always tried to give me SSRIs but I was against it everytime). Busprione took a bit to kick in and was awesome for a week‚Ä¶ then I started getting the worst headaches of my life. This itself started my anxiety again even through the buspirone. Messaged my doc and she said to see if the headaches go away and check in later during the week. Headaches wouldn‚Äôt stop and I started to taper off the busprione. In the meantime she prescribed me propranolol. This helped so much with my blood pressure, headaches, and a little bit with anxiety. Long story short‚Ä¶ the propranolol wasn‚Äôt enough so I saw a doc again for anxiety and they started me on escitalopram (brand lexipro). I am on day 4 and tbh it has been changing my life for the better. I do a lot of public speaking at work, and I can finally do that again without a panic attack in my head. I am starting to go back to work and feel like I can live my life. I hope it keeps getting better though, but for a day 4 I can tell a difference.

Side note: all this kinda stems from my fear of that initial attack and also thinking something is wrong with my heart or cardiovascular system. My family has a lot of heart issues. I saw a heart specialist and we‚Äôre doing test just to see. 

Thanks for listening to me. If anyone has anything that has helped them or similar experiences I‚Äôd love to hear. Thx.

182,Heart palpitations and thumps ,"Trigger Warning

Been having weird heart palpitations and fluttering for the past 4 days. I‚Äôve had palpitations before, but never like this. It‚Äôs like almost constant with my heart making one loud thump in between a few beats. Hard enough I can feel it in my throat. Went and got blood work today and my Dr listened to my heart and he said it sounded good. No chest pains btw. Just very uncomfortable and freaking me out. 

I feel like I‚Äôm going crazy. Anyone else experience anything like this?"
183,Noticed a pattern,"I noticed that my social anxiety appear in form of bursts especially in the beginning of any outing.
At first it would be severe to debilitating that makes me so discouraged to stay present so i usually would give up and go home. This pattern has been going on for as long as i can remember and the despair that comes from it is just too much to handle. Today instead of leaving home early as usual i hung up a bit more than my usual and noticed a big difference in my anxiety level. The awkwardness is less and although i may also be struggling but not as much as the beginning.


This a reminder from me to myself to hang up a bit longer,anxiety will get less,set a 30 mins timer and see the change for yourself. And most importantly have some compassion.

184,Health Anxiety and elevated heart rate ,"I struggle with anxiety mostly related to my health. Anytime i am sick or something is off with my body I automatically go into panic mode and think the worst possible thing will happen. I have a cold and last night I had a fever which caused me to have a full on anxiety attack my heart rate went all the way up to 160 and stayed high for most of the night cause I couldn‚Äôt stop checking it and freaking out every time it didn‚Äôt go down. I know being sick usually increases your heart right but I still couldn‚Äôt shake it off. I went to the ER last week for stomach pains and I of course thought there was something really wrong with me they did a CT scan and everything came back normal. The doctor said probably just some gas. I‚Äôve also had blood work done and other than me being anemic everything else is normal. 
 Does anyone else struggle with this? Any tips to help with this? I know my fears can be irrational but it‚Äôs so hard to reel back in when I‚Äôm already in that state of nervousness. "

186,can severe anxiety make you go insane?,"hi! i'm 26f and my boyfriend who had schizoaffective committed suicide three months ago. i was experiencing severe depression the first two months, then suddenly out of no where one day, i had a severe panic attack that lasted the entire afternoon. i went to urgent care for it.

since then, which it's been about 3ish weeks, i have had crippling anxiety every single day. i wake up anxious, i go to bed anxious. there are a few parts of my day where i don't feel so bad and can quiet my mind, but it's usually when i'm distracted. my brain is foggy and my vision is blurry a lot. i know that i'm rooted in reality and have not experienced anything other than intense anxiety. sometimes, when a panic attack is coming on, i feel scared that i'm going insane. i'm scared i'm losing my grip and won't come out of it.

i don't know if this is fear from seeing my boyfriend enter and exit psychosis so often that now i'm afraid i'm experiencing it. i'm just really scared all the time.

i'm seeing a therapist and got lexapro, hydroxyzine, and xanax but i'm too scared to take any of it.


is this ever going to end? i just want to be normal and not have to constantly fight the anxiety. "

No specific area, just a flowing mild dull pain that ebbs and flows around the body. Anyone else get this? It's mild but alarming. Not treatable with pain relief medication. My guess is over stress phantom pains that go away with the stress and anxiety. Who else experiences these? It really triggers my health anxiety as i am afraid it could be something worse like fibromyalgia or another chronic pain disorder. "

190,Strange Anxiety Triggers,"I'm curious as to why certain innocuous things trigger my anxiety. 

I was studying for my drivers license today, and the course I'm taking provided a video. It was a typical old one with bad audio and overly enthusiastic dialogue. In it, a girl and her driving instructor were sitting in a car talking about safe driving. 

There wasn't anything outright unsettling about it, and I dont believe its a fear of driving, since it tends to happen with videos of different topics yet similar styles; so I'm wondering why I experienced such an intense spike in anxiety while watching?

Becoming dizzy, having this TV-Static kind of vision when standing up and so on, weird sensations on my forehead and also between my eyebrows, which I hate, eye floaters and so on. Today I was doing a skiing tour (like, walking up the mountain on your skis, then going down again) - and afterwards I felt like I couldn't breathe in anymore. Is this anxiety induced?

I've been subsisting on Soylent and occasionally cereal or some peanut butter when I can stomach it but I've been eating < 1000 calories a day.

I have Gad but this worsened period of anxiety has been going on for over nearly two months now and i have gone down 5 kg and am now weighing 46 kg. This is because even eating is seen as a threat by my brain. 

I used to be on 20 mg of escitalopram for 4 years which helped a lot but it stopped having the same effect so i was switched over to trintellix for a month which made my anxiety even worse. Now I‚Äôm currently on 25 mg sertraline for 3 days and feeling awful.

197,I can't shake off the anxiety for my drive tomorrow ,"Hello. I'm female, 30, in therapy for a little over 5 years, on Zoloft for a year and a half for anxiety and depression. Mostly due to childhood stuff. My mom also has severe anxiety and her own trauma plus some narcissitc tendencies sprinkled on top. 

Tomorrow is my 31st birthday. I'm going to drive home some 200 km. I'm struggling to shake off the anxiety for the drive. 
As a preamble - when I was a child mom never allowed me on school trips that involved any kind of busses or cars deeming them unsafe. She didn't want me driving on the highway until I had a year of driving under my belt. She threw a fit when my uncle let me drive his little electric car. She said it was unsafe. 
Last week mom told me she's been feeling terrible dread and the feeling of some impending doom. She put on a nice smiley face when dad was around then refused to elaborate. My lovely anxiety ridden brain found the intrusive thought that follows: ""You're gonna crash and die on your birthday, of course you won't see your loved ones again and you'll never get married."" 
I've been having difficulties shaking this off, and every time the traffic is hectic my brain goes in a lovely low key spiral. 

I filled up the gas, I cleaned the car, I pumped air in the tire, there's no alarms no nothing. 

I just wish to kick this anxiety 

And I recently tried stepping down the Zoloft, go for a lower dose but the anxiety got way worse so I had to go back. 

This is so frustrating"

At 18 and from there idk I just don‚Äôt know who I am anymore I lash out I hurt people purposely because I feel shitty . And I‚Äôm tired of feeling this way .

Like in these specific situations i much rather run into a busy traffic than go out.

Even my hobbies fail to hold my interest for more than 10 minutes at a time, it's all just soooo boring!  I'm all alone with nobody to talk to, and stuck inside my head for the duration.  

It's frustrating.  I have nothing to actually worry about, and that in part is what is causing my worry.  I wake up in the morning feeling like I'm serving another day of a prison sentence.  I'm not really looking for advice on what I can do to kill time/anxiety; go for a walk, read a book, do a puzzle, whatever.  I know, it's not that simple.

I recently had an upper respiratory virus and was prescribed fluticasone (Flonase) nasal spray to help ease congestion. I took 2 doses as prescribed the 1st day and one dose the following day and by evening on the second day I was experiencing extreme panic and anxiety. Generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and depression are all part of my mental health history however I was relatively stable and had not had a panic attack in about 2 months until taking the Flonase.

It‚Äôs now been 3.5 days since the last dose of Flonase and although I don‚Äôt feel as stable as before using it, I do think I‚Äôm improving each day.

207,Anxiety about cleaning ,"Hi! 

I need to preface this is not linked to how dirty the house is. I feel the same amount of anxiety around starting a task if there is one or a hundred tasks to do. 

I get paralysing dread around cleaning the house. I cannot seem to start the task at all. Sometimes it is simply necessary to clean the house as a task. I can clean a toilet after I use it. Make the bed when I get up but when I need to set time aside to clean I get so anxious. In my life I can't keep the house clean by doing these jobs as asides to the rest of my life. I work 60-70 hr weeks, 14 hr shifts. I need to spend time on my days off cleaning. But when it becomes this structured thing I get so anxious. 

I don't deal with anxiety often, and I'm not unsure of how to do these tasks. I can write a to do list, I can plan my day but I simply cannot start. No amount of prep or lack of prep seems to work when I simply /need/ to do a chore. 

Does anyone have any advice??"
208,Living Alone with Anxiety,"After living with my mother and sister for a few months following an incredibly intense period of anxiety triggered by a few massive panic attacks in the Fall, I have moved into my own place. While I am able to recognize on an intellectual level that, in my current state, this represents an accomplishment, I have never felt more anxious.

I know it‚Äôs unhealthy, but I often rely on reassurance from others to get through my panic attacks. There are times when I am so dizzy, and so cold, and so shaky and nauseous and terrified that I am absolutely SURE something is physically wrong. Not having anybody to reassure me that I‚Äôm okay has sent me into an emotional tailspin, and I‚Äôm not sure how I‚Äôm going to stabilize here.

Right now, my heart is racing and I feel the sense of dread which, for me, typically presents as the beginning of a panic attack. I feel alone, afraid and on the verge of a health crisis of some kind.

Before my lunch break I was taken on a backstage tour of the theatre. They took me up to this platform above the stage. It was pretty open and we stood up there and spoke for about ten minutes. When I was up there I felt so anxious like I was going to fall over the railings down onto the stage.

213,How to stop anxiety morning sickness before work?,"Hi everyone,

Don't usually post here, or anywhere tbh, but this has been bothering me for years now and I could do with some answers/help.

(26M) For the last few years, I've been waking almost every morning feeling sick and wanting to dry heave, sometimes actually resulting in being sick. This has caused me to have a few days where I'm just like ""nope"" and called in sick to work, which always made me feel guilty  as I always felt like I wasn't ""properly sick"" so I didn't deserve it off. But my job revolves around alot of driving and not exactly the sort of job I can just nip up to the toilet if I'm feeling crap again.

Yesterday and today are another one of those days. Nothing has happened at work that's making me anxious but I think it's just general anxiety panicking for the day as my job is somewhat stressful and that.

I'm just wondering if anyone else has or has had this issue? It's affecting my life quite a bit now and I don't know what to do.

Any help is appreciated, thank you."

I have been struggling from anxiety since I was a kid, but for the past four years, my anxiety has become more severe. I experience some physical symptoms, and I am not sure if the symptoms are because of my anxiety. The symptoms include constant head rushes. I get head rushes, especially when I stand up from a sitting position, and when I do activities that require some physical dedication . I also experienced very fast heartbeat. I feel breathless, almost all the time, and especially when I do some things that requires some physical activity but also when I‚Äôm staying, I feel the need to 
take a deep breath. I also sometimes feel like something is stuck in my throat. I feel like I‚Äôm ‚Äòblocked‚Äô. when I experience head, rushes I also experience and hear a wooshing sound in my right ear. And a symptom that I have been experiencing a lot lately is fatigue.

215,Breakup left me shattered,"Short version my girlfriend (21f) broke up with me (21m). We had a great relationship, she said I have treated her the best out of anybody else she‚Äôs been with, she said she dreamt of walking down the aisle to me. I thought everything was going well. Then she pulled the plug out of nowhere because she didn‚Äôt want to talk about what was bothering her. She lied to me several times during the breakup and then told me the truth later on. After we broke up I had a moment of weakness and cut myself for the first time in 2 years. We got back together and talked about it, she agreed she should have talked about what was bothering her first. She then saw my cuts (I tried to hide them bc I was ashamed) and she then broke up with me again. She said she can‚Äôt handle that. We talked more after a couple days and decided to just take a month or more to work on ourselves and then reconvene and see if we want to try again. We both cared for each other. Roughly a week ago she came to me and showed me that she cut herself, she cut a lot. I didn‚Äôt give up on her and took care of her. She then stopped responding to me and it really scared me. Three days ago she called and said she wants me to move on. 

She said she has a lot going on in her life, she said her alcoholic dad started drinking again. She said she might get kicked out of college because they think she cheated on tests. She said she lost some friends because they confessed their feelings for her. She said she lost some other friends because they were spreading lies about her. 

Two days ago she called again and said she really wants me to move on. She said she is thinking of being a nun, and that she will never marry a non catholic man (I‚Äôm Christian, we didn‚Äôt talk about it but I would have consider becoming catholic). She has put me through a lot, I‚Äôm about 95% sure I never want to see her again but 5% of me still misses her. 

My mother thinks she is a narcissist and thinks that she makes nothing her fault. All of my friends think I dodged a big bullet. All I really know is that she hurt me a lot and put me through a lot.

I have noticed my anxiety has gotten a lot worse. I have gotten roughly 3 panic attacks a day (normally <1 a month for me). I‚Äôm guessing I‚Äôm more anxious because I was so blind sided but I‚Äôm not sure. I am trying therapy in a couple days (earliest I can get in). Does anybody have any advice that could help me before therapy, everything is difficult. I only feel sick, numb, sad, or hollow. My normal hobbies don‚Äôt seem interesting and I‚Äôm not sure what to do. Thank you in advance for any advice."

This has extended to my long time girlfriend of 3 years now, where I act very different with her and feel uncomfortable being with her around both my friends and family.

This even happens within friends, where I‚Äôll make a new friend, but then keep them very separate from my other friends as I fear they won‚Äôt get along and make them think less of me for some reason. 


The thing is, I don‚Äôt know if I concisely am trying to put on an act. I feel internally like the people I am around simply draw out very different aspects of my personality, and I have different priorities and perceptions of how to communicate around each other.

Little bit background of myself : I have been recently diagnosed with anxiety, and been having horrible anxiety attacks in past 1 month. Worst part is along with anxiety I'm also facing really bad f***ed up tmj right now. So mental plus physical illnesses have teamed up together to f**k up my life. Everyday I observe new type of symptom in body. THE REAL POINT IS I CAN'T BE RUNNING TO DR EVERY F***KING DAY BECAUSE MY BRAIN THINKS I'M HAVING HEART ATTACK OVER SOME RANDOM STUPID ITCH ON MY CHEST.  LIKE HOW DO I DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN REAL AND ANXIETY. ""NOT ALWAYS WE HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO JUST SIT AND F**KING FIGURE OUT IF I'M ACTUALLY DYING OR IT'S JUST DUMB A** ANXIETY ACTING UP.

I said they were stuck up to them. However , I like one of the girls but I said they were stuck up because the other girl had an argument with my friend so I was just sticking up for her. 
Now I‚Äôm sober it‚Äôs playing on my mind because one of them is my friend and it looked like I was calling them both stuck up plus usually I never say anything bad about anyone but I said it in front of them all and there will be crossed wires about it. Because of my OCD this stuff plays on my mind and I have to take action to try and get validation and make myself feel better. So today , after 5 days I messaged both of the guys and said ‚Äú on Saturday I didn‚Äôt mean both of the girls were stuck up I just said it meaning one of them because she had an argument with my friend ‚Äú and now it‚Äôs made me feel even worse because they replied saying they didn‚Äôt even remember and why am I saying this now and getting worried over it. So now I am embarrassed and it‚Äôs made my thoughts even worse than before I said something because they didn‚Äôt remember anyway and now I‚Äôve reminded them!

I was wondering if anyone had any experience with this drug and could give me some insight into whether I should continue counseling like I have without the drug for the most part or if I should take the drug daily and do counseling.

Well 8 months ago I suffered a concussion that triggered panic attacks and anxiety (along with a bunch of other concussion symptoms). Now I'm concussion symptom free but still have increased anxiety. Panic attacks now are more mental and a bit of an adrenaline rush. Also I know when I'm anxious because I just feel ""weird"" and ""off"". They seem to come in waves and seem random. 

Im doing CBT, learning to not fight the anxiety, and accept this new feeling. I have tried Zoloft for two months and that was awful for me. So I rather be med free. I feel the old me is in there slowly coming back but it's so defeating when the wave of anxiety hits.

Things have improved but slowly. I guess my question is, has anything helped you overcome anxiety? Experience anything like this? Did you return to your old self? (I also recognize asking this and looking for reinsurance probably isn't helpful lol) "

Hello guys. Been struggling with anxiety for 3 years now

When it started I couldn‚Äôt even go for a walk cause I thought I‚Äôd have a heart attack

3 years later I‚Äôm running 10-15 kilometres per run 

So today was running day, I started feeling not very strong. My mind started doubting that I‚Äôd be able to finish. And when my mind gives up my body starts to shut down and bad thoughts come in. It had happened before 3-4 months ago in one of my runs. I started feeling dizzy and thought I was going to have a heart attack ( I was having a small panic attack). This lasted for like 30 seconds. I stopped for a minute to get my shit together and then started again 

This time, I didn‚Äôt stop and just kept going because I knew that my mind was playing games again. I just let the thoughts be and I relaxed. It was uncomfortable but I did it

So I‚Äôm a bit confused,on the one side I feel proud that I didn‚Äôt give in and stop. I handled it like a boss. But on the other hand I‚Äôm little bit disappointed that I let these thoughts get in my head in the first place,cause I haven‚Äôt had one of these episodes in my runs for 3-4 months now

245,making and keeping friends :/,"hey guys

this is random but been thinking about this soooo much today.

i have soooo much trouble maintaining friendships and making new friends. like i know i'm not special with this problem but thinking deeper about it, i've kinda articulated what it is i do that ruins them for me.

does anyone else avoid messaging new people/new friends? i even find myself putting off messages from my long-time few friends. i'm trying to understand why i do this. it has to be more than anxiety? it's to the point people give up on me (understandable) and think i lack crucial communication skills (which is fair.) the thing is i communicate very well when in person with people i'm comfortable with and know quite well, but as for new friends or potential people i see and think 'oh yeah we would make good friends' i shut off, become extremely awkward, and come across either like i'm not all there or i don't care for them and want to be left alone.

i'm hoping to change these habits and become better at this. it's easy to sit and think 'just reply. just say something. what the fuck is wrong with you?' but i find long term (or even short term for that matter) it does nothing to help my situation.

i find myself at 25, STILL struggling as i did in my teens, to create friendships and be a permanent part of others lives. the 2 friends i have put up with me because i've had them for several years, and i made them in the small window in my life where i was social (and drinking a lot of alcohol which helps me be way more open and social.) they understand how i am and know not to take it personally when i don't reply for hours or days (which i am so lucky to have) but one of them doesn't live anywhere near me and the other is extremely social so i have no time to see her. 

i'll also add that messaging them doesn't feel as much of a chore as messaging people i don't know extremely well and deeply. if i have met you 10 times it's still not enough, i will not reply to your message for days.

sorry for the ramble, i'm hoping somehow this resonates with some of you out there and if you maybe have advice for me, or if you kinda get what i'm saying and do the same as me, and we can discuss so i don't feel so alone.

thanks for listening <3"
246,Rant/Vent,"Hey everybody I just feel like ranting and also asking how y‚Äôall deal with those symptoms. 
So I Never really had anxiety in that way, I was always socially anxious which got better with time, but since 2021 it all turned so bad. 
I‚Äôm an optimist and usually quite enjoy life and take every challenge as it comes, always looking for the good thing. But with this.. legit it makes life unbearable sometimes. I feel like I‚Äôm not even existing, I‚Äôm in constant surviving mode trying to breathe and come trough night and day. And also I feel like most people don‚Äôt really get what I‚Äôm going through. I struggle with breathing sometimes everyday, having air hunger and chest pain. My arm or hand going numb, dizziness. Insomnia. It‚Äôs like I never get a pause. It‚Äôs always kind of there. Someday just like really strong. 
In 2023 I started therapy and i guess it got a bit better. I assume I only had like real bad anxiety when there was a full moon coming or idk some special event. But then to the end of 2023 life was extremely exhausting and since then I struggle again more frequently. I figured that my anxiety goes up when I drink alcohol so right now I‚Äôm not drinking and checking if it changes something, but since I quit smoking weed in 2022 this is my only escape out of reality. And no I don‚Äôt drink often but from time to time it was quite regularly to put my mind at ease and just bc everything makes more fun with it Idk.. nice distraction. Sorry if this is a little all over the place, imma just bomb y‚Äôall with all my thoughts. 
I can‚Äôt sleep without hearing music or a movie in the background. The last nights I even struggle so badly that I dream from been very anxious and breathing really uncomfortably and then waking up doing so. Calming down just seems impossible. Literally I tried so many things even got medicine. It won‚Äôt help. But everybody expects me to function. And ‚Äûfunctioning‚Äú is really hard and exhausting for me.

247,Graduate admission guilt,"I am applying to an Ivy League which is obviously out of my league. I still wanted to try but when I saw my lecturer sent the LOR I was hit with a sudden wave of guilt. Like why would he send or write a LOR for someone like me? like I have nothing to offer or bring to the table. I can feel my innards churn and dishevel in absolute cringe. I fear what they are thinking. Im sure they are like why is she even bothering She is so average anyway. I feel like throwing up and screaming into the void but my voice is stuck in my throat. I don't wanna say it but my chances of getting in are so low as well. I want to stay optimistic and believe in that ray of hope, but realistically idk. maybe ill just apologise to my lecturer for not living up to their expectation."

I was prescribed sertraline and propranolol about a month ago, and never really started sertraline as I don‚Äôt believe I need it to help with my anxiety. However I have been taking the propranolol as needed, as prescribed, to help with my physical anxiety symptoms. Including the constant watch over my heart and how fast/ slow it‚Äôs beating, palpitations, skipped beats etc. it was really consuming. However, recently I broke up with my girlfriend and when I go to sleep I get these insane rushes of adrenaline that jolt me up the second I fall asleep. And when I wake up, before I move or get up, it feels like I‚Äôm about to have a full blown panic attack. Like the heart rate feels +100, can feel my face warming up, the whole works. But the second I get up it all goes away and I feel fine again. Then I‚Äôll try and sleep again after trying to shake the feeling off, and the second I start to fall asleep it happens all over again and I wake up with a racing heart. Anyone know what to do? This is exhausting and interfering with my work. "
251,New to anxiety,"Hello! I‚Äôm pretty new to this whole anxiety thing. I‚Äôm a 24 year old male. I just started getting anxiety like a week and a half ago. I‚Äôve gone to a doctor and psychologist, since then I haven‚Äôt had a panic attack (thank god). But I still have concerns.

I guess my question is, is it normal to feel left arm pain (specifically in the armpit region) after having constant episodes? I know it sounds weird but ever since the anxiety started I‚Äôve had this pain. 

I‚Äôm just curious if I should be worried‚Ä¶ I would love to hear about your experiences. I don‚Äôt really like doctors as I feel they only care bout the money. And honestly I‚Äôm scared. I feel like it‚Äôs a heart problem but my doctor checked my pulse and listened to my heart says it‚Äôs fine. Spoke with my mother about it and she thinks I pulled something.

252,Sudden onset and persistence of symptoms?,"Hey! I have someone very close to me who is experiencing very intense persistent anxiety and insomnia that came out quite suddenly and strongly, without any prior history of mental illness. During nights and days he feels deep hopeless, evenings are better. He is 32 years old. He did break up with a partner around the time the insomnia started (5 months ago) but says that this would be way too strong of a reaction to it. Is it normal that something like this starts so suddenly and strongly and to be so persistent to someone with no previous background? Did your anxiety 'start' suddenly or without a clear reason? Also, how can I make him feel better and more hopeful about healing? Right now he says he feels like he'll never get better. Thank you for your help!

It's kind if happened in the past but I got over it that time. The past couple days I've been super focused on my heartbeat and somehow I think it feels different(?) than before. My family says I'm psyching my self out, as I am 18M and I don't think my family has a history with heart stuff. For some reason I can't convince myself that they are right."
254,I can‚Äôt stop talking,"Hi everyone! I‚Äôve been diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder since I was a young 20 something in college and since then, I keep getting diagnosed with this, twice after the first. I‚Äôm sure there are underlying issues with me, it‚Äôs just too much trouble right now to find help from Kaiser Permanente. Their mental health team is godawful. Had my psychiatrist and therapist dump me after a year of them not remembering important facts about me. Like my name.

My job right now requires me to talk a lot. It‚Äôs great I do love it, something about talking sparks energy into me. I get so excited I have to talk and go on tangents when it gets slow. Unfortunately I over share and I have a difficult time lying. I can‚Äôt stop myself and what‚Äôs worse, my coworkers encourage it. They egg me on probably because they‚Äôre bored, or they‚Äôre doing it to make fun of what I said after. I hope not but sometimes I see their eyes shift towards each other and I only notice it later, during my afternoon commute. My GAD does cause paranoia so I doubt myself sometimes but still.

There was also a coworker two years ago who complained to my boss and HR that I was too much (yet he would engage with me). That I was childish. One day he had his phone out facing up and while he asked me for help, I accidentally read his text making fun of me ‚Äúomg another pointless conversation.‚Äù and I knew it was about me. And there were other moments too, straight up being two faced. This man broke me inside and out. After two years, even after he left, I don‚Äôt seem to get better, even with new colleagues I just have to talk and talk.

My bitter feelings about where I work, our shit pay, the betrayal I felt about management screwing us over during the pandemic keeps surfacing more and more. I know eventually I will get into more trouble so I‚Äôm trying to find a new job or career. Like it sounds crazy but I desperately want to move to another state just to leave myself behind and become a quieter person. I want to be that person so badly just not knowing anyone, where I can‚Äôt bother them.

I hope someone relates, I know it sounds crazy but it‚Äôs true. Would it help me to get diagnosed with something that‚Äôs not GAD? Is there a technique I can do to keep me from over sharing? Well if someone relates, I hope you‚Äôre okay.

258,Anxiety/panic over work. Can you snap back to being 'normal',"Okay, semi long read incoming. Also not English native speaker

I used to work as a middle manager for about 5 years up until 2023. In my 5th year, I started to lose control over some parts of my job, causing a panic attack that lead into some kind of burn out. I was pretty unhappy there anyway, so I quit. I had 6 months off and then got asked for a comparable job at another office.  I first wanted to say no, but I figured it couldn't hurt to just try it. 4 months in and I am feeling the same panic/anxiety as I felt before.

Now to be clear, I visited a psychologist for this in 2023. I had about 10 sessions and the conclusion was that I was gifted, which
made a lot of sense after reading into it. I mostly struggle hard when I have responsibility over stuff I cannot fully control. I also struggle hard when things don't have a head and a tail. I need to finish things, not work in a continuous loop. 

I quit my job once again cause I started to feel the same panic as last year. I'm okay-ish, but on edge of a panic attack, nervous and extremely disappointed in myself. My plan for now is to get some rest and get a simple job (as in, no pressure, no real responsibilities). I know where my panic/anxiety comes from and I hope that avoiding those situations will help me a lot.

I wonder what your experiences are when you got away from the environment that leads to panic attacks and anxiety? Did you feel like your old self quickly? Was it like you 'snapped out of the anxiety '?

259,Anxiety and Vomiting,"my name is Lillie and im 17 and I would really like to hear opinions from other people about my problem.
Just for information, I've been diagnosed with anxiety when I was 8 and I have received therapy before. 
Last September I formed a romantic connection with a guy (it didn't last btw lol) but during that time I found myself feeling so anxious to the point where I was vomiting EVERY SINGLE DAY for two weeks straight in the morning as soon as I woke up. This was so damaging to me and my health, I lost a lot of weight too. He ended up ghosting me anyway and the vomiting went away but I did get put on Phenergan (anti vomiting meds) but this didn't help and they changed it to Cyclizine.

fast forward a month or so and I'm talking to a new guy but I've known him for like 2 years, he lives not far and we met up. We smoked weed and I ended up greening out and throwing up a lot but apart from that my anxiety wasn't so bad. He comes back the next day to see me and my anxiety is awful again, we watch a movie and I threw up 5-6 times (in like 15 minutes intervals) throughout the movie. 
a week or so later I meet up with him and we are in a shopping centre and I throw up on myself in public and it was so embarrassing, I didn't know my way around anywhere and couldn't find a toilet. he was really nice to me and understanding but we also stopped talking.

this is the third time now, I've been really interested in this guy since January and we both like eachother, we meet up every Thursday with our friends and my anxiety has been ok and I haven't thrown up but the past few days it's coming back, I'm waking up with horrible anxiety and I'm struggling a lot to take public transport too, I stopped taking Cyclizine a few months ago but have gone back to taking it as I'm so scared to be sick. I really think I need to go on anxiety medication, does anyone else experience the same thing as me? "
260,Copper IUD making my anxiety worse?,"Hi all
I've had my copper IUD inserted a bit over a month ago. Before that, I had finished CBT therapy and finally felt that my anxiety was under control (as in I'd still get anxious, but I now had the tools to acknowledge how I was feeling and dealing with it).
Since getting my IUD, apart from other side effects such as abdominal pain, severe bloating, etc. I feel that my anxiety has gone so much worse, the techniques I learned in therapy no longer suffice and the shortness of breath and chest pains are back. I tried explaining this to my GP who said I was probably overreacting and needed to let my body adjust to the IUD for a few months before feeling like ""myself"" again. 

Did this happen to any of you, and if so did it get better? I can't really see myself dealing with this anxiety peak again for months hoping that my body adjust to it :("
261,"When it comes to agoraphobia..,","‚ÄúDo the thing you fear, and the death of fear is certain.‚Äù
‚Äì Ralph Waldo Emerson

Take tiny, tiny baby steps very frequently. Start a few days before going out by lying down, getting totally relaxed and then  imagining that you are facing your fear. As soon as you are feeling anxious imagining this,  imagine you are out of that situation and get totally relaxed again. Once you are sure you relax, try it again. Try not to overthink or  analyze this. Each time you are sure you are totally relaxed put the tips of your thumb, index and middle finger together. Repeat several times a day. Once you are ready to do this for real, put your fingers together like this and your mind will automatically be trained to relax. You‚Äôve inadvertently trained your mind to get anxious in certain settings, here you are using that characteristic of your mind to your advantage. However, don‚Äôt get too wrapped up in being relaxed. The way out of this is not by frantically looking to be relaxed, it‚Äôs changing how you view this. Think long term. Even if it bothers you when you are anxious, be willing to endure these tests the rest of the time and rewrite the narrative. ‚ÄúSay, no it wasn‚Äôt that bad, I can take it‚Äù and be prepared to do it again and take that plunge anyway. Say, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have to like it. I don‚Äôt really need to avoid it, it‚Äôs just unpleasant if I do avoid it, but I really shouldn‚Äôt.  I can take it.‚Äù"
262,Jealous of those who know how to control their anxiety/don't have any.,"I work in a kitchen, a very busy kitchen, and it drives me crazy. I am in panic/anxiety mode 24/7/365. Not just as work, but always, everywhere. And I'm jealous as I look at my coworkers just chilling at their lines. Even during the busiest time if the night, their just chill and going with the flow.

But I'm freaking out constantly, always worried something's going to happen. Even hearing the ticket machine go off sends me into anxiety mode. Even at home, all I do is panic and freak out and cry, it constantly feels like my world is collapsing in on me and there's nothing to stop it... but everyone else I know is just chilling their way through life. ""This is cool"", ""That's cool"", ""just take a moment, stop, breathe""... like how do you stay so chill and relaxed all the time? How are you not constantly freaking out???

265,Did any of you eventually develop an intolerance for Exercise?,"**Please read.**

Exercise, especially hiking/walking, used to make me feel so much better. High intensity sometimes made me feel worse, but walking calmed me down and got me to a place of peace.

But now, even just going for a 60 minute walk leads to psychological symptoms like anxiety and depression. 

It's like my body doesn't want me to do any long term physical activity. I'm not afraid to exercise. When this first started I was looking forward to my hiking holiday as it usually brings me peace, but I was having panic attacks during the night.

I thought it was just me having a mental break down until I noticed that my symptoms were building up as I was engaging in physical activity. Since I stopped hiking or jogging, I've had no panic attacks at all.

So I thought I may have just been pushing myself too hard, but it's literally just 2-3 mile walks that are doing it. Last night I felt the tension in my chest and ribs plus the cracking in my jaw even after 1 mile. 

Is it possible to notice worse anxiety/depression with any form of physical activity?"

I said why did you even tell me to express my concerns and he said because it's fun.

268,HELP ME MAKE LATE NEW YEARS RESOLUTION GOAL FOR ANXIETY DISORDER,"Hey guys I'm a 22 year old college student and I have been clinically anxious for as long as I remember.  I have also inherited my families lineage genetic Bipolar disorder in my late teens but am proud to say that in the last year with a combination of medication and help from doctors I can say for the first time in years that deep depression and unstable highs are no longer a part of my life. But Anxiety is still there, every minute of every day. Being not depressed has made me realize how it is effecting my life: My friendships are completely based on alcohol, I have no social skills sober and sitting in a college lecture makes me sweat and shake. Every decision I make is based on fear. I feel like my life is wasting away in front of me and I want it to change. 

**My goal this year is: Treat my anxiety disorder and Improve social skills**

Im aware how broad and ambitious this goal is. My question is has anybody set a new years resolution or any resolution surrounding this? if so what were your metrics for success, what were your steps to get there and did you achieve it? I feel like this is the year I can beat this I just don't know how to start.

I think I might be on the cusp of a nervous breakdown for the first time in my life. I'm taking care of my sick little guy and we nearly lost him twice. I've already grieved him during vet procedures that he wasn't supposed to make it out of (having him survive both times was incredible but also a shock) and we're having to check on him several times throughout the night. They're so incredibly fragile. My reassurance seeking is through the roof but also combined with unusual behaviour (obviously! because he's sick!) is frying my nerves.

Thankfully a family member offered to care for him today. I spent the past 12 hours locked in a room unable to get out of bed. I'm barely taking care of myself and I'm so overwhelmed. I'm so burnt out I can't even cry. Just constant terror and nausea and it won't let go of me.

I feel like I'm too scared to hope for anything good to happen-- like what if I jinx it somehow? but that doesn't make any sense. I feel like I'm living in an alternative universe. Every normal routine feels wrong and out of place. I feel like I'm losing my mind.

272,"My SO has crippling anxiety, and I'm not sure how to broach the subject.","Hi. My gf has suffered from anxiety and panic attacks for years, and while she's made a lot of progress in some ways, it's also gotten worse in others. To her credit, she goes to therapy, is on Buspirone, and has not been avoiding the things that bring on panic attacks, e.g. flights and hiking. However, it hasn't seemed to have gotten any better, and any time we're getting deep in the woods she freezes up and can't go any further. Same with flights, every time we fly it's a day long, exhausting battle to get through it. This is hard for me, because I want to be able to do the things I love with the person I love, and her anxiety is making them almost unbearable. 

I love her, and I try to do my best to understand and to be there present, but truth is I have no idea what she's going through or how to help. We've been having some communication issues and fights lately, and when I brought up how I feel a little limited in my hobbies by her anxiety, it destroyed her. 

Similarly, in the past I asked her about what would happen if we had a child and I was away for a weekend. What if a panic attack set in? Would she still able to care for our child? I thought these were valid questions but she took great offense to this. 

So I guess my question is, how do I address my concerns without offending her? Any advice is appreciated. "

I live with my mom. I love her to death. Maybe wasn't the best at raising me, but really understanding since she has mental problems of her own. I didn't grow up with any other family, siblings, or friends. She's in her 50s and has ME/CFS, where the average death age is in one's 50s. She has other health problems and also smokes. I'm so terrified of her dying. I have anxiety attacks about it every day, along with other things. I refuse to live in a world where she is not there and I have plans not to. 

Usually, people would just say to ""cherish the time"" and ""make memories"" and ""remember the good times you have had with her."" But it's actually really annoying. I know that's the only logical thing to do, but I'm venting, not looking for logical answers.

I can't remember. My memories of growing up have mostly disappeared because of my mental health, and my mental health gets worse day by day, so I know I will continue to lose more memories. I can't even remember what I did yesterday. At all. Let alone what I did with my mom. I am so exhausted from anxiety every day that I never have time or motivation to do anything with her anyway. If we go out anywhere, I am not mentally there. It's like watching a movie and the audio is muffled. I'm always in my head, full of fear, so it's not like I even make memories now. 

I know I love her. I love her so much I start crying thinking of her. But why? Why do I love her? I don't remember why.

275,My anxiety about taxes.,"I resigned from a job last year, all good, no issues there. Except it's February 29th and I haven't gotten my T4 yet from them. And I am way too panicked to call them and ask when my T4 will be either put on ADP, or sent in the mail. So I can't file my taxes. And then the fact that I can't file my taxes is causing me more anxiety which now is making me panic more and really not want to call and ask where my T4 is.

Sorry for all the non Canadians. T4 is the Canadian equivalent to the American W2 (and for non Americans, basically all your paycheques (Canadian spelling lol) and the taxes for the money you made in one letter), and ADP is a payroll website. And law states the employer has to send my T4 before the end of February.

280,Why does cold weather do this to me?,"Every time the temperature drops below about 30¬∞ I am miserable, It doesn't matter how warm or cold it is inside, It's not sun exposure, I don't go outside a lot when it's warm or cold, It's not dry air I constantly have a humidifier going, when it is cold outside my mental health tanks and I don't understand why? The internet doesn't have answers, I'll find things on seasonal affective disorder but the explanation for that is people don't have as much sun exposure but I don't go outside very often regardless of how much sunlight there is. People say maybe it's the shorter days but I'm basically nocturnal anyway, I'm usually up between 5:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. and I don't have any mental health problems when it's warm outside with that very same arrangement.

281,me and my thoughts,"Hi! I'm on 10 mg of escitalopram and i just want to share my anxiety experience.

I can say that I am a very anxious person, even before starting medication a month ago. It heightened wnd triggered when someone dear to me, close to my age passed.

Everytime I encounter stories about people my age passing, my mind always thinks it's gonna happen to me too. A heart attack, an aneurysm, etc.

does anybody have the same feelings? How do i overcome this?

283,How do you accept day long severe anxiety?,"I'm in the proces of learning to manage my anxiety and I've been doing well but there is one type of anxiety that just makes me consider going on meds again.

That type of anxiety hit me today: day long severe anxiety that comes out of the blue and has no triggers, pretty sure it's 100% neurological. This morning when I left the house I noticed I was shakey and had some teeth chatter. A sense of impending doom came next and it hasn't left my body since. My jaw is painful from clenching, I'm exhausted, my ears are ringing and I had the worst time concentrating today. 10/10 godawful day for no reason. A huge contrast with the past week when I felt great.

Am I stupid for wanting to beat this without meds? Or is there a pathway to a life where I learn to manage these days as well and they get less severe? It never escalates into panic attacks anymore, already learned that, but tbh severe anxiety that lasts a whole day or even longer is just worse

She said if I do have it which is not impossible she says she had patients that have no need for meds and don‚Äôt need ablation. I am just scared if it is SVT and I do need an Ablation‚Ä¶

In better detail it feels like my chest sinks in and then (this feels like a fast gradual) from like 90bpm or so to 200bpm which stays like that for 20 minutes. When it ends, every other time it came down gradually but one time it felt like a small thud and it was back to normal.

Today at work, I was sent off for a task to set up a new computer for a client. 

Well, when I got there, I got really overwhelmed. 

I was in a place I didn't know. I was doing something I'd never done before. I was around people that had no idea who I was and I didn't know who they were (*shooting me strange looks when I came into their room as they weren't expecting me*). And when I asked them where spare PC monitors were, they looked at me like I was crazy.

It was a lot going wrong all at once which caused me to start sweating, tripping over my words, etc. 

I even called my supervisor and asked him what am I supposed to do and he gave me simple answers in a tone that I perceived as annoyed and condescending. I snapped at him for it out of stress.  (I proceeded to apologize to him later and he accepted my apology)

My brain went into panic mode.

I'm really not sure if it's just a self-esteem/low confidence issue, but it was an awful feeling and lingered the rest of the day.

Curious people's thoughts if I'm right and this is just an issue of low confidence levels."

314,Worried about the future (a vent) ,"Hello everyone, this post is basically a long vent because I feel like I need to share my thoughts with someone and idk, maybe someone will relate. I hope that's okay.


I've always struggled with anxiety (it calmed down a bit during my senior year of highschool and first year of college but then started again). Lately I've been anxious about the future, both near and not so near.

Context: I live in Eastern Europe.

Personal stuff: I failed college (a mixture of bad luck and a temporary drop in mental health, college is free in my country so there was no financial loss at least). I want to come back and finish my studies in autumn. I've been living at home for some time, doing chores, cooking, that sort of thing. I'm looking for a job and I found some offers that would suit me. However, my parents told me that they're worried that once I settle into a comfortable job, I'll lose the motivation to go back to college. I'm going to get a job anyway but I worry that they may be right as I'm also worried that I'll fail again and the thought makes me want to give up on college.


World-scale stuff: I'm worried and scared about stuff like war and environmental pollution (especially microplastics). For the latter, I'm trying my best to be eco-friendly (recycling, using public transport, limiting plastic use) but I feel like my efforts don't mean anything. And when it comes to war... There is truly nothing I can do. I'm scared of dying (or getting seriously hurt in any way) but I'm even more scared of my family dying. I listen to the news almost obsessively and I fail to find the balance between doomscrolling and staying informed.


More personal stuff: Hopefully I'll die of old age. It would be ideal. However, some of my ancestors (great-grandparents, grandparents and some distant relatives) sufferred from dementia and I'm scared it will happen to me too.

I guess that's it. I don't really need advice as my problems won't resolve till my personal situation changes and the world situation improves. Until then I'll just have to hope for the best I guess.

321,The pressure of needing a boyfriend,"This is my day to day worry. And it hurts bad inside ever time i think about it.

I am 25 and currently single. I‚Äôve had like 2 bf before. But never told my family about them, so they think I have never dated. Which causes me desperation because being my age they might think i have something wrong or hiding something.

I love my single life because I feel independent and its great. I‚Äôve met the worse guys ever during last year when I had the urge to have a bf desperately.

They treated me like shit and experienced things I really wouldn‚Äôt recommend if you have a sensitive soul. As i was desperate I also developed desperate patterns in my behavior towards them which could be the reason why they also acted that way.

Im learning with time and experience.

However, what makes my anxious is my family‚Äôs opinion about my dating and sexual life/orientation. I am heterosexual. I fully like guys and what they bring. Im attracted to them and never felt that way for a woman. There is nothing wrong with being bi or gay. I have many friends that are and i love them.

What annoys me its them thinking i am and deducing it because i have no bf or no interest in having one. Or because i never really talk about dating with my family. 

This has made me feel anxious and in need for a bf but at the same time i have no interest in it. And the lack of it makes me go crazy again.

How can i stop this? Does this happen to people often?

327,Vent about anxiety‚Äôs physical symptoms,"This post is just to vent‚Ä¶.I no longer think of anxiety as just a mental illness - I have become so physically sick from anxiety that I am in constant pain. I chronically clench my jaw so my entire jawline is sore. I throw up when I become too anxious, which in times of bad anxiety can be multiple times a day. I sleep with my arms in the t-Rex position and I have daily wrist and joint pain. Frequent chest pain and shortness of breath. Stomach aches followed by diarrhea. On any given day I have at least 3 of those symptoms. My anxiety actually used to be worse than this before medication, but I can now at least function in my daily life (Im a graduate student, doing very well in school, etc.). I‚Äôve also visited doctors and been checked out for every illness you can imagine - it‚Äôs simply anxiety causing this. 

And don‚Äôt get me wrong, I know anxiety is not a terminal illness and I am much much more fortunate than many to go to the doctor and find out that I‚Äôm not dying‚Ä¶..but at the same time, it‚Äôs insanely frustrating to know that there is nothing wrong with you and your body is choosing to sabotage itself."

330,Morning anxiety makes me want to sleep forever ,"My morning anxiety has gotten to a point where I throw up before brushing daily. I‚Äôm on klonopin sparingly (taking it on need basis). I am going through a really tough time personally and waking up just scares me now, so I try my best to stay in bed and meditate for a while before I get out of bed. Nothing is helping me.

"
331,Does anyone else worry about not being worried?,"I don't really know how to explain this.

Essentially, anxiety on some level has been my default setting since before I can remember, like a young child, and I'm 32 now.

When I'm not worried about anything - and specifically, when I'm having a good time even - I then start to have anxiety about the fact that nothing is worrying me. It hits on two levels: 1) the fact that this feeling is relatively alien, and then 2) I start to then worry that I'm abnormally happy/hyper/relaxed (or a combination thereof), and that something must be incredibly wrong with me (like I start worrying that maybe I'm bipolar and about to start having a manic episode or something).

I know, rationally, that this is (probably) not the case. But it's almost like my brain cannot deal with not feeling some level of anxiety about at least something. It's almost like I've been so anxious for so long, that this is my base-level state so any time I feel less anxiety than usual (or just happy or excited for whatever reason), my brain goes to the thought that something must be wrong.

It's very conflicting as the happiness, excitement, enjoyment, relaxed feeling is still there, but with a layer of unnecessary on top and it feels very uncomfortable.

Does anyone else get this?"
332,Witnessed father murder mother,"Hello everyone, I am looking for advice. Over ten years ago i witnessed my father murder my mother. I tried to save her but was unable to. I have regrets every single day and am training to work in health care to fulfill the void in my heart of the lack of knowledge I had. If I would've known what to do at the time maybe she'd be here. My dad was very abusive and I had to testify against him in court. It was a long painful trial. This was over 10 years ago but I can't stop thinking about it. I want to get a wife and settle down but I feel so broken. I don't know how to cope. I try to turn to religion to cope with this pain and lose, but i'm still a broken mess. I've gone to so much therapy, I had to live in foster care till I graduated. I don't know how to come over this but I want to so bad. I met a girl who was amazing but I pushed her away because I feel so broken."
333,Help with alcohol,"I am going through a rough divorce and some other things in my personal life that are causing me crazy anxiety. I have been using alcohol to cope more than I should because it‚Äôs like the only thing that takes my anxiety away. It numbs me and makes me enjoy life for a few hours. 

Every night I don‚Äôt drink I get massive spurts of anxiety, cannot fall asleep, and just lie in bed massively anxious until I give up and have a drink or two. Sleep aids, melatonin, etc. don‚Äôt work for me. Benedryl works sometimes to just knock me out. 

What are some alternatives or tips for drinking less, but still fighting the anxiety? I‚Äôm sick of the hangovers and I know it‚Äôs not a healthy way to cope. But, I‚Äôm currently lying in bed sober and incredibly anxious. I‚Äôm not on any medications. My friends tell me to just replace alcohol with CBD/THC, but I don‚Äôt want to replace one substance with another."
334,Prolonged fight or flight?,"So I've struggled with anxiety for years, but recently things have been really bad. In short, it's harder to eat, I'm losing weight (4 pounds in a week) my feet are sweaty, I'm constantly checking my symptoms and I'm getting really worried that something more might be going on. I went to my PCP, they ran blood and urine, checked diabetes, hormone levels, CMP, CBC, you name it. Basically, everything came up normal aside from some leukocytes in the urine. I've heard about the fight or flight response and was wondering if anyone else might have had similar symptoms. I feel like I'm losing my mind. My shoulders are always tight, my posture is horrible, breathing is shallow, I'm very sedentary, I don't exercise, diet isn't the best, but even with all these things it hasn't been as bad as this past week or so. Any advice or experiences like this? I could use some help."

336,Propranolol: anyone have experience with it that can ease my fears?,"So I recently stopped my antidepressant (lexapro) about 3-4 months ago due to having more ways of managing my anxiety. For context I am in college doing a graduate program and I‚Äôve been noticing recently that my heart starts pounding like crazy whenever I either have to present something in class or even if I raise my hand to speak. I have been on lexapro since before starting this graduate program and while on lexapro I never really experienced a racing heart simply for raising my hand to speak, and the presentation anxiety feels much more intense. My psychiatrist prescribed me propranolol to use as needed for before a presentation that might trigger this or if I think I might have a stressful class. Lexapro helped me a lot while I was on it but I don‚Äôt like relying so much on medications so I was excited to handle things on my own. I also have Xanax as well that I can use as needed.

The propranolol sounds like it could be really helpful for presentation anxiety based on what I have read about how it works, however, I can‚Äôt seem to get over the fear of taking this new medication (I‚Äôve never taken propranolol before). I know it‚Äôs a BETA blocker that slows the heart rate and helps with the physical symptoms of anxiety which would be GREAT for these presentations, but considering some of my anxiety is related to health anxiety I have been over thinking this and worrying about it making my blood pressure too low or sending me into cardiac arrest, lol. My psychiatrist said to try it out at home when I‚Äôm not expected to perform to see how it affects me but I can‚Äôt shake this fear that it might hurt me or kill me. Have any of you taken propranolol before and what was the experience like ? Do you think I‚Äôm over thinking and it‚Äôs safer than I‚Äôm making it out to be? If anyone has a career related to studying mental health medications that might be able to ease my fears that‚Äôd be great too.

TLDR: I was recently prescribed propranolol for presentation anxiety and I‚Äôm afraid of the medication hurting me, anyone have experience with this medication that can ease my fears?"
337,Did I avoid an anxiety attack correctly‚ùìÔ∏è,"
Hi reader, to give you an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe context, I will leave some basic information here. I am a girl diagnosed with anxiety and my most recent psychologist recommended going to the gym. I've been going to the gym for a year and it helped me a lot, my medications are also up to date, but something unexpected happened today.
There is an instructor at my gym, he is a nice dude and has never hurt anyone. But because I feel uncomfortable I sometimes avoid looking directly at him or asking for his help (this also happens with other male instructors) and I know that he knows that I avoid looking at his face, that I hide from his presence and try to ignore him.
Today I was sitting resting, that's when he came over to pick up some weights and said ""Hi"" to me kindly. Desperately, I looked into nothing and pretended not to hear. At that moment when I ignored him, I felt terrible, I wanted to answer, but I couldn't.
I was already feeling guilty about it, but I decided to move on. But then that's when he accidentally dropped my bottle on the floor making a loud noise (he didn't realize what he had done). So I picked up my bottle from the floor, I wasn't mad since it was just an accident and it hadn't damaged anything. However, FOR NO REASON I started to feel anxious and I felt like crying. I tried to calm down, but I just wanted to burst into tears. So, trying to use my brain for something useful, I decided to go home without finishing the 3 exercises I had to do, just because I was scared of having an anxiety attack. 

Did I avoid the situation correctly? I would sincerely like to hear words of support, but if you want to give me some tips to improve, I would appreciate it. (Also, sorry for the bad text, english is not my first language and I'm not that good at grammar.)

Despite that my health anxiety is still through the roof and lately it's been presenting itself as a palpitation feeling in my throat, always momentarily, which makes my throat feel heavy and gives me the sense that my heart is beating right in my throat. i aslo experience trouble talking at that moment but eventually it goes away.  i've done the whole cardiology check ( Ekg, Echo, stress test, 96 hours Holter monitor ) and my results are perfect.

348,Advice on how to deal with anxiety in chest ,"So to start off about 3-4 weeks ago I had what the doctors deemed a panic attack. It was all day and an aching throb in my chest, couldn't sleep, cried all day finally went to the ER that night, they ran an EKG and heart monitor and everything was fine besides slightly elevated heart rate due to stress.
Thankfully, the day after this stopped after forcing myself to sleep through the night, but ever since then I've been sick. A longing ache in my chest, shortness of breathe, difficulty doing tasks, I've had aching radiating both left and right and sit in the middle of my chest. No jaw pain. Headaches sometimes.
It's gotten better, and somewhat manageable. I can go places again some days but other days all I can do is lay in bed.
I have trouble sleeping, only get about 5-6 hours with a nap for another 3 after my morning tasks, and sometimes can't sleep because my "" heart "" ( middle of chest ) will ache badly. It gives me sleep anxiety.
I've seen a therapist, and a doctor twice, all say it's anxiety. I'm 19 and afab and want to know is it really just that? Can an attack have lingering effects for weeks? Can I do anything to improve it? Stretches, medicine? The tightness in my chest is nearly constant with very brief sharp pains every now and then, and I just want it to stop. Any tips? 

EDIT: I have a known severe vitamin D deficiency that I'm currently working on with prescribed vitamins. Does this effect anything? "
349,How do i get over extreme anxiety about bad things i‚Äôve done?,"
I am getting intense guilt over lying in the past 

I keep having intense waves of guilt.

I always have a fear all of my friends are going to leave me because they‚Äôll discover something about me that they don‚Äôt like.

for example, a while ago i was in the school musical and it was just not good for my mental health. i didn‚Äôt like it, it was causing me to fall behind in school and i also just had really bad mental health at the time. but i knew that they wouldn‚Äôt let me quit if my only excuse was that i didn‚Äôt want to do it.

so i lied and said that my mom was making me quit, and that if i failed my most recent math test then i had to quit.

i did, and i quit. in all fairness my mom didn‚Äôt want me to be in musical theatre because the director has been mean to me in the past but she never told me to quit.

i said my mom told me that if i got less than a 65 on my upcoming math test, id have to quit. while i said that because i knew id fail my classes if i didnt have the time, my mom and i came to that agreement together. i feel so bad for saying that because i feel like it was dragging it out longer than i should have.

i just feel like all of my friends in musical theatre would hate me if they found out i lied, especially because i don‚Äôt like lying.



it‚Äôs late at night and these things always hit late at night. i just want to confess everything to them because i feel like it‚Äôs worse if they don‚Äôt know. at least if i tell them they know im a immoral person.

if anyone is wondering about the musical theatre thing my director ended up asking me to rejoin because they didn‚Äôt have enough people so i did. so it didn‚Äôt even matter in the long run.

i just feel like this lie makes me a horrible person and questions my integrity. i feel like everybody would hate me if they found out my mom didn‚Äôt make me quit. 

so do i confess to them? will it just make things worse? am i a bad person for telling this lie? it‚Äôs eating me inside and i can‚Äôt move on. every time i see or think about my friends im hit with overwhelming guilt because i feel like im deceiving them. will they stop loving me if they find out i lied? i just feel like i owe it to them to tell them, even though in my head i know most people lie, even them sometimes.



if its important i have a subset of OCD (technically OCD-like symptoms caused by PTSD but its easier to just say it‚Äôs OCD because all the symptoms are there) that includes morality, past events and false memories. confessing has been a compulsion in the past."

354,Auditory Hallucinations,"This first happened in December of 2023. Brief history: I started smoking (marijuana) December of 2022, smoked for about 6 months and then traveled to Australia (where I took about a 4 month T-break), and immediately started smoking again come November 2023. I smoke daily. I only smoke indica biased hybrids, and indica. I rarely take edibles, and mainly smoke blunts and use my pen. 

Anyways this all started mid December. The first time it happened I was high. It was like there was another person in my head speaking another language. But, it is still MY internal monologue voice that I usually hear on a daily basis. It‚Äôs really all gibberish. But it sounds like words. Like I said, it sounds like when you listen to someone speak a language you don‚Äôt know. The words are flying through my head so fast that when I try and focus on one, to maybe try and verbalize what that ‚Äúword‚Äù was, it‚Äôs gone and there‚Äôs new ‚Äúwords‚Äù. The first time it happened, I was high. It lasted about 10-15 minutes. It didn‚Äôt happen again for over a month, but when it did I was completely sober. Now it happens to me almost daily regardless of my intoxication. 

I can‚Äôt describe it any better than gibberish in my head. I can‚Äôt control it. I can‚Äôt get out of it. I usually just sit and wait. It‚Äôs very uncomfortable, but not scary or threatening. If anyone else has ever experienced this, PLEASE reach out. I struggle with pretty severe anxiety (which is why I smoke) and this is taking a toll on me. Oh and lastly, I stopped smoking 2 days ago and it has still happened since.  "

356,Anxiety ruined my life. I wish I'd just sleep and not wake up.,"If my mom were not still alive, I would shoot myself in the head. I don't want to feel the pain of anxiety and do shit jobs till I die.

I (m 35) feel like a loser. Because of anxiety, I dropped out of college twice. I didn't finish my useless humanities degree till I was 30 years old.  I have a job but I dont have a career. I often get so anxious about issues: work, relationships, money, the future. 
I am very ambitious and intellectually curious. I'd like to work hard. I don't even mind going back to school and getting a solid degree. But anxiety is a bad handicap. I'm always in my head worrying and stressing about stuff. 
I cannot accept to be a loser. I dont want  to do shitty customer service or retail jobs for the rest of my life. I want to have a career,  nice house and a car. But my anxiety hobbles my ambition. 

I've dealt with anxiety since I was a teenager.  Besides the emotional pain it causes, it also makes it hard to succeed professionally and financially.  

With my current education,  the only solid career I can get is a teacher. The problem is I'm socially anxious. So in seeking stability and work security, I would be exposed to a massive anxiety trigger."

Something that happened at work is really stressing me out. It's triggered me. I'm at the point where I'm literally, physically, pounding my head to convince myself to read an email. 

It's not a panic attack, yet. I'm hoping it's not. I've had one from this job already. Went to the ER thinking it was a heart attack. Felt like it. Got treated. I started going to a therapist for it. But that's all out of the window right now. I can't remember any of my sessions at therapy. Just tried to talk to my husband about this just now. Then I heard him huff out in frustration from being interrupted, cause he's wfh too. So seeing that further fuelled my anxiety and so I drew back. I told him never mind even though I distantly heard him being apologetic for his initial reaction, but I retreated back to my home office and locked the door and told him to go away. 

I can't call my therapist. I can't call anyone else. This is stupid. I'm being stupid. I shouldn't be this anxious about reading an email. It's stupid. It's stupid. Just fucking read it. Read it. Read it. Read it. I'm trying to remember what my therapist told me. Something about coins? How much you want to invest on something? Or a river? I don't remember and it's making me even more useless. I don't know what my point writing this here is. I'm a fucking man. I'm a fucking adult. I just need to fucking grow up and read this God damn email. Just stop being fucking stupid. So stupid. So stupid. 

No I'm not stupid. I'm not. I'm not. I want I think I'm not but it's making me think of all of this and how fucking stupid it is to feel this way and act this way and I can't fucking talk to anybody cause I'm fucking annoying to everyone and every thing. Just read the fucking email. There's no point to this. I have no fucking point. I'm fucking pointless. 

I'm writing this. And reading this. I can read this. Reading this is fine. I'm writing this. I can still think. It's there. I can't change that. It's already happened, I should think that that's fine. I need to stop thinking about what it could be. My feelings are already hurt. Am I going to get fired? Probably not. Writing stream of thought is good. I think swipe is helping. Cause typos happen or auto completion uses the wrong word and I have to be mindful to go back and edit my mistakes. Mistakes can be fixed. Like all these sentences. Like this post. It's ok. It's ok. Just read the email. It's ok. It's ok. I can talk about it next time I'm in therapy. Just breathe. It's ok. It's ok."

364,"Anxiety kept me productive, and now I‚Äôm aimless. ","I‚Äôve had anxiety and OCD for as long as I can remember. I decided to bite the bullet and go on Prozac 20mg. My anxiety is pretty much completely gone and I feel content, even happy/joyful sometimes. 

The problem is that now I‚Äôm apathetic to things I used to be on top of. I think my anxiety fueled me to be productive and was like 90% of my personality or the drive behind my decisions. It got me into grad school, a good job, kept my relationships solid. But I was unhappy. 

Now I‚Äôm happy and can‚Äôt seem to get my fucking work done. I‚Äôm also in grad school (at the end thankfully) and not sure why. I feel less interested in being a huge support to everyone around me which has actually made my marriage better as I‚Äôm more present with my husband, but my other friendships are suffering because I‚Äôm pretty apathetic. I go to the gym regularly, take part in my hobbies, but only because I want to do them.

Now, I been all day anxious because in less than a week I going to start my classes in new university and I try to get calm driking coffee even if I stopped drinking it for almost 10 months (I KNOW that it was a terrible idea, but it calm me for a few minutes, until I just feel worst) i been feeling like I almost can't breathe, I being having nauseas.

Im gonna be honest, I was always a home person, I have friends but it just happened. I made no effort to initiate the conversation for my firendships that I have. It takes time for me to acclimate into a new environment, my mind is on high alert, I feel vulnerable, I feel like the child I was in elementary school until about 2 weeks period.  
Th problem is, by the time I become comfortable to socialize, my outward impression is either intimidating or just uncomfortable. People tend to tell me I gaze or interact with others like they're are a burden to talk to that is far from the case. I want to socialize and laugh with others but the moment we make eye contact, either I instinctively look away or they look away.  
This leads me to another problem, It's not that I can't maintain eye contact but because Im not used having random conversation with strangers, I become self conscious about everything I do. Im confident but I'm trying my best not impose nor seen as trying to intimidate anyone at all which is counter-productive since now Im moving like a person learning how to walk again. I just want to learn how to maintain eye contact without feeling this level of intense anxiety.  
I don't want the interviewer to think I can't do the job, I know I can . I just need a chance man.  
Any tips????"
368,Propranolol Withdrawal? ,"Hey guys - 

I‚Äôve been reading some threads on here and wanted to see if anyone could provide some insight. I recently was prescribed 10 mg/propranolol 3x a day. I stuck with this for about a week before my doctor increased my dosage to 20mg, 3x day. I did that for about a week and started to have some horrible side effects. 

I stopped taking the medication all together. It‚Äôs day 4 and I‚Äôm having some horrible withdrawals which sounds crazy because I wasn‚Äôt on it for that long. It made my derealization 10x worst, confusion, spacey,  pounding heart, insomnia, sweating, shakiness, and no appetite. I feel like I‚Äôm having a panic attack 24/7. I‚Äôve been bed ridden for the past 4 days. 

Anybody have a similar experience? If so, how long did your withdrawal symptoms last? I‚Äôm scared these symptoms will never go away. Please help! "

For example, my best friend came to visit for a few days and stayed with me. I‚Äôve visited her twice before as well. Every time I have horrific anxiety, stomach gas and pain, nausea, etc. It leaves me unable to fully enjoy anything, even though I desperately want to. I have another trip coming up in June and while I think ‚Äúyes I‚Äôm excited to go see her/go to another convention‚Äù, I fear how it will leave me again.

I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs the change in routine or what, but it leaves me in a worse state every single time. 

Usually a few days after a trip/event I feel fine again because I‚Äôm able to spend a lot of time alone to recuperate, but I‚Äôm tired of pretending it‚Äôs fine until the next time when I fall again. 

I don‚Äôt have social anxiety and am fine interacting with people, and do so at work on a day to day basis, but whenever I‚Äôm not at work I just want to be in my room, alone. I want to lie in bed with my laptop and turn my brain off. I look at my friends who want to chat and go out constantly and I feel so alienated from their perspectives. I just can‚Äôt feel it.

I started panicking right away and got nauseas and then couldn't sleep because I was worried the nausea was due to hitting my head (could have been anxiety) and thought I felt pain in my head the whole night but I don't think I hit it hard enough to have symptoms.

377,Throat symptoms?,"I (28M) have a physical in a few weeks and plan to bring this up, but my wife is deadset that it is just anxiety. Granted, I've struggled with anxiety-related symptoms my whole life and I've been pretty stressed lately, so I know the odds are in her favor, but still, I'm curious if anyone can relate.

I feel this thumping when I swallow. It comes and goes and is not consistent, nor does it hurt. It's just when I swallow it feels like a heavy thump in addition to the gulp that comes with swallowing. I don't otherwise feel any type of lump.

Also occasional, but my throat muscles get TENSE, now this isn't the kind of sore you feel when you have a cold, this feels like the muscles in my throat are being pulled or something. I think it's even impacting my vocal cords maybe, because when I talk too much I find it gets worse. I can still breathe and don't necessarily feel like I'm being choked, but it is incredibly uncomfortable. The tension typically eases when I'm eating a meal though.

These symptoms both come and go with no noticable trigger, of course I am playing worst case scenario here and plan to ask the doctor about it, but I figured I'd ask here anyway to see if anyone can relate?"

382,Hit my head now I‚Äôm worried,"Hi everyone, I am a 21F. Last night I accidentally banged the top left side of my head against my bedroom wall. My vision went blurry for a split second followed by a pain in my head as expected. 

The stingy pain subsided maybe 5 minutes later after A LOT of tears were shed and my boyfriend trying not laugh while consoling me (it was kind of funny). The exact same thing happened exactly a year ago except I banged the back of my head and went to the overnight doctor and the conclusion was that I had a concussion. 

Back to present, I‚Äôve woken up this morning with a terrible headache that feels like it‚Äôs around my head and mainly my forehead, feeling groggy, tired and very anxious. I took paracetamol but it‚Äôs not working. I do suffer with severe anxiety and ocd traits. The last time this happened my mental health was fine but now I‚Äôve been suffering with my MH for the last few months. 

So of course my anxiety and ocd are all on board right now that I have a severe concussion and a bleed on the brain, I‚Äôm trying to convince myself that people every day probably had a lot worse bangs to the head and that I‚Äôm fine and don‚Äôt need to go hospital but I can‚Äôt shake the fear. 

Just to add: I feel like I‚Äôve been suffering with sinus for the last week, blocked nose, headache constantly, blocked ears but haven‚Äôt felt the symptoms in 2 days so maybe that‚Äôs also it ? 

Can I have anyone else‚Äôs thoughts on this as my head feels like it‚Äôs in a fog and I can‚Äôt think straight. Should I go to hospital ? Is it a concussion ? Or is it just my anxiety ? "

Instead of being happy with the things I‚Äôve accomplished by 26, all I can I think about is how I‚Äôm too old to be dating someone where there‚Äôs so many external obstacles against us, because that means I‚Äôm going to run out of time to have kids..at 26.

384,Anxiety (touch wood) is slowly decreasing?,"TLDR: About 3 weeks ago I had a massive panic attack. One of the worst I've ever had. Afterwards my anxiety was at such a heightened state it was almost unbearable. Nearly every day I considered going to the ER due to health anxiety (thinking I was having a heart attack, stroke, kidney failure, and a whole host of things).

I'm almost hesitant to type this out but all of a sudden it just seems to have.... gone? I still have some mental and physical symptoms (kind of a ""wired"" feeling and dry mouth).

Anyway just wanted to get some feedback, because funnily enough - the fact that my anxiety and symptoms have disappeared so much - may make me anxious again üòÇ"
385,What medication do you take for social anxiety?,"My anxiety seems to be more related to social situations but I feel I have bits of GAD too. I get anxiety attack (high HR, shaking, sweating profusely) starting when I talk to people I haven‚Äôt talked to in a while, and friends. This also happens in phone calls with friends or where emotions are involved (work for me).   I‚Äôm fine with interactions with people I have nothing to do with eg Cashier, phone calls to call agents. 

 I have been avoiding them trying to heal naturally for a year. And I‚Äôm not seeing a big progress and some things are getting worse. 
I‚Äôm scared of the side effects (mostly digestive issues) and relying on it forever. Also, knowing that they don‚Äôt really do a lot in terms of improvement sometimes and sometimes require alot of trial and error. 

I take propranolol rarely for therapy and some situations where i anticipate nervousness. And it makes me feel good but i sweat like a pig on it tooüò≠ which makes me conscious and feel unwell because im soaked. 

If you guys have something similar, what medication have you been taking? Do they work well? What has helped you?

391,GAD - Med Change Advice,"I‚Äôm on the hunt for something better for my anxiety. I have GAD that causes nausea and vomiting if I‚Äôm not on something plus worry about things that aren‚Äôt a big deal, or positive things. And lately, health anxiety after a health scare a few months ago. Currently on buspirone but hate how it‚Äôs 2x/day and I don‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs covering my anxiety. It‚Äôs also been causing gas/gas pain/constipation and perhaps blurred vision slightly. I was on Wellbutrin for over 2 years and that worked amazingly for my anxiety and less sexual side effects than I had with Prozac/lexapro (that was the reason I came off those 2) BUT I had too much weight loss with Wellbutrin. I dropped from 300mg to 150mg and that helped some but my weight just kept dropping. With buspirone, I wake up anxious and then get anxious again in the evening. It has a half life of like 11 hrs so that‚Äôs not great. I started on 5mg>7.5>10>12.5>15 (came off Wellbutrin completely once I hit 15mg of buspirone)>20 and now on 25mg because the 20 still wasn‚Äôt relieving my anxiety completely. I‚Äôm debating going back on Prozac even with the sexual side effects. But have been reading about Cymbalta (duloxetine) as well. I really don‚Äôt want something that makes me drowsy, that‚Äôs why I loved Wellbutrin because it actually gave me some energy. Maybe since Cymbalta blocks norepinephrine uptake it‚Äôll give me a little energy like Wellbutrin did. 

So I‚Äôm basically deciding between Prozac or Cymbalta. Thoughts? I have Clonazepam and Zofran on hand for when anxiety and/or nausea occur and it sounds like Cymbalta causes a fair amount of nausea initially. "
392,Constantly Sick and Crying,"Good Morning,

Ever since Last November/early December I have just constantly been sick. I worked in healthcare before leaving and so I was exposed to a lot of stuff and had bronchitis twice. I was starting to get over it FINALLY late January and then allergy season hit early. Pollen has been super high and the weather has literally gone from 70 to snowing within 12 hours around here and so I know that's what's really triggering it. My chest has been sore from the constant cough I've had for months and is heavy, which is a huge trigger for me. Doesn't help we recently upped my zoloft dose so I'm in that period of high anxiety. Today I woke up and I just could not stop crying because I feel so shit and I'm exhausted, I'm just so tired... Anyone else feel like their anxiety has just made them getting sick easier?"
393,Can physical Anxiety symptoms appear without associated thoughts?,"I‚Äôve always been told emotions are the consequences of thoughts.

I‚Äôve recently become aware that the physical symptoms I experience that I was previously attributing to simply ‚Äúfeeling bad‚Äù or having a ‚ÄúLow mood‚Äù are actually Anxiety Symptoms:
- Muscle tension
- Chest pain
- Feeling of unease 
- Restlessness
- Constant diarrhea (Which is now starting to make more sense, but up to now I was just telling myself I had a bad digestive system)

Now my issue is that I don‚Äôt have any negative thoughts that seem to be triggering anxiety.

The only fears I have are a consequence of the physical anxiety symptoms: Fear that it won‚Äôt go away, that I won‚Äôt be able to live like this, and that at some point I just want to end it all (Don‚Äôt worry I‚Äôm not suicidal at all, those are just stupid thoughts I get when symptoms get worse)

I‚Äôm treated for ADHD so I have a therapist and will talk about this ‚Äúdiscovery‚Äù with her during our next session.

But in the meantime, do you guys know if it‚Äôs possible that no actual thoughts are causing these physical anxiety symptoms and that they are produced by something else?

I have came to it that I do have anxiety problem even though I‚Äôm on a medication for it now I still get all these pains. My question that I have is can anxiety just get that bad? And cause all these pains? I take a low dose of Xanax for now but when I‚Äôm calm my GI problems fire up and start causing the pains then I really do freak out and it seems to get bad for a few days. And my left side pains get so bad . I‚Äôm new to this I‚Äôve never been a worrier or anything I‚Äôve lived that wide open contractor life of just going and doing as I please with 0 worries. So what happened and with the mixture of the both can it really get that bad? And what do I need to do about the anxiety? They said the GI problems will cause the pains but with my new medication that will go away slowly but not with the anxiety. And I‚Äôm just lost I don‚Äôt even feel like my old self anymore. I get no joy to go golf hunt fish or anything"
409,Living with my BF & his family,I (24F) moved in with my BF (24M) and his family about a month ago because my lease was up and I can no longer afford an apartment since I‚Äôm staring school soon.

410,"Head pressure, tension headaches","Does anyone have head pressure and tension headache with their anxiety that travels in the head? Sometimes it‚Äôs at the back, sometimes sides behind my ears, sometimes the top of head and sometimes it goes to my forehead and I can feel the pressure even in my nose. It‚Äôs pretty strong. There is a lot of nerve pain too such as tingling or burning on my scalp. It gets worse when I sit or stand, like my head gets fuzzy, vibrating, sometimes it feels like my brain drops or like someone is tugging at it from behind or like it‚Äôs being pumped with air. The longer I am up, the more out of it I feel and I get derealization and brain fog. When I am up for too long the burning and buzzing goes to my neck, shoulders and upper back too, I might feel hot. It all calms down a lot when I lie down. No sinus issues. My neck feels weird too, waiting for a chiropractor appointment to see if it helps. Waiting for a neurologist appointment too and scared it‚Äôs a tumor because it‚Äôs so weird. I have never been a headache person.  "
411,I get weird feelings before a panic attack,"I can almost always tell when I‚Äôm going to have a panic attack during the day because I‚Äôll wake up completely uncomfortable in my body, skin feels tight and achy, hot spots.

I‚Äôve noticed feeling like this recently and it adds up to the days I‚Äôd have really bad panic attacks/:

419,Reasonable Explanation Before Going Back To The ER For The Second Time This Month.,"*Not sure if this is considered to be triggering, but it does talk about a physical symptom and irrational theories created from my mind so if you'd like to reframe from this post I completely understand.* 

Hello fellow *anxiety* suffers. For context, I have three main anxiety disorders. Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder EPA, and Severe Health Anxiety HA. I went to the hospital earlier this month around 2 weeks ago over a spontaneous migraine headache that lasted 5 days because I'm afraid of pills and convinced myself it was a brain tumor. 

It seems like I can never catch a break when it comes to feeling pain, whether *real or fake* so here I go again with a pain I know is real but being raised up in my mind as something awful and wondering if anyone has gone through the same pain who'd be willing to lend some advice. 

It's lasted three days off and on, no pain meds *of course* because again I am scared of pills, even Tylenol. It is in my mid to lower back and feels like a dull pain that happens only when I stand too long and usually goes away after sitting down or laying down. (Of course it hasn't yet, as I lay here typing, probably because I'm literally writing about it.)

My rational *and less dominant side* says its just from bad posture or I pulled a muscle while trying to pop my back a couple days ago. However, Mr Anxiety believes it is in fact a spinal hemorrhage of some sort or \**get this\** kidney failure. 

I know us anxiety folks deal with this crap *a lot* but just wondering if anyone else goes through the same and can rationalize with my non dominant part of theory that I am alright. You'd basically be my knight in shining armor without having to spend a huge bill over hearing the same thing from the ER staff that I am sure are sick of me already. 

Also, fun little add on, went to the doctor today as a follow up over my migraine headache ER trip and ended up turning into her concerned over my weight loss of 13 pounds in three months due to anxiety making me afraid to eat sometimes. Says its an eating disorder, I don't know I just figure its just a rare occurrence that I am currently doing better on and wants a weight update in **2 WEEKS** along with scary blood drawl on the 15th. Hurray! SCREW ANXIETY!!!

P.S... I HATE NEEDLES!"
420,I have my first dentist appointment in almost three years in an hour,"My dental hygiene has not been great.

They're not even doing a cleaning today, just taking xrays and figuring out a treatment plan. I'm so upset with myself

edit: thank you guys for the kind and supportive words :) I don't have cavities or gum disease and the recession is very minimal. I got into a car accident on the way there, which did not help my anxiety at all, but the other driver and staff were all very nice. Silver lining I guess."

423,I can‚Äôt sleep because I‚Äôm replaying my day,I don‚Äôt really expect any one to read this but I‚Äôm hoping that putting it in words will help me let it go. My job requires me to make a lot of judgement calls based on a number of different factors. Some one ended up getting hurt today‚Ä¶my decision couldn‚Äôt have prevented it from happening and I know that but my anxiety won‚Äôt go away.  I know that this happened because there were several supports that should have been put in place that weren‚Äôt before I took over the case. I can‚Äôt shake the feeling that I should have done more or something else. I probably should have responded in a more sympathetic manner but I just couldn‚Äôt force myself to feel bad when the missteps that were taken were so obvious it wasn‚Äôt a matter of if something bad was going to happen it was when something bad was going to happen. And today happened to be the day that the other shoe dropped. I guess I have anxiety because I‚Äôm caught between supporting the judgment call and feeling like I should have done more?
424,Can‚Äôt shake thinking I have stomach cancer ,"Just venting because I need to type this out

Some context, I‚Äôm a 34 year old male. I take lexapro 5mg for some general anxiety. For the past month I was sitting at work and all of a sudden I wanted to puke. That feeling has been on and off, but more on lately.  I‚Äôm not eating as much as normal. Lost some weight which is the only ‚Äúgood‚Äù thing. 

The trigger is I lost my dad to this cancer almost a year to the day I‚Äôm typing this. I‚Äôve been a long time sufferer of my own stomach issues (gerd) but I‚Äôm convinced I have it too. no need to google. I lived the stomach cancer journey with my dad. Made it only 8 months. 

I know naseau and heartburn like feelings can be a million other things or just nothing at all. I have a wife and 2 awesome kids. I have a lot too loose and that‚Äôs making me spiral.. I have an appointment next week with my GP and plan to have a serious conversation about it all. But why does our stupid brains go right to worse case scenario"
425,Does anyone else have a hesitancy about starting new TV/movies?,"In my case, I think it's because I have a fear of wasting time on something that isn't ""productive""; and maybe a case of being away from the Internet for a few hours and not being aware of what's going on in the world.

What about you guys?"
426,desperate scared 22f please help,"Hi please help me out -- I'm 22f. I am honestly terrified because my sleep generally has not been amazing (I track it every night, sometimes I wake up, other times I get around maybe 5-6 hours on average). But sleeping for 8 hours straight is basically unheard of for me. I'm so scared that this affects my productivity and prematurely ages me, but the fear makes my heart rate even higher in bed and I just CANT. SLEEP. AND IDK WHAT TO DO.  Like I am WAY too young for this and scared it will only get worse in grad school, with kids/marriage in the future, etc.  
I'm especially frustrated because I am currently sick with a fever; the night before last, I fell asleep at 11pm- woke up at midnight WIDE (I mean like VERY WIDE) awake. Then I stayed up till like 7AM. Admittedly, some of that was on screens, but I have a history of panic attacks and anxiety and it seems intolerable to close my eyes and feel existential dread knowing there is no distraction and sometimes I will just lie down that way (even with a blindfold, listening to a podcast). Then I slept from maybe 7-noon.  
LAST NIGHT, i had (have) a fever. I (1) did an ice dunk to help anxiety, (2) wore a red light mask and meditated 20 mins in bed, (3) drank herbal tea (4) put on a podcast (note: podcasts historically are about the only way I can sleep). But I lay awake for 30 mins and then gave up and proceeded to watch funny youtube videos to calm myself (heart rate was really high). I slept from like 4-7:50 AM and woke up WIRED (like, jolted, IDK how to explain). Like I am shaky almost and the fact of getting so little sleep made me more anxious and mad (because sleep is a HUGE GOAL OF MINE and I took steps yesterday to achieve it, and I NEED it now because I have a fever, and it is JUST NOT COMING TO ME).   
I am so frustrated and desperate and feel at my wits ends, and I'm scared I will have some health crisis  (either immediately or in the future) from lack of sleep and age prematurely and get ugly and old quickly and even now I'm on the verge of tears but I can't bring myself to cry lol. Like I am so envious of people who can sleep 8+ hours and I feel they will be more attractive than me and it's an uphill climb and makes me want to scream because even when I feel like I do things that SHOULD BE conducive to sleep, my body simply will not. But I understand that stress about the stress is not helpful.  
More information about me: I am 22F, I do exercise at the gym (but I want to more, currently it's at 3-4x a week, and in fairness yesterday I didn't exercise, but I was sick). I do drink 2 coffees a day and a tea but I to limit these to at least before 5pm. I do have history of trauma and anxiety, which may account for some of this -- my BF has pointed out that the joltedness seems consistent with being stuck in fight or flight / adrenal fatigue. I do not smoke, drink, or do any drugs.  
The task seems insurmountable and I really really need someone to tell me this is fixable. I feel so alone and scared. Idk I really can't express my degree of desperation. Especially now, because my body is sick, and NEEDS rest more than ever, and simply is not cooperating.. It is so scary to feel like I'm doing the ""right things"" (meditating, blindfold, fan) and still not sleeping. In fairness, meditating I don't do every day, and I do use screens before bed, but the alternative to me seems to be lying awake for 8+ hours with existential dread and a crazy heart rate while the world is asleep and no one can help me.   
Things I tell myself to self-soothe:  
(1) it is fixable! You have slept before well and you will again.   
(2) feeling like you're doing everything to sleep, but still using screens at night, means you haven't exhausted all options -- and that's a good thing! You just need to find ways to self-soothe and/or sit with the anxiety at night without youtube or social media distracting you.  
(3) it will be a cumulative effect/learned skill -- once you sleep well once, you will not stress that ""oh this is permanent,"" which may reduce nighttime anxiety the next night and so on...  
(4) you often sleep LATE (college grind..) like 4am-10:30am so maybe when you try to sleep at 11PM the body is just confused. Have mercy on yourself and be patient.  
(5) sleeplessness is amplifying the feelings of fear and anxiety. Those will also decrease when you rest.  
Any other thoughts??? Again I can't tell you how scared I am lol like I am considering going to the hosptial to ask if they can help induce me to sleep I don't even know"

Is it bad I think I deserve this as punishment for being. A bad person? I don‚Äôt know my brain is scattered. I‚Äôm genuinely terrified I‚Äôm living my last days or I‚Äôve already died,, nobody I know irl has actually sat me down and talked with me about anxiety because they don‚Äôt really believe in it so it‚Äôs just nice to hopefully find people who understand I won‚Äôt say what sickness I fear I have in this post to not trigger people but, I‚Äôm sorry non the less this post is probably a waste of time  I also feel nauseous and bloated a lot unable to pass gas‚Äôs or poop a lot, so idk I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôve also been seeing black dots? And it makes me really scared sometimes and sometimes it doesn‚Äôt bother me I also feel sick but not sick? It‚Äôs hard to explain and then my eyes burn sometimes too"

432,I‚Äôm so fed up!!!!!!,"This is mostly to vent but I need to do it somewhere so here I am 

I am absolutely so fed up with my anxiety right now. The obsessive thoughts, the waves of panic, the constant hyper awareness of potential dangerous body sensations. It has completely slid my perception of reality from being happy and content to being constantly on the search for danger. Most days feel like I have to perpetually have my guard up in the case of a medical emergency. I will survive each panic attack again and again, tell myself on loop that it‚Äôs just anxiety, but still be an anxious mess about a similar theme the following day. I constantly worry about death- it‚Äôs been so horribly hard to just enjoy the present moment. I have no idea what to do with myself. Even things that are recommended to help, like taking a walk or doing yoga, feel so scary to do alone. I don‚Äôt want to take medication, I‚Äôve been in therapy for a few months but I‚Äôm still effectively a shell of a human being, and it makes me so so sad. It‚Äôs been a long time since I haven‚Äôt felt disturbed. I just want it to end and I don‚Äôt want to ever experience something like this again. I feel like a prisoner to my own thoughts sometimes. It‚Äôs so sad. Any positive sentiments or advice or support is appreciated, could use it. :(

434,Leaving a place where I feel anxious,"Been feeling a lot of anxiety about my anxiety recently. I had a couple of incidents where I had to leave social gatherings because I felt very anxious. Now, because I'm scared that this will happen again I put my self into the spiral of going somewhere with anticiptory anxiety, which than gets me actually anxious. I do, however, force myself to go places where I'm scared I will experience anxiety. But I still get anxious after a while and go back home. Is it ok to go home or should I push through that feeling?

Public speaking makes me so anxious that I start talking super fast and physically feel bad. I‚Äôve tried everything and nothing is helping with this.

It sucks because i know its just pseudo anxiety, like there's no real reason for me to be this pedantic about taking medication prescribed to me but its still hard for me to rationalise with myself. I'm on lexapro which is kinda helping but i still feel stuck with this."

438,Timing to inform Therapist about Medical Changes,"Here's the basic information: 2 days ago I had a panic attack. Rare for me but whatever. I used my resources and got through it ok with some stress and muscle pain that was lingering on till the next day. Yesterday I left work early because of briefly blacking out, chest pains, and tremors. A family member took me to Urgent Care and the doctor said it was an anxiety attack. My first ever. I knew before I went it could be anxiety caused but I was scared and didn't feel right. Honestly if the Dr. told me I had a minor heart attack I would have believed them. I had never felt that way before. None of this is ideal but fine cool whatever. I can get help and deal with it.

My question is this: I don't meet with my therapist till Friday. Is this something I should inform her of now? I will be informing her either in my session or in our messages ahead of the appointment.

My concern with telling her now is her telling me that my case and my anxiety is more than she is capable of handling and cutting care. If that (admittedly worst case scenario) happens then I don't know what to do. These therapy appointments are one of the things I anticipate all week. They keep me going.

Edit: I just messaged them now anyways to avoid the anxiety of putting it off. If this blows-up in my face that's fine. I know I tried my best."

At work, at the mall, even my SO does this.

Honestly, I know I'm not crazy. This is legit happening.

If ya'll could humor me at least, instead of telling me I'm just paranoid, how the fuck are people doing this?

An example: I was talking to a person who's living with me, I felt like he was insinuating that he knew what I had been doing on my phone. To test this out I wrote on Google some insults (called him a f*ggot essentially) and the dude was flipping out and he called me a f*ggot lol. Not to my face granted, but within earshot of me and his body language was hostile. Dude didnt want to talk to me for a while afterwards.

441,Anxiety causing heart palpitations and not letting me sleep,I‚Äôve been dealing with anxiety for a while now but recently I‚Äôve struggled tremendously with trying to manage it. I‚Äôd wake up feeling lightheaded and feeling the back of my head and lower neck/upper back pounding. My DR thinks it‚Äôs tension headaches caused by anxiety and stress since I‚Äôm still in my 20s. He prescribed me some ibuprofen and now while trying to sleep I‚Äôve felt even worse trying to fall asleep with the left side of my chest feeling hot alongside some heart palpitations keeping me awake while trying to sleep. I haven‚Äôt slept since yesterday and it‚Äôs like every time I try to close my eyes I‚Äôm just jolted back awake by my own heart. I‚Äôm just so exhausted and tired to deal with this on a regular basis. Any advice or help?
442,Just consumed way too much caffeine so I didn't fall asleep at work. How do I calm down?,Yea this is dumb bc this is the second time I've done this but I've been sent home from work for falling asleep before so I didn't want to look bad üò≠ my heart's pounding and I feel like weird 
443,Hit me with all your avoidance anxiety best routines/tips etc I need to beat this!,"I'm a avoidantholic. I work from home which makes avoiding things easy. I'm trying to heal, but the anxiety of doing certain tasks and things on my to do list is so overwhelming sometimes. Other times, I just can't stand the boredom and frustration. It's an emotional problem I know and I'm taking sertraline and I don't have adhd.

Any advice on how to finally deal with avoidance anxiety? What worked for you best?

444,Extreme sense of anxiety that‚Äôs impossible to explain ,"I‚Äôve started getting these weird episodes where I suddenly feel this sickening almost deja by esque trigger feelings? Again this feels next to impossible to try and explain. This crawling sensation up my back and shoulders, my hands feel cold and tingly. And it‚Äôs almost as if my brain feels nauseous rather than my stomach.  It‚Äôs just this terrible sense of complete an utter dread, unease and vileness. But it also has this awful dejavu feeling that makes it impossible to explain. 
These only ever come in short episodes, and distraction sometimes helps. But once it is over, it‚Äôs even harder to comprehend it.

I‚Äôve tried my best to explain this but I understand it may also just seem like nonsense. Is this anxiety? My health anxiety sometimes panics if it‚Äôs actually something really serious. Would love to hear your thoughts. "
445,Feeling judged by doctors,"This situation is a bit ironic, but I booked a doctor‚Äôs appointment a couple of weeks in advance to talk about anxiety/depression symptoms that I‚Äôve been dealing with lately. However, due to certain circumstances I was feeling slightly better and decided to cancel the appointment and was concerned I would be wasting their time and something about going there makes me feel uncomfortable so I try to avoid it where I can.

Anyway, I unexpectedly received a phone call asking me where I was, and I replied immediately saying I had already cancelled it on an app they used. They told me that it hadn‚Äôt come through on their system so essentially I was a no-show. I had not replied to an automated message due to thinking the app covered it.. The receptionist then was quite short/blunt and said she would tell the doctor I didn‚Äôt need it anymore and more or less hung up pretty abruptly.

Now, ironically I feel more anxious again and can‚Äôt properly calm down over my fear of being an annoying patient. I say this as a health professional myself which actually makes me feel more pressure to act calm and collected. Also I have known this doctor for a long time and feel I have displayed some behaviours in the past that would be considered mildly entitled/annoying, but I don‚Äôt think I was trying to do so on purpose. I remember I had apologised to this doctor when I was much younger for being rude previously and they told me they didn‚Äôt even remember, so I don‚Äôt think they are upset at me, I just know in myself I am overthinking it but I regret not going now..

It‚Äôs not possible to book another appointment now for other reasons so I just have to sit with this feeling for now. I already see a therapist for these issues. Just wanting to rant a little!"
446,"People dealing with severe late onset GAD, do you remember how it is to feel normal?","I‚Äôve always had anxiety issues since I was a child but 2 1/2 years ago in my mid 40, severe GAD was triggered. Even on ‚Äúgood‚Äù or ‚Äúvery good‚Äù days, I still don‚Äôt feel 100% normal - like I used to. While I can still laugh and enjoy myself I‚Äôm still tense, I still get the occasional jab in my chest, tightness in my jaw, feeling or doom, or like a trapped animal.

I know it‚Äôs not very long but for 2 1/2 years every day has been FFF. 

I cannot remember how it is to not feel lightheaded because I‚Äôm hyperventilating. Or the aforementioned sensations, palpitations - to feel nothing but a relaxed body. 

When I open my eyes in the morning the PVCs and adrenaline already starts, and the nausea, and well ‚Ä¶ hell.

Do any of you have ‚Äúdays off‚Äù from your demon? Do you remember how it feels to relax on the couch or in the beach without thinking when is the next panic attack going to come? I don‚Äôt. 

Bit of a funny ‚Ä¶last summer while visiting my homeland i went to a favorite place from my childhood - my family‚Äôs village. I‚Äôm at the very edge of the village and there‚Äôs nothing. but fields and woods and serenity. There‚Äôs a Levi there, and i found this spot that‚Äôs kinda shaped like a Herman miller chair (lol yes), and i sit down in it in the tall grass, and lay back. Taking in the fresh country air and listening to the birds sing and smelling the green chestnuts on the tree nearby. I had a moment of a few minutes where I completely relaxed. Then this asshole comes along on the road at the top of the Levi and says ‚Äúhey watch out there are ticks in the grass‚Äù. SOB!!!  6 minutes of peace and this asshat came and ruined it. Oh well. That was in July. I haven‚Äôt felt that again since."

451,Silent panic attack?,"I‚Äôve (21F) been diagnosed with aniexty for a few years now. I had had what I thought was panic attacks in the past, but now I think they were more aniexty attacks I could tell I was panicking and making it worse at those moments so I didn‚Äôt think much of it. It has been a while since anything like that happened. 

Today I had a rough day. Gave plasma, got home just so irritated. Hugrey and pissy. But I cooled off. So later the same day I go to smoke weed with my sister. I am an experienced smoker, used to have my medcard(now expired) , and smoke twice a day, and usually I am fine or even less anxious after smoking. So we finish smoking maybe 10 minutes after I just feel lightheaded. I‚Äôve always been a faint girl, so that wasn‚Äôt a big thing. But I felt lightheaded, I started not being able to really hear, just ringing, I felt like I was about to pass out. 

So I go to sit in my room and my sister follows me to try to help. I‚Äôm just sitting there I could do really anything. It was very scarey. It was so vivid so harsh so severe, I‚Äôd never felt this faint before in my life. I couldn‚Äôt hear a thing my whole body was sweating. I just felt numb. My eyes were closed and I was leaning my head against my sister and all I could see was white. 

In my head for a moment I did think I was going to die cause I‚Äôm over hear thinking I‚Äôm seeing the light like this is gonna be my last day. I was just breathing just trying to breath cause that‚Äôs all I could really do. Eventually it passed over me like a wave but I still felt very bad I felt like I was going to shit myself so then I‚Äôm like running to the bathroom and I just sat in there for a while. 

After I ate some food and felt better. Later the same day, like right before bed, we are smoking again, and I feel this coming on AGAIN. Not nearly as strong just barely anything compared to it. So why am I typing all this? I want to know if any of you guys have experience like this? Was this a silent panic attack? Was I just faint cause of the plasma? Or maybe a combo of both. Any advice comments just info appreciated"
452,Tell me about the first time you remember feeling anxiety. ,"I‚Äôll tell you mine. I was about 6 years old. The neighbours dog escaped and my brother chased the dog around down the street.

For a year after, I wouldn‚Äôt let my brother out of my eyesight.

455,Do you have any of these?? ,"Hi fellow sufferers, do you have any of these???

Here are some of my experiences that im going through, suffering from anxiety disorder trigggered by severe burnout. Do you recognize any of them, some of them or most of them? Are we in the same boat? ü´∂


1. Trying to deal with constant dissapointments is exhausting: you might be ok in the evening but you wake up feeling horrible again, or you feel ok in the morning but suddenly in the afternoon the anxiety hits hard. And on and on. 

2. Your thoughts are mainly focused on yourself, on your mental and physical sensations, cant really take any interest in others anymore. You stare but your lizard brain is doing its own thing ruminating.

3. Sometimes you feel so bad anxiety that you dont know if you going insane, need to hit something, or hit yourself. 

4. Sometimes the anxiety feels like a black heavy ball in the upper stomach just growing and growing, and you dont know if you should puke, cry or scream to get it out. For me ive noticed that crying helps.

5. Feels like you are in a never ending nightmare rollercoaster, from good to bad moments. And nobody can say when this rollercoaster ends so you just have to sit and wait. And try to trust that this too shall pass.

6. Being afraid of ‚Äùwhat if someday I just cant deal with it anymore‚Äù

7. Hiding sharp knives cause they scare you because you weirdly think that ‚Äùwhat if i get so bad i hurt myself‚Äù

8. Although people / therapist say you getting better slowly but slowly is too slow for you and you dont think you getting better at all except on good day you might feel different. On good days you feel some trust in getting better, a ray of hopefulness and then the bad moment hits and you feel defeated and hopeless again.

9. Constant fight between hope and hopelessness

10. Cant really take a good nap anymore cause afraid you wake up with worse anxiety

11. Trying to avoid news cause the only things you hear / pick up are headlines about scary mental health things (‚Äùxx commited suicide‚Äù‚Äùdepression so bad nothing helped‚Äù etc). Getting huge anxiety surge everytime. Thats your brain trying to find ‚Äùdanger‚Äù

12. Often thinking how you feel must be worse than anybody elses anxiety makes them feel and that there must be some other bad/worse mental health issue you actually have that nobody has yet picked up on (even if your do tor/therapist say it is anxiety/gad, many many times). You just cant believe that anxiety can make you feel so awful, scared, doomed etc. Sometimes you feel you must be ‚Äùpoisoned‚Äù

13. Seeking reassurance online, reading other peoples experiences, trying to find ‚Äùsuccess stories‚Äù how somebody who felt like you now has become better. 

14. Being fixated in reading about possible meds for anxiety, and of course the stories about side effects that then scare you so much you cant start any. Then you feel trapped, cause you dont feel good but you too scared to try a possible cure.

15. spending too much time online, picking up only the sad or scary or negative things about mental healt or medications, stress levels go higher, followed by bad sleep and next morning worse anxiety.

16. Feels like no matter how many time you read the stuffs about anxiety disorder, and how much you know about it, gone through it, the lizard brain just goes on and on to find more/read more and in the end the most you remember is are the bad stuffs youve read (Ive even blocked some pages, blocked search engines but nothing helps cause i just override them üòÖüòÖ 

I really wish the best to all of you who go through anxiety or have gone through it, Thanks for discussing üåπ

456,Trapped In a closed shell created by myself,"Hi 22(m) here from India. I want to say that i was kind of innocent and gullible in childhood but still got along with classmates and kids of my age thts what i used to think but it wasn't like that thing is my classmates were mostly Gujarati and i was hindi speaking but was born and bought up in gujarat so i can read write and speak gujarati fluently thanks to gujarati subject in school my school was coed but girls were kinda boring back then and were unnecessarily loud and annoying, boys were froming groups based on acedemics and sport and i was average in both so i had no common ground to make friends to socialize
But luckily still managed to make few friends but they left around 6-7 std and some in 10th basically as i am introspecting now i realized i never put effort not even approached them might be sharing lunch was enough to initiate the conversation but neither they are significant to me nor i am for them 

Same goes with college friends but I've struck upon thought that i am never investing enough in any relationship be it with my parents or sister like my efforts are negligible compared to them tho as a man i have sense of responsibility towards them and can't live without them coz they love me so much

This guilt has made me take care of them and support them which has improved our relationship but i still sometimes think that need some personal space where im not being a son or brother but myself which im unable to communicate with them sometimes I can't articulate my thoughts in words 

also many times i feel like im loosing friends because ive never done any favours never went out of way to help them 

Heck even never approched them for first time except for making group project like first time when i approached a guy in college to get involved in their project group as they were makin best presentation in class rest of my friends have initiated conversation with me made me their friends earned my trust and maintaining friendship they even take stand for me when i need and are very caring snd understanding 

But like in past id snitched in a situation and lied here and there to like avoid doing any favours (don't know right word for it ) like i scare to get close enough or overshare with any friends and kind of unable to trust anyone 

Will i be ever come out my shell to live fully coz i feel lonely here none to talk and ive nothing to talk either aside from small talks to any of my friends like i said earlier i am not a good person either and don't have a communication skills and can't socialize easily 

Please someone help me with this situation as it's affecting my career too I can't say no easily thus i lie can't do well in that either and get caught have no negotiation skills mostly get scammed by sellers

I know it's common problem and can be worked upon but feeling stuck is giving me anxiety about will i be able to get over it it's almost suffocating "

465,Embarassed of my performance anxiety,"I am a latino and how I grew up is is basically the idea that there isn‚Äôt such a thing as a mental health problem and you need to just suck it up. I never really was taught how to handle my anxiety except to just liven up and never talk about it. Anytime I get anxious my throat drys up and I get really tongue tied, and I feel a rush of blood and throbbing in my head. I mostly get this when I have to do stuff in front of people and the most of the attention is on me. I try my best to avoid situations where the attention is on me for this reason. I hate presentations and public speaking. I feel like I am going to make a fool out of myself. I recently got hired onto a job where I have to perform certain tasks in front of a group of people and I had to perform certain tasks in front of them today and I was starting to feel really anxious and felt super tongue tied and dry throat and I was shaking and shivering and messing up the task and acting weird. I feel like I embarrassed myself. When I got hired everybody seemed so lively, funny and nice and buddy buddy and I wanted to fit in. I don‚Äôt want to bring a negative mood and my anxiety into there and I feel ashamed and embarrassed, even though I know I shouldn‚Äôt but I can‚Äôt help but feel ashamed of being anxious when rationally this isn‚Äôt something to get anxious over.

471,Head and neck pressure ,"(Tagged in case this is triggering) 

I‚Äôve been experiencing head and neck pressure for a while now that comes and goes. The best way to describe it is that it feels like the blood vessels in my head and neck are going to pop. It is not inherently painful and I‚Äôm not experiencing any headaches or migraines with it. I also get dizzy when the pressure comes. Currently, it is constant and certain positions can aggravate it like laying on my stomach, bending down, etc. I also feel pressure/clogged feeling in my ears. 

I was in the ER a month ago and got a head CT scan and EKG and everything seems fine besides my blood pressure being a bit high which the doctor brushed off as anxiety. I was ‚Äúdiagnosed‚Äù with vertigo that day but the motion sickness medications they prescribed did nothing for me. I have to wait till April to see a primary care doctor about all these symptoms since my insurance changed at the start of the year. 

Should I be worried about these sensations? I don‚Äôt know if I can hold off till April without having to go to the ER again for peace of mind (it‚Äôs just way too expensive). I have health anxiety so I made the mistake of googling my symptoms and I‚Äôm convinced I have POTS or a CSF leak or something. I‚Äôm also worried it might be vascular and that my neck arteries are holding on for dear life. Can anyone relate?

472,I will get to sleep tonight feeling good ,"I just finished a call with a funny cute wholesome women and i feel pretty good for keeping conversation going for a while(even with my anxiety having its effect on me).

I didn‚Äôt let it dictate my night and would actually go to bed feeling pretty much proud for this accomplishment. 

I know it may be something small but for me the meaning behind fighting back such thoughts that would ruin my life brings back hope to me again. Makes me feel i could fight stronger anxious thoughts online or even in real life conversation. This glimpse of hope have been missing for quite a while now which bought back depression into my life. But that all doesnt matter ,even tho i didnt get to choose having social anxiety but i get to choose how i let it affect my life.

473,My anxiety is so severe even Ativan doesn‚Äôt work.,"29m. I have the worst anxiety and panic disorder you will ever see. This is not an exaggeration. I woke up at 5am and had a full blown anxiety attack and several full blown panic attacks until 1pm. I believe I collapsed from exhaustion and fell asleep for maybe 20 minutes.

Sleeping is like a reset button for my anxiety. A long and deep sleep will keep my anxiety low for the next hour or two after I wake up, but within 30 minutes it was back full force. I took 0.5mg of Ativan. One hour later, nothing. So I took another. One hour later, no difference.

I am going insane and am in agony. Not a day goes by without this happening. If it wasn‚Äôt obvious, I‚Äôm disabled, can‚Äôt leave home, can‚Äôt take care of myself, and can no longer leave my bed. These horrific episodes of anxiety and panic all day every day seemingly happen for no reason. I have lost everything because of it."
474,several days long anxiety attacks?,"It started last Friday, I felt this slight tightness in my chest & got lightheaded around noon & went home early from work.

Same thing happened again at a restaurant while getting lunch the next day.

Then, Sunday, it happened again around noon after playing pickleball & got in the car on our way to brunch. I felt lightheaded in the car & out of sorts. My vision then started to get black (tunnel vision). So I went to the ER, while in the waiting room I started to have difficulty breathing & I told the nurse & he took my blood pressure & he thinks I was hyperventilating.

The doctor ultimately told me I have low phosphorous levels & prescribed oral tablets to take for a day, which I did. CT Scan, bloodwork, EKG, X-Ray came back normal otherwise.

For the last 2 days I feel like I am on the edge of a panic attack & I have to constantly work to suppress my thoughts. Even though the tests are normal, I still feel like something's somewhat wrong with me. But when I think that, I start to panic again.

When this happens, I feel difficulty breathing like my lungs are deflated. I feel slight tightness in my chest & sometimes brief sharp pains in my chest, wooziness & lightheadedness.

I don't have a doctor & the only ones available in my health insurance are booked out for a couple of months in my area. I was able to get one on Mar 11 but it's kind of far away.

I feel like this won't end & I have to constantly work to suppress it. When I start to think about my chest having some sort of issue, it happens again.

I feel like these are anxiety attacks. I have anxiety sometimes especially social anxiety, but I've never had attacks like these before. Even though I tell myself this is just anxiety & I'm 99% sure there's nothing wrong with me, it still doesn't go away. Is it supposed to last this long?

Just want to tell the story of my last handful of days. Just looking for any advice."

Does anybody else do this? Has anybody else felt this way from anxiety? Because this whole facial flushing and itching it and sporadic burning triggers is all new to me. I don't feel dread all the time but when I start feeling the warmth creeping and the itching creep in I start to get a lot of dread and worry"
480,Looking for advice. Please help,"I'm a 27 year old male. I was doing well in September when suddenly, I started feeling really dizzy, like everything was spinning. It was extremely intense at first, coming and going, and I figured out that alcohol and caffeine were triggers, so I cut them out. Over the past several months, things have improved a bit, but the symptoms are still hanging around. Now, it's more of a persistent lightheaded, imbalanced feeling. I've got this strange ringing in both ears, like the sound of an engine. Went to the emergency room a couple of times, did all the tests, but nothing conclusive. Interestingly, my blood pressure drops to 90/30 and my pulse can go as low as 32, though I‚Äôm not sure if it's not directly linked to the episodes. Trying to connect it to my activities or diet, but no luck. I saw an ENT, and they said M√©ni√®re‚Äôs disease and central labyrinthitis are unlikely, recommending that I see a cardiologist. Scheduled for that soon.

On top of all this, throughout this ordeal, I've experienced really heightened anxiety and have had terrifying panic attacks. I'm really struggling and I‚Äôm wondering if this persistent lightheaded, imbalanced feeling be the result of severe anxiety? I‚Äôm fearful this won‚Äôt get better and I‚Äôm truly despairing.  "

483,One of our patients left our clinic and I think it's because of me ( Front desk/receptionist),"Background: I work in a physiotherapy clinic as a front desk person. I'm the only person who works there at the front desk. Our clinic doesn't have that many patients. I joined the clinic 5 months ago and it is my first job aside from working fast chain.

The patient, who left the clinic, has been a patient at our clinic for a year now. When I first started I had to cancel his appointment because the therapist was sick, he was really upset and kinda mad. I did call him an hour or so before. He kept on saying he wanted his massage today no matter what and that he would be coming there soon. He said he wanted to talk with the owner and blah and blah. Somehow he calmed down and didn't come. The next time, he met me, he did apologize. So I decided to forget about the incident. Tbh, I was still kind of scared of him. Every single he had his appointment, I used to get extremely anxious (shaky hands, shivers and sweats). Whenever I assist at the back with the therapist, my hands will shake badly.

A couple of months later, I had to cancel his massage appointment again. I did call him an hour ago again. He was upset but he didn't start yelling at me this time. He said he would come in even tho there is no therapist there. He did came in. He was laughing and jokingly asked what he should do now ( multiple times). He kept insisting that he could drop me home today ( again multiple times). I told me that I would be fine on my own. I was getting a little annoyed by him so I might said something rude to him. Since he kept on insisting, I was starting to get creeped out. I am a huge overthinker so I think I might reading too much into it. In the end, he said that he was just joking and he was forcing me or something. He sat in our waiting room and talked with me for 45 minutes. He was upset about how he could have worked extra if I called him a bit earlier. I felt stupid about this and how I was letting people walk over me and have zero confidence in myself.

&#x200B;

Today, my coworker called me and said that he left for another clinic since the other clinic called to ask for his details about his insurance and treatments. Since he was with us for such a long time, it made her wonder why would he leave. It didn't happen with past front desk people. I might be overthinking or something. I do have a feeling that it could have been because I might have been a little rude last time.

This whole thing is making me nauseous. I don't have any friends or anyone I can share it with. I don't have any family here too. I am living entirely alone.  My anxiety has been bad lately and it's suffocating now. I just wanted to vent it out. Thank you for reading it.

484,What has you get through intense anxiety when you still have to work? ,"What are some tips that has helped you get through intense anxiety in the moment? I‚Äôm currently going through a lot of work/college stress where my anxiety goes from 5 to 10 every few days. I‚Äôm in my 2nd day of intense anxiety that I cant sleep and Im sobbing every hour. I usually try to seek reassurance /validation from my family but I feel like I can‚Äôt do that anymore since it‚Äôs been constant.

486,Anxiety been horrible after telling my story on podcast and it did horrible.,"I never had the chance to just process how much this damaged me so wanted to share about this experience here, so first off: I have very weird gross degrading experience with my parents not sexual just abusive/weird. But anyways I had to be very vulnerable on that podcast, it wasn't a big podcast just a podcast with some viewers they wanted to help me after hearing about my situation, but the damaging part was we never reached the goal which was to raise 10k, barely got views compared to their other episodes, I was really nervous throughout and dragged my words, but I can't even describe how damaging it was to me that barely anyone donated or showed support made me feel like my story and what I gone through didn't matter. Fine I'll share the details I shared about being forced to eat food my mom spit up out her mouth as punishment when I was 11, how I was forced to eat food in restroom infront of my sis diapers, my parents spitting in my mouth, and how my dad would do things to purposely anger me, being whooped with sex music on, things Like that and I just haven't been able to recover from sharing things like that and not get the support I needed, maybe wouldn't hurt so much if I wasn't still struggling with homelessness and if those same ppl that tried to help me didn't ghost me and cut me out of their life without any explanation, idk it hurts so much makes me feel like I'm a joke, I was treated like I was a joke by my parents and now life treats me like a joke just wish I was dead honestly."
487,Little rant for those who feel so inclined.,"I (M19) genuinely don't know how much more of this I can take. I have years of build up from repressed emotions from my childhood, my mother passing, the neglect, the emotional abuse and horrible experiences with drugs. How alone I was. I am experiencing severe anxiety, dpdr and agoraphobia to the point where I can't even step outside without having a panic attack and questioning my existence. And I've tried exposure therapy but sitting outside for like 30 min a day but it doesn't get easier. Only time I feel somewhat normal is when I'm locked into to music, movies or video games. And even then I struggle with that. I've had like 2 minutes of relief from this fucking hell. I can't get meds or therapy because of the agoraphobia, anxiety, dpdr.  
  
I've tried accepting these feelings and be like, ""This is temporary and you will get to live a happy, healthy life soon."" But that's usually short-lived and I go back to the existential thoughts surrounding my existence and thinking that I don't exist. I forget who and where I am every morning. I'm confused. Terrified and usually have a panic attack. I know this is all fueled by trauma and anxiety. My parents (Dad and Stepmum) are giving me shit for ""being lazy"" and ""Not leaving my room"" But this is the only place in the world where I feel as if I have some level of safety. I don't feel safe in my body. The hardest part of my day, and I'm not even kidding is leaving my room and eating dinner. It sounds insane but leaving my room feels like I'm going to go crazy or drop dead.  
  
I try sitting with my feelings, but it is so intense I can't handle it, that's why the DPDR is there. I have to remind myself that I exist, constantly.  
  
Anyway, I just needed to get this off my chest, have a good one :)"

For example today I was in english and I was crying because I thought my paragraph was terrible and that I was so behind, after class my teacher said its actually really good and she had no doubt that I can do it. I remember in history I was the top of my class, I studied so much I answered all the questions until when I went to sleep my dream was just doing history but I still cried after the test because I thought it wasn‚Äôt good enough.

494,I take Klonopin daily. It's the only thing that truly helps.,"I saw a post from earlier today about klonopin but it was locked. Many comments demonized benzo use, as usual. It's basically if Satan and Hitler had a baby and converted it into a tablet.


I've take a low dose of Klonopin essentially daily for many years now. I've posted about it here before but not in awhile. I've posted my story, which I'll briefly tell again:


Anxiety forever due to I believe genetic reasons and bullying growing up. Depression was there as well. In 2013 it boiled over into panic attacks and I've never been the same. I believe it was due to personal stress + first responder stress + financial stress + alcohol abuse + high caffeine intake.


Since then I've tried two dozen mental health medications for my symptoms which are anxiety, depression, brain fog, OCD and such. SSRIs helped take the edge off but chronic anxiety remained right beneath the surface. These other meds caused many other side effects from sexual dysfunction to weight gain to exacerbation of dissociation and anhedonia. I've even tried Spravato, which was tedious.


Additionally I've tried other avenues. Therapy (on number 4), supplements (Ex: L-Theanine, Taurine, probiotics, Lithium Orotate, methylfolate, and much more), hormone therapy (diagnosed low T and am on TRT), meditation, and more.


Klonopin is the only thing that helps adequately. I don't feel GREAT and still suffer daily, especially with dissociation, but klonopin makes it more tolerable. I try to not take it and power through and I regret it every single time. So what're my choices? Take it and live a more tolerable life so I can work, be present for my family, and be able to merely go shopping without feeling super dizzy and disoriented OR suffer? 


I don't abuse it recreationally, nor have I ever. I don't use illicit drugs. I don't use marijuana. I don't drink alcohol. I just want klonopin and to use it as prescribed without being demonized by others. I don't even take my full dose of .5mg, I usually take a half in the morning and maybe another quarter or half mid day as needed.


I dont think it should be the first plan of attack on anxiety, I get that. But when someone has exhausted the ""safer"" options then this should be allowed without question. How medications pcer the past decade went from them being thrown at you with ease to being super strict isn't OK. For example, pain meds. I had spine surgery and they gave me 4 pain pills.


So please don't judge."
495,Advice please!,"I (22F) have struggled with severe anxiety my whole life. I feel like it controls everything I do. From the way I sleep, work, etc. Right now I feel like it is worse than ever.

500,Health anxiety surrounding migraines,"
Hi everyone. I have a ton of health anxiety and for the past 2 months I‚Äôve been getting which is told by my optometrist and ophthalmologist that it‚Äôs occular migraines. I‚Äôve never had migraines in my entire life and the first time I had it I saw a spot (like looking at the sun for too long) that grew into a brighter spot in my peripheral vision. This lasted about 15 mins and I felt fine after. 

Since then, this has seemed to be a weekly occurrence. The same thing happens everytime. However, 2x the left side of my face felt numb. And only 1x it happened in my right eye (usually left), and then the left eye an hour later. Sometimes I get a headache after but it‚Äôs not too often. If anything I feel foggy sometimes but then other times I‚Äôm fine after. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs just my anxiety adding to it. It also seems to be occurring in only one eye which I‚Äôve read is a retinal migraine and more rare. This made me worry more. 

I am 22 and not on any birth control pill, just have an IUD. My doctor told me they are usually nothing to worry about but he is concerned about the frequency I am getting them at so I am getting an MRI next week. Until then, I am freaked out, can‚Äôt stop googling, and always thinking the worst. Has anyone been through this and can anyone reassure me? I tried to figure out many triggers and can‚Äôt seem to find what it is. I‚Äôve paid close attention to caffeine, diet, exercise, sleep, stress (which I thought was the main cause since this happened before I moved across the country and started a new job). However, I‚Äôm not always stressed when it happens and have been more stressed before. I even started taking magnesium which I thought would help but I still get them. I don‚Äôt know what to do! "

508,Really don't feel comfortable to relocate for an internship.,"I am a 22F and an engineering student in Texas and I have been dealing with a lot of employers at career fairs and LinkedIn. Even though I understand the importance of an internship and how it's kind of compulsory for you to get a full time job, I am absolutely terrified at the thought of relocation. I know its only for 3 months but a lot of internships open are in other states. Heck I am even scared to move away from my city.

I live with my parents and wouldn't want it another way. I have had the nastiest form of anxiety since the past 2 years where I would have panic attacks sitting in a classroom and palpitations while lying down. I am trying to get over this now by taking more on-campus classes, focusing on learning, and talking to people. But just as I am working slowly to feeling better, jobs and internships have come giving me stress and anxiety again and hard. I cannot even think of living alone in a new city, I will not be able to learn anything and just be in a survival mode. I don't know what to do? I really really don't want to move but I also don't want my career to be a failure. 

There a lot of opportunities about 40 mins from where I am but just like other internships, they also have a lot applicants. If someone approaches me with a opportunity to apply to an out-of-state location, I feel like a jerk for not applying but at the same time not having the courage to apply. Has anyone been in this situation before? What did you do?

509,Can Barely Go To School (Creepy Men On Campus),"I am scared to go outside alone.

A bit of background; I (18f) live with my boyfriend and am attending university in a small city after living in a small town.

i am a generally nervous person, I have high anxiety and have never felt safe outside alone at night. 

Since we have moved recently I have been terrified to go anywhere alone including the bus (this is minimally attributed to another situation) but obviously I am alone on campus throughout the day and have had 3 unsettling instances this month.

1) My boyfriend goes on the bus with me to class everyday, the other day the bus didn‚Äôt have two seats next to each other so we sat apart. While the bus was moving, a man got up from his seat, he had a seat and then got up walked over to me and motioned like he wanted me to stand up and then leaned on top of me. He got off at the same stop as me.

2) I was sitting in a common area studying at a table in the corner. There was a group of men (40s or 50s) and one repositioned his chair to be on a diagonal when I sat down. Over the next hour, each time I looked up this man was staring at me which was made weirder by the fact that he was engaging in conversation with 3 others and wasn‚Äôt making eye contact with them.

3) I had 2 back to back classes and had to rush across campus, when I was walking to my second class I noticed a guy I had seen earlier was walking behind me. He followed me into the building of my second class and then walked away. I didn‚Äôt think much of it until I left class and went to buy some pens and he was sitting at a table facing me when I walked out. The last straw was when I went to get a coffee and 5 minutes after I sat down he sat next to me. I called my boyfriend and went to my next class and had him pick me up.

It is a continuos cycle where if I feel sick my anxiety rockets up, or if I feel anxious my nausea gets really bad. It‚Äôs like at this point if my nausea went and didn‚Äôt come back, I‚Äôd actually be able to cope with the anxiety and combat it!!

I struggle to eat properly every day and feel really deflated and horrible. I try to avoid leaving the house as I worry that I‚Äôll feel sick and be sick (I have emetaphobia). Stupidly I‚Äôve also never been sick due to anxiety, only ever if I have had a stomach bug. 

This feeling constantly on a daily is really draining me and I feel myself giving up. My boyfriend is really supportive and caring, but I can‚Äôt help the intrusive thoughts of ‚Äúhe‚Äôll get bored eventually and leave‚Äù. I feel like my family really want me to get better and I try, but non stop let them down. I miss my old life. Anxiety free and I did everything!

I was prescribed cyclizine and it was the only thing that helped my nausea. It just sucks as I know I shouldn‚Äôt take a pill like that daily. I have almost become dependent on it and take it whenever I need to. 

Has anyone got any advice? I could explain so much more, but it would just become a book! I just need help on how to stop this nausea long term and be able to get on with my life again. I am desperate to keep my relationships with my friends and especially my amazing boyfriend. Anyone that can help it will change my life honestly! Thank youüôèüèºüôèüèº"

I'm 31, and my colleague is 59, she has always been toxic towards the younger people, she's miserable and jealous. The last two times I've seen her she says that I look tired. 

The first time I didn't mind but this time it's really upset me and I honestly feel she's trying to upset me. Especially as I got up and made me self presentable today, like I thought I looked good!

I've already put things into place because of her toxic behaviour, I've reduced my contact with her. And I put headphones on so she can't drag me into conversations. 

Like I said, she's toxic and always has been, but she's never attacked my physical appearance.

My plan next week, if she says it again, is to tell her that ""I'm not tired, this is the way I look"". I will say that to her as I know until I do she'll continue it. 

But I just feel really sad and anxious about it. Part of me wants to go into tomorrow to get it over and done with.  I don't want to put in a complaint or anything I will add that.

Anyway, any advice/support is welcomed x

Edit: I was so anxious I came into work today and confronted her. I first told her that she looked tired, and she was insulted by this response, I could see it on her face that she wasn't happy with what I'd said.

516,i [F 19] don‚Äôt understand my anxiety ,"i‚Äôve never heard of anyone experiencing anxiety the way i do and i just wanna find other people like me who can offer me some advice. 

My anxiety doesn‚Äôt seem like everyone else‚Äôs versions of anxiety. My anxiety feels more like a physical reaction rather than mental. I could be so happy and excited and nothings wrong but my chest and stomach area feel anxious. Anxiety for me doesn‚Äôt feel like an emotion. Most times I cant pin point where, when, and how i started feeling anxious, just all of a sudden i am. I‚Äôm not scared to go outside or talk to people. i‚Äôm not afraid of something happening in the future. i‚Äôm not overthinking things. Well not always at least. My anxiety is 1000% worse when i have something to focus on. Like a test question i know i got wrong, or a vacation coming up, or if i know someone‚Äôs upset with me or if i‚Äôm upset with someone. which makes sense , that‚Äôs the normal anxiety i hear of. but majority of the time, it feels like there‚Äôs genuinely no reason and i just feel sick. I think it‚Äôs why for so long I didn‚Äôt think i actually had GAD because it  came in waves and there would be weeks where i won‚Äôt be anxious at all and then all of a sudden it comes back EVEN THO NOTHING HAPPENED. people keep advising me to be aware of what my triggers are and to understand why i feel anxious but it genuinely feels like there is no reason, even tho i‚Äôm told there is always a reason

Does anyone get what I mean? And how do i fix it? "
517,helpful tips for return to office anxiety? ,"hey all my first time posting here! my job is calling for us to go back to office 3x a week. I've been at this job for over 2 years now and I have gone into the office here and there but never as consistently as this.

519,Does anyone else think their anxiety has something to do with sinus/head inflammation?,"From the very first panic attack I had that triggered the last 3 years of anxiety I had, I've always felt like brain inflammation or sinus inflammation is an underlying cause of mine specifically and have heard similar but sporadic stories from others online. My anxiety came out of nowhere and I didn't have a history of any mental illness and wasn't even experiencing any stress at the time I had my first panic attack (that triggered my GAD). I just woke up in the middle of the night with a crazy panic attack and couldn't breathe through my nose. When I feel anxiety, my sinuses are almost always closed/inflamed and I have that sinus pressure feeling behind my eyes and above the roof of my mouth and brain fog/head in a daze feeling like someone hooked up an air compressor to my head. But never have any green sinus discharge or mucous or anything like that. I also haven't had any neurological symptoms indicative of a brain tumor either. And it's not just an anxiety/hypochondriac symptom either, my nose literally almost whistles when I try to breathe through it when I have anxiety. I've even shoved an ear inspection camera up my nose to look at my upper nasal passage when I feel anxiety and when I don't, and you can visually see the inflammation. 

Does anyone else feel this way? Sometimes, when I take a strong anti-inflammatory or even 2 advil, it helps with the anxiety too and makes me feel normal for a short period of time.

I have also tried Adderall (before the shortage) and felt like that SIGNIFICANTLY decreased the inflammation in my head. I almost enjoyed the anti-inflammatory aspect of it better than how it helped me get stuff done for my ADHD that I was also experiencing heavily at the time.

520,"I‚Äôve been having symptoms ever since I read about MS, could this really just be anxiety?","Hello, I‚Äôm a 21 year old male and about 2 weeks ago, I began having twitches all over my body.

525,"Anxiety due to hyperfixation on past mistakes, embarrassment and regrets","Hey guys! It's my first post here and I'm sorry that it's so long and it's a vent one, but I really felt like getting this off my chest and talking to someone who might have similar experiences.   
So, I (23, F) got diagnosed with GAD (generalized anxiety disorder) a bit after the pandemic, which was a horrible experience for me, as a close person passed away, and I felt very isolated.   
Basically I am having severe anxiety attacks over whatever my brain feels like it's time to get stressed over on that particular day (health, job, uni, family, friendships, etc) It has been a wild ride, but I've been working with a therapist for the past 2 years and things have definitely gotten better. However, lately I'm noticing a new pattern that won't go away and it's driving me crazy...  
Lately, I spend an immense amount of time and energy worrying about some of my past actions and feeling humiliated. Here are several random scenarios that are on the top of my head right now:    
\- About a time I treated a person badly in high school and said very nasty things to them because we fought. I regret how I acted towards them and apologized years later. I recently noticed they have removed me from all social media and I almost had a panic attack because I realized this person will always remember me as a horrible human being and probably will never forgive me.  
\- The time that an ex partner hurt me very much and treated me horribly, despite this I desperately tried to get back together with them, I realized months later that it was totally not worth it, I regretted doing that a lot, but what worries me is that person will forever remember how I called them, cried and begged and in their eyes I probably have no dignity.  
\- The time that I went to a birthday party and I had maybe a little too much to drink which made me bubbly and I overshared some personal information with a person that is not very close to me and I feel like I overwhelmed them and now they will forever remember this and also they could have told our mutual acquaintances about the personal stuff I shared.  
And more and more and more. The 'funny' thing is ALL of the things that I keep 'reliving' in my head happened at least 2 years ago, some are even from about 10 years ago! I don't speak to any of the people involved, they are not part of my life... And my life is actually going pretty good right now - I have been working on my own business, I started a great relationship with an amazing person, I am eating healthy, working out. The problem is whenever one of those thoughts occurs, it's preventing me from sleeping properly, eating, thinking about how I am a horrible human being and that everyone thinks so, and soon my new partner will notice it too, etc. It comes with all the usual symptoms (sweating, heart palpitations, crying, shaking.   
I'm having severe social anxiety where I postpone going out with people for weeks and I am panicking about posting on social media because I feel like someone would notice I posted and start discussing me and all of those things.  
   
When the anxiety wears off, I start seeing things more clear-minded, I realize that people don't care as much as my brain is forcing me to believe. I know that I am not some special person, I am not the center of anyone's universe, half of the things I am worrying about the other people involved have probably forgotten about or definitely don't think about it on a daily basis like I do. Or maybe they don't even think of it in a negative way. Maybe the person from high school was just clearing out their friend list and removing people they don't speak to. Maybe my ex partner realized that people sometimes act irrationally when they are emotional. Maybe the person from the party is actually glad I trusted them with some information or they were also drunk and forgot about all of it the next day. But for some reason I am convinced that everyone secretly hates me, discusses me behind my back, etc.

531,Exploring the Impact of the Proteus Effect on anxiety (cross post from /r/socialanxiety),"Hey everyone,  
  
I'm interested in how video games might potentially help us in managing our anxiety, especially through the lens of the Proteus Effect.  
  
To provide some context: the Proteus Effect suggests that users of virtual environments adapt their behavior to align with the characteristics of their respective avatars. And several studies have shown that such influence is also likely to shape individuals' behaviors outside of the virtual realm.  
  
Do you have any ideas for video games with avatar types that could specifically help us combat our social anxiety, boost our self-confidence, overcome our fear of assertiveness, and so on ( :p )?   
It's been a long time since I played video games, so I'm not really up to date with the latest releases XD.

My psych office will not prescribe them under *any* circumstances. The only anti-anxiety medication they give is hydroxyzine which is helpful for sleep and when I'm just on edge but if I'm deep in the panic throes they do nothing. My chest currently feels like its about to explode and I feel like there's nothing I can do but wait and hope it passes.

My old doctor gave me Klonopin under *very* strict controls (they were take as needed but I only got 10 a month and she would not give me any more until I finished those 10) and I almost never used them because I'm terrified of addiction, my best friend died ten years ago from an overdose so I'm extremely careful about this stuff? But the handful of times I did need it it was a lifesaver. (I actually think I still have a handful of them in a bottle somewhere because I never finished them but I'm sure they're ineffective by now it's been like 6 years)

I'm just frustrated. I hate being treated as drug-seeking for needing more help. I'm super lucky I've been diagnosed ADHD since I was a teenager or else I'm sure I'd suffer from this w/ my stimulants too."
535,Have you felt this way?  ,"
Have any new parents felt this way?

I‚Äôm a new user to this group. Please I ask to be gentle with your opinions or comments, as what I‚Äôm about to share is a sensitive topic to me at least and I‚Äôm working through it. Words of encouragement or your own experiences would be helpful.

I‚Äôll make try to make a long story short. I have had my first baby last year June and 8 months PP currently. I‚Äôve been an aunty for 12 years, and I‚Äôm so proud to be officially a mum to my own child even though he wasn‚Äôt expected. 

Ever since LO was born, his fathers side mostly, my husbands mom (late 60s) and sister(early 20s) always see my son more so his son and apart of their family then mine. His sister recently came to visit (as hubbys family lives a plane ride away) and some of her comments this time around acknowledging I‚Äôm my LOs mom.

I don‚Äôt have the best relationship with my husbands mom, and with his sister it has been  good in the past, but now being a mum I do feel I‚Äôm different; where relationships around me are different now as well.

I‚Äôm still going through the process of speaking up, feeling confident as my sons mum and our bond, as well as expressing my core emotions. 


However, I have been noticing after I FT with my husbands mom, during & after she visited back when I was 2 months PP, his sister visits also during & after my anxiety goes through the roof and it‚Äôs only with them.
I did have anxiety before getting pregnant, but it was more at bay and barley noticeable with my 5x a week workouts and working. Of course now that‚Äôs not really my reality for right now. 

I don‚Äôt know if I feel like this with them because of the comments they have said and I let slide, things they said, no actions don‚Äôt match with their word, if it‚Äôs from treatment from early PP, my boundaries not being understood.

It‚Äôs always thoughts of them trying to ice me out that comes to my mind and being worried about my bond with my LO, because it‚Äôs my husbands family first grandchild/nephew. So they don‚Äôt really know the possible function/boundaries we as a nuclear family may have and want respected. Which I understand the excitement, but so far when I have spoken up with the women at least it‚Äôs been a problem for them. They come off as I‚Äôm making a big deal and ruining their experience with their new title, when I do explain I‚Äôm trying to navigate my new experience as well; because we are not having anymore kids.

The anxiety goes away after a week maybe, but time to time I worry about my bond with my LO.

Have any others felt like this? Did it go away?

536,A positive story,"I've had severe anxiety since I was a child. I threw up almost every day and missed out on so many activities. I would have panic attacks during sleepovers, and before any social events. I missed a recital that I practiced so long for, but I couldn't stop throwing up. I had so many misdiagnoses' - even did a whole treatment for H pylori. Fast forward, I was put on Prozac when I was 13. The vomiting stopped, but the panic attacks didn't. They were less for sure. Then when I went to college, I developed a sort of agoraphobia. I couldn't eat out at restaurants, because I was so afraid I'd get sick. When I'd leave my apartment all I could think of was ""What if I get sick when I'm out and away from home?"" All this kind of stuff. I continued getting treatment and was eventually put on Paxil, which honestly is my biggest lifesaver. The other meds were not doing their job. I was also taking Klonopin twice a day... which helped. Weirdly, I never got addicted because it would simply get rid of my anxiety - I felt nothing else. Then after the age of 21/22, the attacks were less and less. Still had to take Klonopin though if I felt a panic attack coming on. Now I'm 30 and I haven't taken more than five Klonopins in the past 3 years. I can't say I never have panic attacks anymore, but they're so rare at this point. I think that age, CBT, meds and simply practicing mindfulness have allowed me to have a quality of life. I have friends now, I go out, I travel and I finally found purpose. There is hope! It only took me about 26 years. Still on meds with zero side effects, but everyone's different. "

543,Does anyone else find that their anxiety makes them overly sensitive to certain kinds of jokes?,"I have found that my anxiety (and possibly my ADHD as well, working with the anxiety) has made me more and more sensitive to particular jokes, even when they are not directed at me personally.

For me, the big one is jokes about my nationality. Every nationality has its jokes directed at it, usually involving stereotypes. I am sure we have all heard of ones for Americans, British, French, etc.

I grew up in a country where making fun of yourselves and being able to laugh along at self-deprecating humor from others is normal, and I do think it can be a good thing overall.

However my anxiety, especially over the last few years, has made me very sensitive to these kinds of jokes. I have always had a low self-esteem, and when I encounter such jokes on a seemingly regular basis online, it gets to me.

My anxiety tries to convince me that what I see and hear are not jokes, but honest opinions that are directed at me, and worse, that they are in the right in that I'm this weird person who does weird things and sounds weird etc., and that I should feel bad for being of this nationality, as if it were a conscious choice I was making, and am an idiot for being that way.

In essence, my brain acts as its own personal troll/hater/gaslighter. Especially as I know for a fact that I have never had any such honest opinions or comments thrown at me personally in my life. It really just sucks, for lack of a better way to put it. All it takes is one instance and that can be my day ruined as my brain gets stuck on it.

Naturally, I get really frustrated when this happens and feel defensive like I was actually being attacked or confronted by someone, but I don't get upset so much cause I think they are in the wrong, but because I KNOW it's all in my head. I can still recognize when something is meant as a joke or is an actual comment made out of negative opinions. This goes for everything and not just nationality jokes. I could be watching a live stream or meme video and I see someone, such as the streamer or a commenter, take a dig at my nationality if someone of my nationality showed up in, say, a meme.

I can tell that almost every time this happens there is no actual hate or mean spiritness involved and they make similar jokes for others, it's nothing personal.

But my brain just doesn't care and just sees it as fuel for the anxiety fire. This kind of reaction can happen for all sorts of things, I just wanted to bring up the jokes because that is where I have been feeling it the most recently. Honestly, I just can't see or be near any kind of arguments, confrontations, sensitive issues, controversies, and of course any 'poking fun at' type jokes etc., as the anxiety just gets going. It has made me too sensitive, far more than I would like to be and to the point it is life-restricting.

The best thing I can try to do is just avoid potential triggers, but you never know when it could happen so it is very difficult to do. I have tried many different tools and methods to block and hide such stuff, but no filter is perfect of course.

Sorry for the wall of text but I just really wanted to get this down somewhere. Does anyone else encounter this kind of thing?

I would really like to know as I often feel very alone with this particular reaction from my anxiety."

He has bailed on 2 dates. First date was for our 3rd and he said something didn't feel right. I said no and he said it was nerves. I panicked so much when I read that message. Sounded like it was over but maybe anxiety?
Then he got sick so we haven't seen each other for iver a week. We FaceTime. The past few days I've felt a bit down. Just a bit low energy, not as buzzy. Think I'm starting my period soon. He has been sick so we haven't talked alot the past week as he hasn't been up to much. We FaceTime today and it just didn't feel right. Idk how to describe it but It just felt off. It wasn't bad, alwkard yes but I find FaceTime awkard anyways.
I'm now worried we are doomed. I'm hoping it was an off day for us both. I just didn't feel a good spark between us like normal. I just felt a bit grey and dull. He said he doesn't believe I think I'm akward so I'm scared he thinks I'm a liar. I twll him I'm a big iverthinker but I think he think I'm being ""girlie"" when I'm actually huge worrier.

Like I have a silent panicked attack most days and I just annoy myself my repeating or replaying things or my head feels do Loyd and fuzzy and I'm scared Ill go crazy or I have gone crazy. 
I'm worried he's not I tetested anymore. He was telling me he wants me to meet his mum. The phone call was just but awkard and messy like he asked good questions and my answers made no sense and were shit. Idk what's wrong with me today I'm so so tired and feel down. I was interested in what he said but not too. I'm worried the relationship will go no where. 
Does the awkwardness go away? I'm on date 7? I wnay to ask him all tb3se questions and I don't feel natural sometimes. My mind goes blank and he asks good question. But the awkard silence is painful. Any tipics you can always talk about?
He's also super good looking and smart. I'm neither. I overthink I'm my head he is taking piss, the devil, a psycopath...but then I think I've made him up or I'm autistic as I mask my awareness in a facade and d9nt come across as anxious. And then I think I'm nor anxious I'm just making to fit in and then I'm not capable of emotions snd that now I've made this list to make me seem anxious when I'm not. 
I'm not sure.
I really like the guy but guess I worry as something felt off on phone call and texts recently  but idk I'd thats just me overthinking and picking up nothing. 
Any tips for insecure girls and sex? 
Tips to keep convo no matter what?
Just relationship tips?

547,Does anxiety influence how you connect to people?,"I have some pretty bad anxiety and I've rstarted doing some exercises for it everyday to figure out how it works, so I am able to talk about it better with my therapist.

Today I wanted to write, but it got me thinking about the various kinds of relationships out there, and how anxiety may play a role in various relationships.

So far, all of my current friends have been around for at least a full year or longer which for me, feels like an accomplishment because I didn't meet the right people until I was almost done with high-school and I started to think about what they may have in common.

This is probably different for everyone! I will say I am also autistic so this may very well just be an autism thing, but while reflecting on it, I realized I instantly felt connected as soon as I met them.

So now I'm wondering if anxiety can influence the way of picking out the right people to trust and to bond with, basically learning from the past in a way.

It is a defensive mechanism developed by your mind and body after all, even if its not good for you once it starts to influence your daily life and decision-making capabilities.

I kinda wanted to see if anyone could add to this or maybe even relate? I may absolutely be overanalyzing this/it may just be a silly coincidence but I'd love to maybe talk about it :)

Thanks a lot for reading!! "
548,Experienced a new kind of panic attack - help,"Last night I felt a panic attack come on. My heart started to race. I felt the impending doom and like I couldn‚Äôt breathe or swallow. I then started to feel like things weren‚Äôt real around me, and so I sat up. I was on the couch with my bf. I sat up and looked around trying to figure out what was going on. I turned to him but I couldn‚Äôt talk. I felt like everything was slowed down, unable to get words out properly and I kept staring at the time. I gestured with hand movements that my heart was racing and tried to get out a few words. I asked for help and he tried to figure out what to do. I‚Äôm prescribed Xanax for panic attacks, so he went to get one for me. My body moved so slow. I laid down on the ground and he eventually laid with me for comfort. I cried because I said I couldn‚Äôt understand why I couldn‚Äôt talk properly. I legit felt like a small child trying to get words out. It was as if I had something hindering me from opening my mouth properly and speaking. When I‚Äôd try to speak I‚Äôd be stumbling over words. When I tried to walk, I was barely able to move my legs and I walked so slow. It felt like my brain just stopped working. That lasted a few hours until the Xanax properly kicked in and I eventually felt better and could speak a bit more normal. I went to sleep and today I‚Äôm ok. Though I‚Äôve had panic attacks before, what happened last night has never happened before. Has this ever happened to anyone else? 

I want to note that this happened prior to taking the Xanax. The things I experienced are not a side effect of taking it. I‚Äôve taken it many times for panic attacks. I‚Äôve never had a panic attack where I am unable to talk or walk properly. Being physically unable to talk is what is especially upsetting and confusing. "
549,can anxiety and stress cause hallucinations?,"for at least 10 years, I have occasionally had hallucinations when I am very anxious or stressed. they are usually audio hallucinations. sometimes they are just sounds but sometimes they are voices. they aren‚Äôt telling me to do things or speaking to me though, it‚Äôs just other people talking. I‚Äôve also had hallucinations where I thought someone tapped me on the back or shoulder but when I turn around there is no one there. it‚Äôs only happened like 5-10 times over the past 10 years though.

it makes me even more stressed to think about possibly having some psychosis disorder idk. I‚Äôm also scared because I read that if you‚Äôre able to tickle yourself you might have schizophrenia and I can tickle myself! I don‚Äôt believe I have any other symptoms though.

edit: also, I definitely have the thing where I feel/hear my phone buzzing even when it‚Äôs not. this is such a common hallucination though?? I‚Äôm pretty sure that most people who experience this don‚Äôt have schizophrenia "
550,I need to reset my life. A full refresh and life glow up. How can I do this?,"Over the past year, life in general has changed and has felt different, weird and confusing to me, I seem to constantly be wishing for the pre-covid feeling of life. Where people seemed to be happier, pop culture seemed to be thriving, and overall life was more of an experience rather then the drag it seems to be now.  
  
I have lost my motivation to continue working hard and after many mini ""resets"" to try to get myself on course, it hasn't worked. I seem to be constantly wasting my days saying that, ""oh tomorrow it will be better"", but it usually isn't and I can't live my life because of this. It's been going on for so long, I am close to giving up.  
  
I need to make an immediate change, as I have exams soon and I need to regain focus.

I just cant seem to be able to sit with the fact that although it could possibly happen it is pretty much impossible in terms of likelihood. In my mind 0.001% chance == 100% chance it happened.

553,How safe is klonopin (clonazepam) for long term (3months) ?,"

I have been prescribed xanax 1mg per day for anxiety and panic attacks. I ran through 15 pills in 45 days as I was taking those super consciously. My doc changed it to klonopin as I didn‚Äôt have good results with xanax, my anxiety was still high even on xanax. Instead of going for a higher dose, he went with a med change. 

I‚Äôm now scared to take klonopin on daily basis for 2-3 months. I am taking those as last resort during high anxiety phase or panic attacks. 

How long does it usually take to get dependent/ addicted to klonopin? I have read up benzo horrors and I‚Äôm scared to continue my meds now.

556,My anxiety is getting so much worse and my parents can't even notice it,"I am 15. I've been playing the piano since I was 9. I've had amazing teachers. But after 3 amazing teachers, now I have to endure the new one. 

I won't lie, she is an amazing teacher, but she just wants too much from me. Last semester we had to play in front of a room full of parents and it was like a mini concert. Well, I played awful. My anxiety got so bad that I was about to throw up and it was so bad that the mark I had since birth turned from light pink-red to dark purpleish blue. I was shaking like crazy and I could barely walk.

In the end, I made a BIG mistake and I stopped playing and had to start again and even the second time I made a big mistake in the same place. 

It was bad and I can't understand why the teacher, after seeing me play so bad in front of others, still forces me to prepare for a competition that I will have in March. I told her I don't want to but she still makes me. 

Today we had a kind of test for the teachers to see how ready we are to play for the competition. My anxiety took over me and I messed up 3 times so I had to start the piece 3 times and I messed up again in the middle of the piece and I had to start from a bar I was confident I could start. It was awful. At least the second piece was better and I made just a small mistake. 

But I just can't understand why the teacher would make me go to competitions when I can barely play in front of a single person, let alone a whole room of professionals. 

After the test, she still said I would be going to the competition and I am just so stressed. I have so much to do. I have a TON of school work, and when I say a ton, I mean it. I also have 2 Olympiads to prepare for that are due in March/April and these are the freaking national Olympiads for History and Physics for my age (I'm dead). 

And I have 3 exams at the end of the year that I have to take a straight 10 so I could finish my school and go to another school (hopefully one focused on medicine).

Anyway, my parents don't see how stressed I am. They think the teacher is the problem. So after I literally cried on my way back home, my dad told me that he will come with me and get me out of the music school. 

Like man, out of all the little things that I tell them to hint that I might have anxiety, they choose to do that? Obviously I am not gonna let him take me out of the school because I am too much of a people pleaser and I am scared that my teacher is gonna hate me, but still? 

I should've taken some calming pills... Ugh, I hate it when I vent so sorry if someone had to read all this shit."
557,Anxiety causing depression,"Hello everybody,

I (22M) feel like all this anxiety is causing me to be depressed, I don‚Äôt want to push it as it wasn‚Äôt clinically diagnosed, but I‚Äôm getting to a point where I can‚Äôt even really enjoy a good time anymore.

This endless spiral is just so frustrating, I don‚Äôt have a day or a night where I just feel ok, where my chest doesn‚Äôt feel like it is being crushed, where I just feel overall ok.

I have always been against taking medication as my brother is on them and has lost touch with himself, and I truly believe I can end up scrapping something up.

But I don‚Äôt know if I can keep doing this everyday.

I‚Äôm a musician, but right now I don‚Äôt even make anything all that interesting because it feels like I can‚Äôt feel those feelings the same way anymore, and that‚Äôs the worst part of it for me.

I‚Äôm close to losing my job also and can‚Äôt focus on my studies, but as I said, I‚Äôm literally numb to it.

And my friends try to help and I love it, but the fact no one can truly understand just makes me feel even more alone.

Just needed to vent, but if anyone has any advice for me, I‚Äôm not against it."
558,Anxiety at my first job,"I've been at my first job out of college now for over a year and a half. I take great joy in it. I like my co-workers. My manager's great. It's intellectually stimulating and rewarding work. I feel like I'm actually making a meaningful contribution to society. It's great.

On the other hand: it's been awful at times. I am scared of making mistakes that will have big consequences. I also have to deal with a lot of very pushy people. They want me to rush things, or they want things that are not possible.

I am by my nature quite an anxious and conflict-avoidant person. As a result, there are moments in my job that I hate. A few weeks ago I was sleeping so poorly because of it I even considered quitting.

I am gonna stick around though. And there's a few reasons. For starters, *any* job I have will give me anxiety at times. No doubt about it. So that's not enough reason for me to quit. Secondly, I think I can learn to be better. I will have to learn to be more firm and to engage in conflict more often. The best way to learn that is through spaced repetition.

Today I put my foot down. It was received quite well. I am actually quite proud of it. I wasn't forced to bring it up, but I overcame a reluctance on my part. I think I can learn to get better at this. That, in time, will make these anxieties less intens. "
559,Advice?,"For context, I‚Äôm 17f and I don‚Äôt even think my doctor has ever diagnosed me with anxiety. A few weeks ago I was at the dentist and like the curious person I am, I was looking at the dentist‚Äôs computer that has all the patient info, and I saw that on my file it said that I had ‚Äúsevere anxiety‚Äù. 

Ive lived with these symptoms for as long as I can remember: fast heart rate, I turn extremely red, spams? Not sure if that‚Äôs the right word for it, I start shaking a bit, gets difficult to breathe, I start sweating, and I sometimes get nauseous. This always happens when I‚Äôm presenting a project, working in a group, meeting new people, or even just ordering food. Whenever I walk through the hallways I feel like everyone is staring at me and I‚Äôm constantly worried that I‚Äôll make a fool of myself. It‚Äôs as if my brain is constantly working against me and telling me that something bad will happen. I guess I just thought it was normal and didn‚Äôt even think about it being anxiety. I consulted my doctor about it and she said that I don‚Äôt need medicine and that I should just take deep breaths. I honestly think I‚Äôm way past that point, I‚Äôve done almost everything people have suggested and I still feel like this. It‚Äôs gotten to a point where I‚Äôm starting to feel depressed because of all the opportunities I‚Äôm missing out on just because of my brain coming up with so many negative outcomes. Should I just go to the pharmacy and get smth? I‚Äôve seen people recommending medication for it but I‚Äôm kinda scared to try it, idk why.

561,Contrast allergy ,"I'm not sure if this is allowed so I apologize ahead of time. I am 37 year old female with known contrast allergy. I had a reaction years ago where my whole body shook. I was red. Very out of it. I don't really remember it all just that a lot of nurses came in and gave me meds. I have had contrast after this and was premeditated and did ok besides usually a couple days later my face and legs are hot and red. 
3 days ago I had a scan with contrast and instantly had chest pain. Tried to stand up and walk and went down. They told me I was having a panick attack but then ended up profusely sweating. Couldn't breathe. Hot. Verge of passing out and chest pain. Again I don't remember much once I got bacm to the room besides they hooked me up to ekg and lifted the legs and gave me meds ans my bp was very low 65/40. They gave me pepcid. My bp did come back up and was released to go home. 
Since then I'm having flushing on and off constantly. It feels like my skin is burning but I don't have hives. I am waking up drenched all through the night. Sweating on and off and red face.chest. sometimes back. Just different parts of the body very hot like heat intolerance.  Especially when laying down and something is touching my skin. 
Sorry for the long post. But could this possibly still be me having a reaction? 
Thank you. "
562,Does caffeine really cause anxiety?,"I read here that quitting caffeine and alcohol helped people calm their anxiety a little.

I overthink things and won't stop until I get more and more paranoid to the point I was constantly stressed and anxious about every little conversation I had ruminating about all the awful things people i love may do behind my back. 

After a few rough weeks of no caffeine I felt calm, still mildly anxious about things but nowhere near to the extreme, I felt like the extra energy wasn't there for my brain to do extra worrying. 

I tried one coffee yesterday, and by the end of the day I was a mess, back to being paranoid again, I woke up worrying about everything. Is this really the caffeine? Or just in my head? People who have also quit caffeine, was it permanent? Can you explain further your experience? "

564,Those who suffer from sudden racing heart - help me out please!,"Hi guys,

Recently had a racing heart (60s to 170s before coming back down to the 100s-120s) come on me while I was relaxing out of nowhere. It sent me straight to the Emergency Room where I underwent an ECG, x ray and blood tests - all coming back fine. 

I got sent for a 24 hour monitor and an echocardiogram - the echocardiogram came back fine and I was told sinus rhythm with brief episodes of sinus arrhythmia for the 24 hour monitor but nothing my cardiologist was concerned about.

I have kept getting these since - some have sent me to the Emergency Room again. Now, I'm being treated for anxiety as that's what my doctor thinks it is. I am trying to get this into my head so I can start dealing with it but I haven't been able to get all my questions answered yet regarding heart health and I'm going down the route of podcasts to begin coping with anxiety. I cannot find anything that matches what I get in regards to a sudden feeling of being fine, then a couple of jolt sensations before my heart rate goes shooting up.

Last night, I got woke up by three strong jolts in my chest. My heart rate just before waking up was 58. A minute later when I ran an ECG on my watch, it was coming back in the 120s before rising to 145 and dancing around in the 100s. I then started with the other symptoms I've started to get - tingling/numbness in hands/feet, feelings of surging pressure in my head/body and trembling/shakes. My heart rate remained in the 100s for around twenty minutes before it started to come back down gradually 90s-100s, 80s to 100s, 70s to 90s and then the shaking/trembling stopped very suddenly and things just went back to normal. This is getting a pretty regular occurrence now (though a lot of them tend to happen when I'm usually awake and not wake me up)

I'm just trying to find out if anyone else diagnosed with anxiety suffers with this same thing as in trying to educate myself on my symptoms, I keep pulling up more and more information that is suggesting SVT rather than anxiety which is making me more anxious! 

Many thanks for any stories you can provide of your own."
565,Sudden anxiety attack ,I feel my jaws clenched (tight) for no reason i mean i know what the reason is but i been feeling better since i am on my medication i also feel like I am not breathing fully what I wanna know is why do I feel all of this all of a sudden 
566,"Anxiety, prozac/pregabalin","Hello there everyone! First time posting on a subreddit like this, I‚Äôve dealt with agoraphobia since I was 18 and now 29, from ages 18-23 I was stuck in doors and from 23-29 everything has been okay as I feel like it‚Äôs coming back.
I spoke to a psychiatrist and he recommended that I should take Prozac as it‚Äôs been the most helpful ssri for me, and wants me to go to 50 mg.
Currently just started taking 30 mg last night and increasing the dose every 2 weeks or so, he also prescribed 25 mg of pregabalin x2 a day a month ago but I‚Äôve been scared to take it, I‚Äôve always used Prozac and Xanax as needed if I had panic/anxiety attacks. Does anyone know or have used this combination before? Part of the reason I‚Äôm scared is because when I was cross dosing from Paxil back to prozac, a pharmacist gave me something called 5-htp I believe that gave me really bad heart palpitations, loss of appetite for weeks and had emts come by and take ecg tests of my heart. Had 3 of them done but they‚Äôve said nothing was life threatening, ever since then I‚Äôve been scared to mix much of anything as I‚Äôm still recovering a bit.

568,What the hell is this ?," ( Sorry if my english is not correct)
So I have been suffering from generalized anxiety disorder and social anxiety for years.. At first, it was accompanied by disturbing symptoms such as a strong desire to move the limbs and muscles: I do not know how to explain this, but it is a desire to move the hands and legs and fingers and bite the teeth as well.. 
Well  So far everything is fine
 But recently this desire has developed... and it has become in my eyes... where I have a strong, irresistible desire to move my eyeballs and not move them normally... but rather to put pressure on them and tighten my eyelids to the point that my eyeballs reach their limits. This is really scary and causes pain, but I cannot stop it. I only get relief when I do this
 I'm afraid this will cause me to lose my eyes
 Any similar experiences???"

On Sunday I didn‚Äôt feel that different,however Monday I got super anxious halfway through the day and had to take another Klonopin. I did take all my meds yesterday. 

Today, Tuesday, overall my anxiety is high but not as bad as last night. Is it possible that forgetting my medicine could have a delayed response like that?

571,What can help?,"I'm 37F I can't go to the doctor bc we don't have the money and no health insurance. I have dealt with horriable and crippling anxiety for almost 8 years now. I always would manage it with alcohol.( trust me I know it's not the answer and makes things worse) I can't even call myself an alcoholic bc I don't really like alcohol. But it's the only thing that can help me ""deal"" with situations I know I will have a panic attack in. I really don't even drink much but if I have to do something I know will trigger a panic attack I get a few beers. I know my limit and keep it that way. I don't like feeling out of control of my mind or body. But the idea of needing to use alcohol to cope with these situations bothers me alot. I have only wanted to feel normal or able to deal with these situations on my own for so long. When I speak of situations that give me panic attacks, they are dumb. Makes me feel dumb. Things like going to the DMV or somewhere I have to sign my name all sends me right into panic.Usually day to day BS. I hate it so much. I have done all things that I can to try to stop this anxiety, supplements and breathwork and meditation, yoga, eating right...etc. ..as I mentioned before doctor isn't an option rn. I actually work all the time at keeping myself as the least anxious as possible but as much as I do I get so discouraged bc the anxiety is still there. I don't know if I'm just crazy or I crossed some wires in my mind at some point and became a habit to react this way. I feel like a burden bc I have small limits. But in my mind I don't want any of those limits, I want to do so many things. If anyone has had some success with anything let me know, advice or something. All I want to do is be a good mom to my kids and a good wife. I'm tired of anxiety stopping me. And I'm tired of saying I just need a few beers then I'm good. Thanks in advance. "
572,Supplement sensitivity,"Anybody experience extreme sensitivity to supplements? I used to stack many different supplements with no issue. After having a few bouts with Covid, and a bad concussion with lingering symptoms it's like I can't take any without some sort of reaction. I do have health anxiety, but my noted symptoms below are opposite of panic attacks.

I had a bad panic attack a month ago, and quit taking supplements to give my body some time to recover. I took 600mg of NAC a week ago (haven't used it in over a year), and my BP and HR got extremely low. I was shivering and shaking from how cold I was. My normal RHR is around 48, it got down to 40.

I haven't had caffeine since 2020, but decided to drink a green tea a few weeks ago - same exact response from my body. Which is surprising that my HR didn't increase. RHR was at 38 during this day."

But these last two months have been a little hard. The anxiety keeps flaring up, the numbness in my body (arms amd hands), the fear of my own heart and death. Im afraid to exercise but still manage to push trough because I really enjoy it (muay thai). I feel like all my progress is going down the drain and it makes me angry and sad at the same time. I really dont know what to do or how to deal with it. 

Im currently on medication and regularly visit my psycologist and psichiatrist. All the more reason for not understanding why am I feeling like this again.

Sorry to vent. Hope anyone that reads this os good and keeps getting better. (English is not my first language so sorry for any errors)"
575,Just some reassurance that I‚Äôm not alone‚Ä¶ ,"I feel like my mental health is the worst mental health ever. Anyone I talk to about it never has experienced anything quite as bad and it worries me how badly I‚Äôm affected because I desperately want to recover. Since I was 21 I‚Äôve had huge panic attacks which can last days and take me like two weeks to get over. I have to get extreme support and love and presence from my parents and sister to get through it. It seems to happen every few months sometimes there‚Äôs a trigger sometimes there isn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm currently in a bad blip and the anxiety is just intolerable the big shoots of anxiety through my chest and tummy feel so so frightening and scary. For some reason this time I‚Äôm extremely down too I am 30 now btw. I‚Äôve had to go off sick at work again I only just went off sick in January. I‚Äôm absolutely at the end of my tether it‚Äôs like there‚Äôs a huge wall in front of me and I can‚Äôt get past it. Like there‚Äôs no hope. I believe I‚Äôm autistic but not diagnosed. Always been called weird odd strange etc. I still live at home, I‚Äôm overly attatched to my mom and dad, I can‚Äôt seem to hold down a job, I have no partner because I don‚Äôt seem to get attractions. Life just seems‚Ä¶ impossible‚Ä¶ i am starting to see a pychologist soon and my gp regularly sees me and knows.  I‚Äôm really hoping they can help. I‚Äôm on Prozac. Just feel like I have no life and am completely stuffed. :/   I can‚Äôt even go on holidays since 21 as I get panic attacks when I go away and it seems unfamiliar. What kind of life is this. Any tips? Hope? "
576,Picking skin/lips - how do I stop?,"I‚Äôve been anxious lately because I‚Äôm considering having major surgery in a few months. 

Whenever I get anxious, I pick at the skin on my lips and my face. My lips are so sore and I‚Äôm sick of having red spots on my face. It‚Äôs kind of a texture thing as well - if the areas have any peeling skin or a tough/scab like texture, I feel a strong compulsion to pick off the scab or peeling skin because it drives me nuts!

Can anything be done to help heal the spots on my face as fast as possible? I‚Äôve tried neosporin and I try to keep the spots moisturized so they don‚Äôt develop a rough texture so hopefully I don‚Äôt pick them as much but it doesn‚Äôt really help. "
577,I am going through it ,"I've been feeling very fatigued and slightly dizzy even for about 2 weeks now. I can't tell if it's anxiety or if it's something else. I have an appointment tomorrow to get some blood work done that will hopefully answer some questions. I've been giving myself panick attacks thinking about it being something heart related. I've been taking my blood pressure regularly and it's been decent. Sometimes my BP monitor says I have an irregular heartbeat. I know I don't because I've had multiple EKGs, Echos, a few Holter monitors, and even a cardiac MRI. But it still gives me a ton of anxiety nonetheless. Any advice? "
578,How to get out ,"I‚Äôve been in a rut for a while. Last year something happened (I don‚Äôt know what) but I started to feel dissociation, then it turned into me not recognizing myself in the mirror, then physical symptoms started, pain in my legs, nerve failure, arrhythmia, pain behind the eyes, jaw pain, and many many others. Then in January this year I had my first panic attack ever, I‚Äôve been trying to get over it but the physical symptoms are continuing. I‚Äôve been to many many doctors and Emergency room visits and no one can find anything, which I‚Äôm glad for, but, I‚Äôm still very sad about the whole thing. I never thought I would end up like this. I‚Äôm 35. Anywho, I decided after yesterday and another ER visit I‚Äôm starting to take Prozac, 10mg to begin. Has anyone been through anything like me that has been able to get their shit together with medication? What else have you taken? I‚Äôve used adaptogens before, like rodhiola, Cbd, I‚Äôm in therapy but it only helps so much. 

I‚Äôm ready to overcome this. Any suggestions on what I can do? Ice baths? Exercise? Help. "

582,I feel like such a burden at work,"I am so sick of talking about my mental health. I don‚Äôt want to be messaging my manager AGAIN because everything feels too overwhelming and I need time off, or because I can‚Äôt do a basic task that everyone else is doing no problem but is triggering panic attacks for me, or because I need to go to therapy again and they only have sessions in my working hours and then I have to ask for time flexibility so I can come back to work after my session and pretend I haven‚Äôt just been bawling for the last hour. I feel so pathetic. 

I‚Äôm so angry at my brain. I hate that I don‚Äôt function like other people function and I hate that everything is ten times more difficult than it needs to be. I hate feeling like everyone is judging me at work but needing to swallow my pride and ask for the accommodations anyway despite the fact that alone makes me feel anxious. I honestly just want to disappear sometimes. The only thing that keeps me here is my daughter and how safe I feel when she comes home at the end of the day and we‚Äôre cuddling, but even then I feel like a failure of a mum for struggling this much to just do the things people have to do to live. I‚Äôm meant to have my shit together. I really hope I don‚Äôt pass this on to her. "
583,Struggling after SSRI,"I have been off generic brand Lexapro (escitalopram) after taking it for 3 years, for a few weeks now. I thought I was doing alright, but recently all of my physical symptoms and panic attacks suddenly came back. 

My only reason for stopping Lexapro was the weight gain which was inducing more anxiety (Not looking for weight loss advice, I‚Äôve already lost a little just being off of it).

I wanted to see how I could cope without meds at first, but to be honest I‚Äôm struggling. Has anyone else come off meds and been able to stay off? Or if you‚Äôve been on one that has not had a weight gain side effect?

But my dad told me they would stop supporting me from next year so I decided to get a stable job. But I have a crippling anxiety because I can't do interview or social interaction   and so my stress got high and I started having panic attacks so i finally decided to go to psychiatrist and they diagnosed me with anxiety disorder and depression and my treatment begin after my treatment started i started getting better. Before that I couldn't talk to people on cellphone or irl , i used to stay home all day but after treatment  I was getting better. I started doing thing's, id hang out with friends or go on outings. And I finally decided to give a regular job a chance  i have a master's in computer science  so getting job is not hard as long as my anxiety in check.. so today was my first interview and cleared all rounds except last one where I had to talk to them on conference. There were three people and I made a small mistake because of that i got  anxious and i started shaking and I got sweaty and then I went blank and i couldn't speak and couldn't answer simple questions. And i failed the interview

I've been in depression for last six year and last 8-9 months were the best month I ever had but now I feeling sad again. Like I don't have any purpose and I am useless and it feels like all treatment was a waste.. I don't know what to do now..

587,Overthinking,"Kind of long post‚Ä¶ My head is going in a spiral! It‚Äôs better some moments and then the next I feel myself getting heat flashes where I get so anxious. About 3-4 months ago I went through a difficult mental health moment where my mind was taking me into a dark place. I was stressing about hypothetical scenarios and even told my friends that I feared someone seeing my Reddit post and talking smack about them (I had posted a pic that could‚Äôve been recognizable) . I know I was deep in the rabbit hole and while i am better, it still comes at times. Before this I would stress and overthinking at times but never to the extreme that I‚Äôve recently experienced. I would snap out of it within a couple hours/ days. Someone ‚Äújudged me‚Äù but more like made a comment about something I spent a lot of money on and for some reason that triggered everything. 2 years ago me wouldn‚Äôt have gave a single crap about other peoples opinions about me but that one comment like I said triggered everything. I don‚Äôt know what to do. Now I find myself overthinking conversations I‚Äôve had or being extra cautious on what I say or do bc I don‚Äôt want people to see me as negative/dumb/ugly. I‚Äôve also had really low self esteem for quite a while but this overthinking was from one minute to the next. I still wake up sometimes with a knot in my stomach waiting for something bad to happen. I find it that it gets better about halfway through the day. It sucks. And like today, which is the reason why I decided to post this was bc I‚Äôm thinking how I‚Äôm better now which is a positive but then I started overthinking how I really told my friends all my thoughts and that I should‚Äôve never done that bc they can ‚Äúexpose me‚Äù. It really hit me in the morning but now it has gone away but I still wanted to ask for advice/opinions/ similar or any experiences anyone has gone through?"

I am petrified that I have MS. I have had tingling, all over my body, itchiness, anxiety feelings in my throat, light sensitivity, perceived forearm weakness (but not actual weakness). I also do have health worries due to some health issues my son has. I‚Äôve been on sertraline for 4 weeks 5 days (25 mg for 1 week the rest has been 50 mg).

I‚Äôm signed up for an adult education class - Introduction to Baking - that meets for three hours on Tuesday evenings. I‚Äôve only attended two out of four classes so far. Both classes I missed because I was stressed out about other areas of my life and just didn‚Äôt have it in me. Class meets again tonight and I DO NOT WANT TO GO. 

I‚Äôm stressed, depressed, anxious, and exhausted. I want to go home after work and rot a little. But I feel like if I keep letting the rot goblin within me win then I‚Äôm never going to make real change and I‚Äôm going to be miserable forever. Or maybe I have to accept I didn‚Äôt win the fight today. There‚Äôs always next week, and then the following class that begins mid-March which meets twice a week (I‚Äôm already anxious thinking about how I‚Äôll muster the energy for that as well).

I don‚Äôt know what I want from this post. Partially just to say it ‚Äúout loud‚Äù or maybe I want permission to go home, hang out with my cats, and play Animal Crossing instead of going to class.

I‚Äôm also nervous that my partner will be mad at me if I don‚Äôt go. And I got chummy with another classmate during a class and I‚Äôm like, hey! a potential friend! But if I never go to class then I‚Äôd be squashing it and feel like I‚Äôm ultimately self-sabotaging.

I haven't had any really bad side effects, however, I have thrown up maybe three times in the last 3/4 weeks. Twice it was after having a glass or two of wine, but the third time I can't really understand why it might be. I've got an appointment with my doc on Friday to check in that this is normal, but did anyone experience similar?

597,Took drugs and it caused lasting anxiety even when sober.,"Need some advice on drug induced anxiety

So about three weeks ago I took 20 mg of adderall in instant release form. Which is seemingly nothing compared to doses I‚Äôve done before. I‚Äôve taken up to 40 within the same day before, granted not all at once and not all instant release. 

Anyway the point is that it caused me to have this anxiety attack over seemingly nothing. The anxiety I felt is oddly similar to that I have felt while tripping on psychedelics. The most unfortunate part is that this feeling never fully left me.

Even three weeks later I still have anxiety from it everyday. It‚Äôs constantly on my mind. I wish that I hadn‚Äôt done this. Sometimes life feels pointless to me now. 

I‚Äôve quit taking all forms of stimulants since including coffee and dark sodas for the most part. Some days I feel better than others. Yesterday was kinda rough compared to the last few days.

Also it‚Äôs probably important to add I‚Äôve been smoking weed (probably around a gram a day no breaks) for about 4 or 5 years and I‚Äôm currently 18. I also vape nicotine daily for about as long. Occasionally drink but not enough that it should cause any problems (maybe once or twice every other week).

Another factor that may contribute may be the fact that I don‚Äôt get out much anymore.
Ever since I dropped out of school (a story for another day) I‚Äôve been in my room all day pretty much. And there‚Äôs literally no windows in my room, no way to get any natural light, except the rest of my house which is usually occupied by my parents and their friends so I don‚Äôt much want to be out there all day.

Please feel free to ask any questions or redirect me to a more appropriate subreddit or any resource necessary. Thanks for taking the time to read.

Im open to hear any and all advice please."

in a week i'm going to visit some family on another continent, it's been more than 10 years since i've seen them and they often ask me to come and see them. i thought for a long time about an excuse not to go but i told myself that i had to show my brain that there was nothing to be afraid of, so i took the plane ticket. It's a big family and I think we'll be visiting 3/4 houses, which makes me really anxious because I know they'll ask me lots of questions, and on top of that I'm not very fluent in the local language.

602,Crippling anxiety about being caught in a mass shooting.,"25M, stuck in the US.

I never thought I‚Äôd come to this point, but I want my childhood and middle-school years back. At least back then, I felt safe being out and about. When the Aurora Theater and Sandy Hook school shootings occurred in 2012, and now I‚Äôm suddenly told it isn‚Äôt safe to venture outside of my home anymore, and politicians would rather see me die than support any gun reforms, my perception of the environment around me being a safe place was broken. I had to go to high school after that knowing each day I walked through those doors could be my last. With each major mass shooting that occurred throughout the 2010s, and gun laws being loosened rather than tightened, my anxiety intensified. I‚Äôve been avoiding public areas and crowds long before the pandemic just for that reason alone. I only leave home when absolutely necessary, like for work or school. And I don‚Äôt talk and try to avoid eye contact with others, because you never know who might be carrying a gun. I hate that I have to live like this, but I don‚Äôt want to become part of such a gruesome statistic. It‚Äôs unfortunately the price I have to pay for living in a country where guns are more valuable than human life. With proper gun control out of reach for the forseeable future thanks to a conservative-majority Supreme Court, it looks like this is how I‚Äôm going to have to live for the rest of my life. No mass gatherings, no social life at all, no peace of mind. It‚Äôs really depressing to think about. "

And when we were going back, I felt my mind just kind of lift off. I felt like I wasn‚Äôt look through my eyes and like I couldn‚Äôt feel my body even though I was walking and I was able to see. Then something happened on Reddit where I was getting downvoted for my ‚Äúobliviousness and insensitivity‚Äù (I have zero idea what the f they were talking about because all I did was wish someone happy cake day üò≠) Anyway.

605,My exams are just round the corner and I can't concentrate,"

I feel very restless and I'm unable to focus when I sit to study.

I am a dental student and the syllabus is very vast. And I'm really scared because it's not very rare to fail in these exams. These are my finals.

I just feel like I don't wanna sit alone. I try video calling my friends to keep them on call (on mute) and study together just so that I am able to sit and focus and study. But I feel like I'm bothering them by calling again and again.

I used to text my bf whenever I used to have exam stress and he used to calm me down. We broke up so I lost that support too.

My family won't understand the kind of stress I'm going through and they'll just blame it on me that I should have studied earlier to avoid this situation.

I feel like my head is so heavy and I've lost appetite. I feel like crying. Anything I do to distract myself makes me feel guilty for not studying.

I've tried to keep my phone away from me because if I start scrolling, I waste a lot of time.

I don't know how to cope with this situation. I've been sitting in my chair for 7-8 hours now and I'm trying to study.

Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks."
606,How do non-anxious people deal with uncertainty? ,"So I read that a major factor leading to anxiety is that we can't deal with uncertainty. As far as I understand it anxiety tries to prepare us for any case that could possibly happen. It's a great amount of thinking, what could happen, how other people could react, what consequences there could be, etc. So people, who are not anxious - do they just not think before doing sth? Do they not think about everything that could happen? How do they deal with the things that unexpectedly happen? "

608,Anyone else have this?,"I don‚Äôt know what to do. I am a 21 year old female who has struggled with anxiety my whole life. As I have gotten older, I have used ways to hide my anxiety by being overly confident. But last weekend I realised how anxiety is actually taking over my life and I want to get help. 

For example one of my issues is that I am vain and take lots of selfies when I dress up/make up because I am confident in the way I look, I‚Äôll post these to instagram and get lots of validation. However, my self esteem is extremely low and never actually feel good enough, pretty enough. I  pick and point at my face, pretty much obsessed with any asymmetry or flaw on my face and it‚Äôll stop me from going on dates or being the centre of attention in a group, because I am so insecure of my face and going red (blushing anxiety). I don‚Äôt know why I give off so much confidence to the people around me but actually have so little love for myself. I want to find out how to get out of this negative cycle, because it is ruining my life. 

I was meant to go on a date this weekend with a guy who I find attractive. I prepared for 3 weeks, going to the gym, nails done, everything, just so I knew there was nothing ‚Äúwrong‚Äù with me. I couldn‚Äôt sleep for 3 weeks because I was so nervous. He ended up cancelling on the day and I cried my eyes out, unsure whether it was relief he cancelled or something else.

Not sure if any of this made sense, but any advice or help would be appreciated. A little bit of extra info, I also have ADHD (medicated) - if there‚Äôs anything to help with adhd/anxiety"
609,Suffering from Anxiety,"Long post ahead, so beware.

Until September of 2020, I had NEVER dealt with serious anxiety and NEVER depression. But at that point, our neighbor accused our dog of biting her son and tried to sue us. Turns out her claim was false and nothing ever came of it. However, I developed severe anxiety during that time and was put on 10mg of Lexapro once per day. It's been downhill since then.

The Lexapro didn't really help with the anxiety, but it did help with my anger issues. I got off of it last summer and boy did I notice how snappy I became. My dr put me back on the same dosage.

Fast-forward to summer of 2022. We moved from the South to the extreme NE, which we love, but it's different to live somewhere than to vacation there. My job is great, my kids are happy, but something was just off. So I turned to Delta-8 and later Delta-9 to try to curb my growing unhappiness. I'm afraid that's caused even more of an issue, so I'm now weaning myself off of the gummies and am now down to 10mg only at night and will go to five next week and then none after that.

I have also been reading about how much anxiety and gut health are linked. I've always had a really bad stomach, and could have diarrhea three to four times daily for weeks on end. I also suffer from diverticulitis periodically. I had a flare up in Spain a year ago and bought some probiotics over the counter there. Apparently they're really good and we can't get them with the same ingredients in the US. I took them for the week I was there and felt better overall, but I just thought it was because I was sick and worried in a foreign country. So, I've started probiotics again.

Fast-forward again to about a month ago. Still dealing with more anxiety and depression than ever before, but doing somewhat better since Xmas. I had to have surgery on Feb 5th to have a disc decompression and was home for three weeks. I don't know what triggered it, but this past weekend I had anxiety like I've never had before. So I started researching.

Turns out Delta-9 can cause serious anxiety and depression, and I had no idea. I thought it was supposed to mellow you out! That's why I'm tapering off.

For those of you who have had similar issues, what did you do to fix them? I'd REALLY like to go back off of Lexapro, but am afraid of being angry/snappy again. Anyone deal with similar? Also, what pro/prebiotics/other supplements have you used for those of you who also found out about the link between mental health and gut health? I've heard L-theanine and magnesium are good.

I'm done with living like this and I'm determined to fix it no matter how hard it is. I'm only 45 and I have a family and this is no way to live. So I would appreciate ANY information that you guys have.

Also, I'm on other medications for various things that I'll list here. I've heard that some of them can cause issues as well.

Lexapro 10mg 1x daily (depression/anxiety)

Gabpentin 100mg 3x daily (facial nerve numbness from cervical disc replacement)

Allopurinol 100mg 3x daily (gout)

Tizanidine (I forget the mg) 2x daily (bad spine)

Amlodipine 5mg 1x daily (hypertension)

Lisinopril 30mg 1x daily (hypertension)

Baclofen 10mg 2x daily (bad spine)

Buspirone (I forget the mg) 2x daily (anxiety)

Vistaril (I forget the mg) as needed (anxiety....I rarely take this. It doesn't do much for me.)

Edit: I also plan to get off of at least the Gabapentin and Tizanidine within the next couple of months as I've read that these can be linked to depression and anxiety as well.

610,Tickles Throughout the Inside of my Body and Brain,"I have been pretty anxious the past few weeks because my panic disorder has come back. I thought I was getting better, but now it seems randomly parts of my body and brain will start to tickle. I‚Äôve been getting brain zaps as well when I focus to hard. Can anyone relate to this? And what can I do? It seems like it happens even when I‚Äôm not anxious. I can‚Äôt go to the doctors until next week so I‚Äôm nervous something is going on. "
611,Skin crawling (formication) and hives...,"Just wondering if anyone else has experienced either of these...

Feeling of hairs, tickling/crawling on my face and hives popping up on my chest and stomach.

Went to the doctor she put it down to stress and anxiety so i was curious to see if anyone else can relate?

I had this just under a year ago during a breakup with my ex wife, all tests i had that time where clear. 

Anyone???? Please..."
612,terrified of women...,"..which coincidentally is pretty funny considering I'm a 6'3 black guy so they're all far more scared of me lol.  
  
No matter what I do I cannot get to the point of dating, and I'm at my wits end. I'm 31 and for years I've been trying to improve myself. I still am. From running 3x a week, volunteering, creating grooming routines, dressing really well, I make decent money, being more social, etc and nothing seems to be working. I'm still invisible to women. And while I don't work on myself to meet women, people always say ""don't focus on meeting women, work on yourself, and they will come"" yet, in my case, they literally never do.  
  
I don't chase women or dates. I'm not desperate or anything. I have anxiety and low self-esteem so I don't approach women at all. But so often people will assume I'm trying to force women to like me and being creepy or staring at them or hovering around them or something and that's not the case. I barely interact with them at all. I'm the last person to try and force anything as I assume no one wants me around anyway, lol.  
  
I'm ugly anxious so it doesn't help matters. I've tried five different OLD for years but I simply doesn't look good enough to get anything .I don't have delusional standards either, I would easily take a woman just as unattractive as I am. I'm 6'3 so that's something that should help me physically, but height is pretty moot when you're tall lol. And I'm not shallow. I care more about a woman's style, sense of humor, taste, interests, disposition, etc than just her looks. But it seems women never extend that same curiosity.  
  
I've tried volunteering at an arts gallery and a clayworks studio, too, and that hasn't led to much, even platonically. Women always seemed closed off and uninterested, even just platomically. I've joined several meet up groups, but I'm too anxious to actually attend them. I'm just trying to get to the point where I can casually date and get more experience and comfortable around women. I'm not seeking the ""perfect women"" to come along and fix me or anything. I'm just trying to find someone with some compatibility to do things with...People say ""don't try to find women, and they'll fine you""...Well aside from being invisible on dating apps, I haven't tried to find women in years, and I still never meet them.  
  
No matter what I do, I'm never able to approach them. No at bars, concerts, festivals, art shows, volunteering. Not even for a platonic conversation let alone anything more.  
  
At this point I'm just convinced my face, anxiety and low self-esteem are too big of a hurdle. If I could just give up and stop desiring women, I would...but I still desire companionship, affection, intimacy, romance, support, etc and no amount of isolation makes me forget this."
613,Health anxiety,"Can anyone please talk to me about health anxiety? I just need to talk to someone. I‚Äôve spiraled so bad and stuck. I can‚Äôt get out. I‚Äôm trying to make an appointment with a therapist and already have one with my PC doctor. But just sitting and waiting in the meantime. Back story: My first round of health anxiety came in about 2016. Going through a very rough period in my life. I started having really bad vision problems. I was literally seeing everything double. I completely convinced myself I had a brain tumor. After many doctor appointments and proper scanning the neurologist told me I was perfectly fine and it was anxiety and stress. Literally as I left the doctor office from hearing that the double vision went away. My PC prescribed lexapro and I took that for a while. Caused me to gain a lot of weight and after a few years I got off it thinking I had things under control. In 2021 I sat on the couch one night and realized my legs were numb from the knee to my ankles on both legs. Naturally I freaked. Convinced I had some terrible life ending disease. Went on Buspirone which I‚Äôm still taking. Started seeing a therapist and taking b12 shots bc my b12 levels were a little low. (I did see my PC and was referred to a neurologist) This was the worse spiraling of my life. I started having muscle twitches all over my legs that were like fireworks and constant which I took as another sure sign I was dying. It took literally a year for the numbness to go completely away. The twitching got better after about 6 weeks. Now here we are about a week and a half ago I got a slightly scratchy throat nothing serious and what felt like a lymph node swelling on the right side of my throat. I started feeling like something was stuck in my throat. I kept trying to remain calm telling myself I was just getting some little virus. I never really started feeling sick. Just the swollen lymph node and something stuck in my throat feeling. I took a Covid test Thursday and it was negative. I went to the walk in clinic yesterday and I tested negative for strep. He said all the ‚Äúimportant‚Äù lymph nodes they check in your neck were perfectly fine on me. He said I did have some fluid in my right ear which is the side I‚Äôm feeling the (what im assuming is) lymph node swelling. He prescribed steroids and antibiotics and said to make an appointment with my PC. I have that appointment made for Thursday. But in the meantime I‚Äôve convinced myself I either have throat cancer or lymphoma. I‚Äôm spiraling so bad again. I had quit going to therapy bc of the financial cost. But I emailed her last night and asked to make another appointment. I just need someone to talk to. I keep telling myself it‚Äôs just my anxiety but these symptoms are real just like every other time. They are real. The question is whether anxiety or something else is causing them. I keep telling myself it‚Äôs anxiety but my brain says welllllll even people with anxiety get bad sicknesses. I‚Äôve spiraled so bad I can‚Äôt think straight, I can‚Äôt perform normal daily activities. All I want to do is google stuff trying to find something that will make me feel better and just lay in bed. I completely shut down. I can‚Äôt talk to people I can‚Äôt do anything. Please help me in the meantime while I‚Äôm waiting to see all the professionals. Also please be nice. I know y‚Äôall can‚Äôt really do anything for me. But I didn‚Äôt know where else to go to talk to people who might understand. "

617,Anyone Quit Ambien?,"Hi, I am a 63 year old guy, healthy, who mistakenly became dependent on Ambien.  Was having a tough career year and just stopped sleeping.  I had to drive a lot and was afraid of falling asleep at the wheel.  

Could not get a psychiatrist (in short supply here) so went to a bad doc who prescribed Ambien with no exit plan. Then went back to my PCP who said they were okay to keep taking. They're not. Now 6 years in and they are only giving 2 hours of bad sleep nightly.

I now have a psychiatrist and his advice is to just stop, but you will go through four days of hell then you will start to restore sleep.

My PCP (who is very benzo friendly) is reluctant to get me off them but seems to recommend a tapering schedule from 10mg to 5mg, then to zero.

Also, when you search ""quit Ambien"".  No good medical advice but tons of rehab centers come up all with differing points of view and very high price tags.  I could afford it but think I'd rather be home in my routines with all my stuff.


I'm inclined to just quit.  The 5 mg probably will do nothing at this point.  Give the pills to my wife and tell her no matter how much I beg, don't give them to me.

So wanting to hear supportive words from others who've taken this journey.

Thanks!"

622,DAE read too much into everything? ,"i‚Äôm not sure if this is my anxiety or just something else. but i hope someone can relate.

so i have the ability to read people SUPER well, like one glance and i immediately know what they‚Äôre feeling (ie: upset, happy, irritated) unfortunately this comes with problems, for one, other people‚Äôs mood affect mine, so if someone‚Äôs upset, i will then be upset just because they‚Äôre upset. 

but also, which i think is the biggest problem. is i read TOO MUCH into everything. like if i sense someone is irritated, my mind immediately goes to, ‚Äúthey‚Äôre irritated because of me‚Äù ‚Äúoh they‚Äôre irritated by me being here‚Äù ‚Äúi‚Äôm annoying‚Äù ‚Äúomg they hate me‚Äù if someone‚Äôs upset‚Ä¶ ‚Äúi did something wrong, i said something wrong they‚Äôre upset because of me‚Äù even when someone makes the SLIGHTEST facial expression, for a quick second, depending on the expression, my brain immediately jumps to reasons why they‚Äôre irritated, mad, upset, is because of me. even if the expression wasn‚Äôt at me. i do this with everything and everyone, even if, say i just walked in the door at work, and i noticed one of my coworkers is irritated or not in a good mood, even though i JUST WALKED IN and didn‚Äôt even interact with them yet, my brain jumps to reasons why it‚Äôs my fault or ‚Äúthey‚Äôre irritated that im here, they hate working with me‚Äù it‚Äôs like im always out to get myself, i NEVER win with me. like i am ALWAYS over analyzing everything, and finding ways to make it my fault. 

and the thing is, i don‚Äôt purposely do this, and i tell myself so much that, if someone seems in a bad mood, irritated, upset, it could literally be anything, something could be going on in their life, or they‚Äôre simply in a bad mood or not having a good day. but for some reason that doesn‚Äôt stop myself from making it seem like it‚Äôs because of me or my fault somehow. i can literally be in class, and hear someone sigh loudly, and i automatically go to ‚Äúthey‚Äôre sighing because of me, am i breathing loud? do i smell bad? am i moving too much? do they hate me?‚Äù like literally anything i can come up with. i hate this so much, because no matter how much i try to acknowledge that it‚Äôs most likely not me, i can‚Äôt help it, i cannot stop myself from thinking im annoying everyone somehow, or that everyone hates me.

im just always out to get myself, and i hate it.

627,Is this a symptom of anxiety?,"29M here ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve had DPDR off and on since I was 16 yr old. I consider myself having had all of the symptoms over the course of the years. 

But recently , there‚Äôs this sensation where my body is sensitive to motion so to speak. Sometimes it feels like my body or soul will suddenly drop or rise or ‚Äúbounce‚Äù for a few seconds. Bad episodes last a few minutes or so. It feels a bit out of body, but not constant , but more like my ‚Äúessence‚Äù takes a jolt in any direction. I know some will say vertigo, but it doesn‚Äôt really feel like that to be honest. It‚Äôs similar but my intuition says it‚Äôs different. Often when I stand as well or walk a little bit, it can feel like the floor will suddenly move a little bit beneath me or I missed a step or something. It basically feels like my perception or signals that control motion are out of whack. 
Lastly, if I move my body back and forth or my neck back and forth , for example if I am rocking my newborn baby to sleep in bed sitting up, it can feel like as if I‚Äôm very sensitive to motion and trigger that rocking sensation just with my movements. Maybe overly sensitive to my body?

638,Anxiety and Office Jobs,"What do you guys struggle with when working in an office environment?

I've never told an employer that I'm autistic because I don't want to be seen differently but I always struggle with the same things. I also have generalised anxiety disorder and social anxiety disorder that I've had since I was a teenager (34 now) and  are probably caused by the autism and I'm also prone to depressive episodes.

I always end up being isolated and known as the quiet/shy one in the office. Initially when I first start a job for the first few weeks/months I mask and put on a much more sociable act. But this becomes exhausting quite quickly and I start looking for ways I can avoid everyone without even realising it. I think people see me as the weird one who hides away upstairs and me thinking this makes me feel even more awkward.

When I do socialise I sort of act like a robot most of the time, most of my personality is an act and I'm just dying to run away the entire time. I also don't really find idle chit chat in office environments interesting at all and get extremely bored. I have different interests that people don't often share.

I have physical symptoms of anxiety like a lump in the throat and trembling anyway so I generally avoid opening my mouth in social situations so I don't get judged for how weird I know I look, which just makes me look even weirder probably.

I end up seeing everyone around me negatively because I think they're judging me and I don't want to go into work anymore and I become more depressed and it all just goes in a big negative cycle.

 I tend to switch jobs every 1-2 years because of these reasons so I'm thinking of making it open in my current company so that I'm understood a bit better but I really don't know now if I suit the office environment at all and if I'd be better off doing another type of work.

I don't want to work a fully remote job because I feel like if I put myself in less social situations I will just become worse and never leave the house.

I'm thinking of getting into a manual type job because I tend to be less anxious when I'm keeping myself physically busy and I have less time to overthink EVERYTHING. I really shouldn't spend so much time inside my own head."
639,"Is this DVT (deep vein thrombosis), or am I just panicking?","I'm asking this question on here before going to an ER/calling 911 in the case that I'm in over my head.   
About 30 minutes ago, I was lying on the couch scrolling through TikTok. My mind was already hyperfixated on a weird feeling in my chest (I do get anxious about having a heart attack), so I got on TikTok to ease my mind and focus my thoughts elsewhere. I was laying on my side, legs on top of each other, bent at an angle, when all of a sudden I feel this weird, cramp-like feeling behind my left knee (like at the part where it bends, right in there). I IMMEDIATELY shot up in panic. I have a massive worry about developing DVT and having a pulmonary embolism. I stretched out my leg a bit and tried massaging it, and that cramp feeling went on for another few seconds. I started to wonder if a blood clot had went from my calf to behind my knee. I got up and walked to the bathroom (to see if it hurt when I walked/stood on it, which it didn't), and then sat down in the bathroom. I went to Google (yes, I know, probably a cardinal sin) and looked up DVT. I read through the symptoms. So far, I have no pain in either leg. I do not have any swelling. No discoloration from what I can tell. No areas of warmth. But while I was sitting down in the bathroom, I felt a weird sensation in my left thigh (same leg as the cramp feeling) on the outside portion, and I once again thought, ""Omg. This is DVT. I need to talk to someone right now. I'm going to die."" 

  
It has now been 35-40 minutes since this happened. I am now lying on my bedroom floor. I just finished checking my legs for everything once more. I tried some positions to see if I could squeeze my left calf for pain (apparently that's one way to see if you have DVT?), and nothing happened. I do have a tingling in my left leg now that is worrying me.   
What do y'all think? Is this DVT? "

643,Physical symptoms of anxiety,"Hello üëãüèª 

I have had anxiety all of my life. But it used to be just in my head anxiety (I hope that makes sense!). The most I would get for physical symptoms were heart palpitations.

This past November, I suffered a massive panic attack that was accompanied with vertigo. I've never experienced this before in my life. It was so terrifying and I didn't understand what was happening (it woke me up from a nap, so I was very scared and confused). It landed me a hospital visit. This would happen 2 more times. 

Since then I've tried a few things, SSRI, SNRI, natural supplements because the others just made everything worse. I finally settled on benzos (clonazepam). It's the only thing that can bring me back down to earth. I don't take them everyday, just when I can't handle it anymore (like once a week before bed). 

After this all happened my physical symptoms went from heart palpitations to constant dizziness, nausea, depersonalization/derealization episodes, jitters, tingling, stiff and fucking sore neck and shoulders, headaches, feeling unbalanced, panic attacks, and my heart skips a beat if there is even the slightest of sounds. 

I haven't been able to leave my house much at all because of these new symptoms.

I guess my question is, does anyone else experience these symptoms with their anxiety?? This part of anxiety is all new to me üò© it's unbearable at times. I wish I could sleep it off but I can't sleep and when I do I still wake up to them.
I'm doing all of the breathing exercises, meditations, etc. Nothing seems to work.

I've had every test under the sun done to rule out anything else that may be causing these symptoms; ECG, MRI, blood, urine, blood pressure. My doctor says I'm going to live a healthy life but it certainly doesn't feel like it!

644,Terrified of brain tumors ,"TW for cancer talk in general 



I‚Äôm 19, healthy, and I really have no reason to be so afraid of them. I guess the fear comes from the fact that brain cancer is one of the deadliest forms of cancer you can get, and there‚Äôs always that ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù in the back of my mind that I‚Äôll end up getting some incurable brain tumor and experience a super painful and slow death in which I lose function until I‚Äôm nothing but a shell of a person. 

I feel so guilty for feeling this way because I know tons of people ACTUALLY have these conditions and would give up anything to be healthy like me and have anxiety be the only medical condition they suffer from. 

I have a history of leukemia in my family and those who have had it have survived and gone into remission. (Not even brain cancer. Again, not sure where the fear came from lol) It‚Äôs just the fact that cancer, in general, happens to so many people. Someone I knew from high school, super popular and sweet girl, was diagnosed with cancer this past year as well. It feels like everyone is getting it. So how can I be sure I won‚Äôt be a victim someday too? 

I know the algorithm is feeding me videos because of what I watch, but the more tik toks I see about young people getting these incurable cancers and brain tumors, the more I feel like it‚Äôs inevitable for all of us. Even if that‚Äôs not true. 

I‚Äôve heard ‚Äújust live life to the fullest‚Äù and ‚Äúdon‚Äôt fear the things you can‚Äôt control‚Äù THOUSANDS of times but that doesn‚Äôt comfort me. It just makes me more afraid knowing that I‚Äôm out of control of my life and fate. How do I handle this?? How do so many cancer patients handle their condition with such grace? "
645,Can anxiety cause ‚ÄûMemory Loss‚Äú?,"Hey guys. I struggle with anxiety at times and since November/December another ‚Äûepisode‚Äú came up - after I decided to reduce my dose of Paroxetine from 20 to 15 mg. In January my dr. told me to go back to 20mg again. I think I have the worst of it behind me already, but yeah. Lately I have a kind of diffuse worry about going crazy, losing myself, losing touch with reality and so on. I also feel a little distant and my eyes are exhausted too. I also tend to forget small details. Like rn, I wasn‚Äòt sure if I was already on the 2nd Bus or still on the 1st. I could remember after a few seconds, but not immediately. 
Thanks for answers guys! "
646,Life is so hard sometimes for no reason,"Sometimes existing is just so hard.  I (29F) had a really bad depressive episode a few months ago that really shook me up. Lately, I've been trying to just stay in the present but having a hard time as I have nothing ""next."" 

I went to school, got a job, and fully support myself and live on my own, but I am ""missing"" a relationship though, so I still feel like I'm failing at life in some way and missing out on something. 

It is super tiring feeling like i always need to keep working towards the next thing and that I'm failing for not being in love. 

Also been overthinking even what happens after marriage, like what then? Esp since I don't want kids. Idk just struggling to find reason and just feel content living. 

Anyone feel the same or similar?

649,stress taking over my life,"lately i've been so stressed out that everything i do is haunted by a looming dread- even when i'm doing something fun, i'm still getting stressed out in the back of my head about why i'm not as happy as i should be. i'm only now starting to realize how debilitating it is, and how much i let my anxiety control me.

650,Sexual Anxiety (Straight Male),"Context on my particular situation. Im 22, have had a good couple hands full worth of sexual partners in my day. But only 3 of them have been with someone that I really had deep feelings for. And only those 3, I've had massive sexual performance anxiety. And recently, I've met this girl I'm crazy about, and it's happening again. We've talked about sex a lot, and what we both like and whatnot, but everytime things start to head that direction, I back out. I don't necessarily know I'm so scared of, but it drives me nuts. I'm embarrassed about it, and normally, I can just fight through it, but this time is proving to be more difficult and prolonged. I would feel a million times better if I could just communicate how I feel about it to her, but I feel like I have the same anxiety about having that conversation, as I do about actually having sex.

Then right before my second last meeting, BAM, an anxiety attack was brewing. It wasn‚Äôt even like I was anxious about the meeting. I‚Äôm good at what I do. In fact, work is the 1 thing I DONT get anxious about. It was so frustrating that I had to disclose to my boss that I was on the edge of a panic attack. However I powered through and finished the meeting, slowly calming myself down as the meeting went on. My boss was lovely about it, told me to go home and take the week if I need it.

Ever since, I feel SO hungover. And panicky. And GROSS. it sucks cause I was just getting all this under control. :( has this happened to anyone else? "

654,am i normal? it‚Äôs def more than anxiety,"last month i‚Äôm scared that my panic disorder it‚Äôs part of another dangerous mental condition. i analysed all my life and see that before first episode panic attack (2.5 years ago) i always wrote diary‚Äôs, and every day my notes look like ‚Äúohhh nooo i‚Äôm unhappy today i‚Äôm so stressed about something‚Äù and ‚Äúooh today i‚Äôm so happy because i read new book how to be happy bla bla bla‚Äù and i see it‚Äôs like i was crazy all my life. btw i had in past before my disorder self-harm( 10-15 times) and sometimes had suicidal thoughts. now i‚Äôm scared that i can do suicide(like obsessive thoughts). now i see all that and i‚Äôm sure that i can develop some psychosis in future, or i have bpd maybe, or something because i have changes in my mood all life. but only after my first panic attack i see that i‚Äôm totally not okay, before that i just leave and learn how to leave , read about how to be happy different books etc. sorry for my english, what you think, am i okay and it‚Äôs just my anxiety or i really need help?

655,Child with anxiety ,My 9 year old is suffering and has suffered with anxiety for a solid 3 years. Maybe even more. Right now his biggest fear is throwing up. We have tried EVERYTHING. He‚Äôs on fluoxetine. We‚Äôve tried cbd. Talk therapy. Hypnotherapy. Foot zoning. Physical activity. Literally everything. He‚Äôs to the point where he can‚Äôt go to school or enjoy functions anymore. I feel so lost. So hopeless. I had him at the pediatrician today for blood labs and everything is normal. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm looking for advice. Or a miracle. I just feel so lost. 
656,Heart palpitations,"So I‚Äôve been getting heart palpitations for the past 10 days, but also my heart has been skipping a beat a lot too. I suffer with palpitations in general but it‚Äôs never been this bad before! Even beta blockers (propranolol) that I usually take as and when needed, hasn‚Äôt calmed them down. I did call 111 and they sent me to urgent care for a ECG but the wait was 8 hours +, after 5 hours of sitting there nearing 3am I was too tired and decided to come home. I also suffer with anxiety so I‚Äôm thinking maybe it‚Äôs due to anxiety? But I‚Äôve never had the heart skipping a beat so bad before and the palpitations never last this long so I‚Äôm scared üò© maybe I‚Äôm just overthinking it and it is anxiety presenting itself differently? I‚Äôve had a 48 hour ecg monitor in the last month and it didn‚Äôt show anything majorly wrong with my heart, it came back with my T waves saying abnormal and my heart at times was tachycardic (beating faster than it should) but they never took any immediate action so I‚Äôd imagine that‚Äôs a good thing, I have an echocardiogram scheduled for may time because the cardiologist wanted me to still go ahead with it as I was complaining of palpitations. The cardiologist said everything was fine too. I don‚Äôt know why the palps have suddenly become so bad, has anybody ever experienced this?? "
657,Panic attack coming - what helps,What helps you prevent it/stop it? Full of anxiety and ruminating thoughts. Weird feelings. Health anxiety. Help üò≠
658,Mom had a bad panic attack tonight and I had to help,"It's not exactly fun when you have an anxiety disorder, and you're prone to occasional panic attacks from time to time, when your mother decides to have **the** **nastiest** panic attack herself on the verge of **fainting**, and you have to be the one to stabilize her until she's driven to the hospital. 

Even worse, I wasn't completely certain it was a panic attack and she was exhibiting really alarming behavior/symptoms, like sluggish in her movement and not being all there, and she was praying very openly cause she thought something horrible was happening to her. I was so close to calling an ambulance, probably one of the scariest moments of my life. 

Like I said, I have experience with panic attacks so I did my best to breathe deeply with her, to ground her as much as I could so she wouldn't faint, and get her downstairs so she could be driven to the clinic. And I was shaking the whole time, my heart was racing, at least the breathing I was helping her with also helped me. 

  Overall..... it's interesting how I suffer from the same thing myself. But then in a moment of emergency, even if I'm a huge ball of panic and hysteria on the inside, my first priority is still my loved one and I have enough willpower to try and help them. 

...........At the very least she's okay, and it was confirmed to be a panic attack. But I was not a fan of the experience.  "
659,friend being mad at me ,"One of my best friends, let‚Äôs call her sushi, is extremely mad at me. she has not answered my texts, or my calls, for the last 7-10 ish days. this is very unusual given we were very close and would talk almost on a daily basis. People, mutual friends, have told me that she is mad at me! I have no idea why. I am racking my brain and sitting here in crippling anxiety, unable to move or think properly, because I can‚Äôt figure out why she‚Äôs mad at me, and she won‚Äôt talk to me. How do i get out of the stage of constant anxiety when there‚Äôs truly nothing I can do for myself in this situation? "
660,Looking for meds that won‚Äôt make me fat and depressed,"I‚Äôve avoided relying on medication for a few years now but I‚Äôm close to giving up. I‚Äôve tried working out consistently, meditating, cutting down caffeine, journaling, and nothing works. I feel like I should give medications another try as a last ditch effort because my anxiety‚Äôs gotten to a point that I have constant chest pain and constantly feel like I‚Äôm going to die. 

So far I‚Äôve been able to rule out these meds for either making me fat, depressed, suicidal, or just not working:
- Lexapro
- Venlafaxine 
- Trintellix (too expensive)
- Prozac
- Zoloft

I know it takes trial and error to find the right medication but I‚Äôd like to hear what works for other people and I might try it out"
661,Ground Technique Help,"I know that a helpful tool when feeling anxious is to identify a number (for me it's 2) of things for each of your senses. However when I disassociate and need that technique now more then ever, I feel like what i am feelings isnt real. Does anyone have any advice for a hyper aware person with anxiety?"
662,Big win today ,"So I‚Äôll start by saying I‚Äôve been unemployed for the last 3.5 years because of my extreme anxiety. Id have random panic attacks constantly and feel like I was going to have a heart attack whenever I tried to take a walk. I was on constant edge every day for about 3 years. So to not make this too long I‚Äôll fast forward to now, I‚Äôve been on an Ssri for the last two months and I‚Äôve been doing some exposure therapy. Today I was able to leave my house and go out and I only thought about my anxiety ONCE. This was a big step for me today and I really feel in a few more weeks I should be able to get a job again because being unemployed really affected me negatively, I‚Äôm so grateful for my parents but sometimes I feel like a leech (I‚Äôm 23 and should be helping myself). So I‚Äôm writing this because I‚Äôm proud of myself but also I want others to know that everything can get better with time even when you feel hopeless because I‚Äôve been there."
663,Is medication worth it for a not severe anxiety? ,"Just as the title says. I recently got a presctiption for Effexor (75 mg) but after reading about the withdrawals, I'm very hesitant to try it. The thing is that generally, when I avoid study/work related triggers, I feel quite good. I was sent to a psychiatrist by a psychologist when I was in the middle of a crisis at a time, so I just couldn't stop crying or do anything properly really, hence the prescription. Now the situation has been resolved, so I do feel better, but not all the way, and I am easily triggered by a number of things - which I am not sure if I can avoid them. But at least I seem to function, and dont feel that bad anymore - while staying at home at least. 

I have an appointment in two months. I kinda would like to try the meds and see if I function better, but also I am not sure if, for the luck of a better description, if I feel bad enough for it. 

Due to some personal circumstances, I most likely wont be able to go to a therapy within the next 7 months or so. I already know that it'll be a super stressful time, so I might get into a very bad state again, and I can't really afford it (and dont want to). However, I generally am able to function ok more or less due to extensive support of my partner. It just takes too much time and energy out of me, and I cant predict what will trigger the anxiety at this point. 

Have you had such experience? Could the meds make things worse? Im just so confused. One minute I feel fine, and then something happens - and I'm too stressed out to do anything more than staying home and washing dishes. How bad did you feel before starting the meds? 

TLDR: not sure if I should start the meds, since I have resolved a situation and feel better, but only when there are no triggers, otherwise I can't function well. I am also worried I will easily go back to a superanxious state. Would like to hear about your experiences. "
664,Attack tonight,"It happened again.  Had a great day, no worries.  Suddenly tonight I felt my sinus drain and I chocked on my mucus a bit.  Boom. That feeling rushed in my chest and gut. I tried to fight it but then the thoughts crept in. You can't breathe, something is wrong.  Boom it hits again and again and again.  My o2 ranged from 95 yo 99. Took 20mg of busiprone to try and help. Nothing. 

In already on that and effexor. Still get hit. Close to two months ago I was hit with night time attack that jerked me awake everytime I was about to fall asleep sending me to the er. Didn't sleep for 33 hours and got put on 2mg of melatonin. It helped but I fought through constant attacks for about 2 weeks. Both attacks and breathing issues combined with sudden need to be truthful about everything. Worried about all things medical thinking what if my hearts failing, my lungs failing, maybe I have asthma, cf maybe.  The hypochondriac hits me. I even call suicide helpline to see if they help with attacks, which they do talk to you surprisingly. Not suicidal au all myself as I'm afraid of death. 

I feel useless. Took my pills and melatonin and just had a jerk before I feel off to sleep. I'd the melatonin failing now. Will I go to the er again. When I breathe in I feel the most smallest of bubble. Now I'm worried I have pleurisy or something when I'm sure it's just post nasal. I feel alone. Like none else has these feelings"
665,Feel terrible after driving specifically to work ,About a month ago I had a random panic attack driving home from work and it messed me up for weeks but it was also found I had ear infection and fluid buildup as well that also made driving bad because I had vertigo. Well I've been on buspar for about two weeks now because the doctor checked me up and down and I'm healthy as can be and everytime I drive to work and back I feel horrible. I can drive anywhere else except work. Was just wondering if anyone else has battled this before and wouldn't mind some tips on how to handle it. To be specific I feel very just out of it when driving which in turn spurs the anxiety on more. I'm lucky enough to have a girlfriend who doesn't have a job right now that can take me back and forth but we can't keep doing this forever. 
666,Really unhealthy thoughts,"To clarify, I am autistic, so I experience much more anxiety than most other people I come across in my day-to-day life. 

Pretty much everyday I experience downright toxic thoughts about a plethora of things. One that reoccurs often is the thought that I'm going to be arrested for something, despite the fact that I know deep down I haven't done anything illegal. Even when making other unrelated posts on Reddit, I'll get this anxiety without actually having committed anything. For some reason it's like my mind produces this sort of ""fog"" about what I have done and what I haven't as to try to cloud my memory. I also get really weird body thoughts that tend to overtake my mind. I started having reflux a couple of months ago and definitely hasn't helped. If anyone else has experienced anything like this, I would love to know."

669,(19F) Debilitating Medical Anxiety,"As the title suggests, I, (19F) have debilitating medical anxiety. 

During my freshman  year of high school my mom was diagnosed with stage three breast cancer. Doctors kept dismissing her initially to the point that one took her seriously‚Äîit was at stage three. 

Around the initial diagnosis, I developed panic attacks and chest pains where I‚Äôd lay down on the ground crying and saying to myself curled my up in a ball ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to die. I don‚Äôt want to die. I don‚Äôt want to die.‚Äù in my head over & over again. 

During that time, I could feel my veins pulsating in my arms & it would send me into a spiral. I was more hyper aware of all my bodily functions than most of my peers; which, was to my detriment.


Fast forward several years & graduation, I am here now in a similar spiral. In the past two weeks, I‚Äôve been having cold fingers, fatigue, unexplained weight gain, etc. Point being, it sent me back to a point I was at several years prior. Several years that I had worked so hard for me to not experience similar things.


They are going to take another follow up test next month regarding what I‚Äôm experiencing, but for now, I am left with my thoughts & anxiety. The what if‚Äôs. I feel bad for my family. I feel broken. My mom is alive and so is the rest of my family & yet I‚Äôm the only one who‚Äôs still not fixed. 

I had a panic attack tonight fearing I might‚Äôve became allergic to peanuts (as silly as that sounds), and felt my throat get tingly and my tonsils begin to feel huge. I was told I‚Äôd be ok, so I‚Äôm going to sleep it off soon. I took diphydramine after the tiny teaspoon of peanut butter I ate after feeling a bit tingly.  I should be ok. I believe it‚Äôs just my anxiety. 

I still get my chest pains from time to time."

672,Work Anxiety after work and weekends,"Hello, I want to ask you about the situation in which I am suffering from a lot of anxiety even after work. I came home after work and even the days i still have Energy to do things, I feel so anxious that I end up not even knowing WHAT I want to do. I have many hobbies I enjoy doing but due to the anxiety that piles up after working for 8-9 Hours, I no longer feel any motivation to do anything. This even happens to me on the weekends, I arrive to my saturday not knowing how to spend my weekend. I feel like work disssociates me from my own persona, and I end up using my free time to recover from it and come back to who I am. But for the time I recover and come back, its already monday and time to work again. It has been going on for ever since I started working and its making me so miserable, drained and exhausted.

674,Is it normal to need higher dose after many years?,"Is it normal to need a higher dose of meds after many years?

Over the last ~2 ish years I have noticed things that weren‚Äôt bothering me have slowly crept back in. My OCD is significantly worse. My anxiety is a lot more frequent and severe. Almost back to how I was before I was on meds. I have no problem upping or even changing meds if that‚Äôs what‚Äôs prescribed, however as a full time graduate student who is about to start clinical rotations.

The panic attacks were so bad I couldn‚Äôt even leave the house. It felt like a safe space and once I left, I felt like I was gonna pass out even though I didnt then 3 months later I went to the doctor and got put on sertraline(zoloft) and it didn‚Äôt feel like it was working and then it finally started to but then now I feel like my dizziness kind of came back but I don‚Äôt have panic attacks anymore and I get flare ups but I don‚Äôt have panic attacks anymore but sometimes it feels like I‚Äôm almost gonna have one my symptoms are very Physical I get a weird dizzy lightheaded feeling (cant even really describe it but closest to what it feels like) also, this doesn‚Äôt happen as much but once in a while, it feels like I‚Äôm walking on a boat or an elevator going up and down and then when I‚Äôm laying on my bed, it feels like I‚Äôm being pulled down and heavier also derealization and feel like my eyes arent working right when they are and last is my muscles will feel achier or tense more like im fatigued or something and some say ‚Äúyou have to just kind of accept it And it won‚Äôt be as bad because you know you‚Äôre really OK and that it‚Äôs just caused by anxiety‚Äù but then I think like I‚Äôm not in control and I get anxious because I‚Äôm wondering why it won‚Äôt it just go away completely ? but also sometimes I feel this physical stuff even when im not even anxious at all but then thinking about why im feeling this way even without anxiousness will cause anxiousness but maybe im unsubconsciously anxious idk so I think it all won‚Äôt go away because I keep thinking about It instead of excepting so its a cycle but how do I except it if in my mind Im thinking there‚Äôs gotta be something wrong with me physically since im still feeling this way ? ik reddit isnt the best place for this stuff but Ik there is other people who might have struggled similarly so please give your input I need to know if anyone has felt the same"
676,I always wake up in a state of anxiety and guilt.. even if I went to sleep feeling fine ,"This happens on a daily basis, I always wake up like this. It's like my base emotion is anxiety.

Does this happen to anyone else? 

What can I do?"
677,Constant interruption of focus? ,"Recently had a new issue of insomnia hit me like a truck at the beginning of the year. It got so bad the doc prescribed me meds (hydroxyzine) to help me sleep. I'm working on getting my sleep back but in the meantime noticed some focus issues and wasn't sure if it may be also anxiety related. 

Getting this annoying thing now where I will be thinking of something in my head and my brain will just stop. Like full visual in my head right about to advance the plot and it shifts me back to whatever my eyes are looking at. Boom, complete lack of train of thought happens. 

This has been happening a lot lately (at least every conversation I have with gf). Weird thing is I can focus fine when say typing a reddit post or reading a story, it's just when I am thinking and moving (like overload or something). It's annoying af and I just want to complete a train of thought.

679,Feeling sick 1-2 weeks after an attack,"I‚Äôm looking for advice or suggestions on how to deal with feeling physically ill after a panic/anxiety attack. Attacks for me manifest physically by feeling itchy and agitated, along with increased heart rate and breathing. Although they are not fun, the main issue I face is that they leave me feeling sick (and unable to work) for at least 2-3 weeks. My ‚Äòsick‚Äô symptoms include difficulty concentrating, no appetite, no physical strength, etc.

I‚Äôm in therapy now and have been on ssri‚Äôs for about 8 weeks, but I get the impression from my doctor that most people don‚Äôt have this ‚Äòsick long after an attack‚Äô issue. I‚Äôm just looking for advice on whether the ssri‚Äôs should help with this, or whether I should/could be doing something else. Thanks."
680,How to help my husband,"My husband just came home from work which he left early because he had a panic attack. He is an ER Nurse and normally fine under pressure. I know he has been suffering from depression and is seeing a therapist, but it doesn‚Äôt seem to be helping much. He is also on 300mg wellbutrin prescribed by his pcp. I asked him if he wanted to go to a crisis center in the morning but he said that is for people who are suicidal. But I think having a panic attack so bad that you have to leave work seems like a crisis? I don‚Äôt know what to do or how to help him. Any advice or suggestions appreciated."

682,Anxiety and ADA question....,"Hello all - apologies for the throwaway account....

I have a tendency to ramble so I'm trying to be brief.... My job has been pretty anxiety-inducing, but it's been manageable until recently.... I was talking with my therapist today and mentioned I might try to apply for an accommodation under ADA.  She was really supportive, but here's the thing, which is kind of tripping me up (and causing **more** anxiety, of course)...

The accommodations I need aren't even really ""accommodations""....? Like, I shouldn't even have to be asking for this?

I keep writing the situation then getting mired in the details, so here's the summary of the situation (if you want more details I'm happy to provide lol).  I have job A.  It's very public.  Another coworker has job B.  It's very much behind the scenes.  Job A relies **entirely** on job B being done.  If job B isn't done, I, essentially, fail in a very public manner.

I have tried communicating directly with coworker, in what I thought were neutral and constructive tones.  Coworker has been downright hostile about this - at one point they held their hand up to my face and walked away.  Like. Okay????  

I have documented this - the errors, the hand in the face.  I have sent my supervisor the documentation.  I have sent coworker's supervisor the documentation.  I have customer complaints supporting my side.  It's not a one-time thing it is continuous, I am fucking up my job because they are setting me up to fuck up.

My supervisor has been silent.  After months of this coworker's supervisor finally stopped by unannounced and basically said everything was my fault, and maybe if I was just better at my job I wouldn't be complaining about coworker all the time.

I cannot stress how much my job function relies on coworker's, this comment was as nonsensical as something like: ""if you were really so good at baking apple pies you'd be able to make them without the apples.""

So I'm at my wit's end, and every time I go to work just fills me with more anxiety and dread (I can feel the beginning of a panic attack just typing this), and finally I thought of pursuing an ADA accommodation....

But the accommodation request would just be ""make coworker do his job""

That seems bizarre, but that's really all I need, and the supervisors aren't helping.... would I be nuts for making such a request, do you think?!

Is there some other way I could frame it that doesn't directly address coworker?  Like, ""all materials necessary for job function must be available for inspection at location of job site no later than one hour before job begins""?  Like, I need to be able to see the apples on the table before my pie-making shift begins?"

684,I rarely feel like myself,"Hi so I am gonna be really honest and maybe this me just overthinking my life. I go to Amherst College, I am a guy and 20 years old and a freshman. I have had moments where I have cried because of how happy I am and how much I love my life. The main question for me has been how do I talk to people. I sometimes am with people and dont know what the fuck to say and its like how can this be on me. I think its gonna drive me crazy. I have had so many good conversations and try really hard to keep talking and say something meaningful enough. Maybe my problem is I dont know how to express the stuff I really want to say or maybe I just have nothing to say. But here is the caveat, when I am drunk I have so much to say and so much to ask. But I cant be drunk all the time and only really drink when the weekend hits. I just want to know what can change any of this for me --- shrooms???? Maybe I am just getting way into my head --- I do a lot of overthinking. Does anyone have any thoughts???"

688,feeling like my world is ending,hey im m16 and have ben struggling with frequent panic attacks and anxiety for the past two weeks that have made me feel so drained. These panic attacks landed me back into the hospital and therapy which I felt better after but during the week I had to watch a movie in class that scared me and made those anxious thoughts come back. Just lately even seeing things about what‚Äôs happening in Gaza is making me terrified that my world is ending and watching that movie made me feel this way. My mind is convinced myself that Im losing control and i‚Äôm never going to have a future and that causes more anxiety and panic attacks. Im scared to fall asleep in case something bad is going to happen even though nothing does. I‚Äôve just been so exhausted the past 2 weeks and now thinking about this stuff does not help. I feel so drained and genuinely cannot do this anymore. I feel so alone even though I have friends and family who love me. Im so scared lately that leaving my house makes me feel ill and i just want to be in my safe space.

when i speak in my mothertongue it feels like im always trying to say a tongue twister and my mouth feels weird. this leads me to stumbling on words and getting really nervous, therefore talking less, and being scared to meet new people.

695,Anxiety Hangover,"First of all, I'm a male 29 years old and was  diagnosed with anxiety and depression at 16 (even thought it definitely started when I was 4 or 5 years old)

Hi, last tuesday night I had a mini attack that was dealt with pretty quickly and I thought that would be end. The next night I experienced a terrifying anxiety attack in the night that was the largest I've had and hopefully will stay that way. I didn't at any point believe I was panicking but that my life was coming to an end. A reckless life of drink, drugs and alcohol will do that, I'm some what able to look after myself but I've never cared much for my physical health, or mental health for that matter. I digress; after that I had a smaller one the day later and since then I've just had a constant feeling of unease and paranoia. 

Mentally I feel a lot stronger, no longer constantly running through every minute detail in my head. Physically on the other hand I cannot stop shaking, my bodies in pain it's like each limb is doing rounds of pain. Not too hard to deal with but frightening enough to set my anxiety off again. It's a vicious circle of panic. I do believe I'm in the so called ""Anxiety Hangover"" period of my complete meltdown although the ironic worry I hold is keeping the circle well and truly alive.

It's been 5 days almost 6 of this. I have seeked medical assistance and now taking a cake load of pills just to not completely crumble. (Venlafaxine, Propranolol and the odd Diaz). Have been to the hospital for an ECG which returned no concerns, which should be a huge relief. 
Short story long, it's just the physical side of things that sucks now. The constant shaking the ever surprising palpations. 

I'm proud of myself. I'm doing everything I can but it doesn't seem enough. If there's anyone that could shed some light or give any advice on this situation please let me know. I'm scared I'm going to los emy job that I just started. I just want to go back to work."
696,Valium for Anxiety induced Insomnia,"Hi all! I‚Äôve just been to the doctors and have been prescribed Zoloft/Sertraline 50mg & Valium/Diazepam 2mg for severe anxiety, depression & insomnia. Now, I‚Äôve just dug myself into a little rabbit hole of people who have become addicted/reliant on Valium after using it too frequently to help them sleep. My doctor didn‚Äôt mention anything about Valium being potentially addictive. I only plan to use it 2-3 times a week just until I can train myself to sleep without having panic attacks and throwing up. Is 2-3 times a week alright? 

P.s. I‚Äôve never had any kind of medication for anxiety until now, this is my first time using anything for it as I‚Äôve reached a breaking point of panic attacks 5-10 times daily & sometimes not eating for multiple days. I‚Äôm just worried that I‚Äôll fix my problems but become addicted.

We've been looking forward to this trip for so long and now I'm just a ball of anxiety thinking about the things that could go wrong. Any advice for dealing with these feelings? Tips on preventing ailments before/during vacation? It's all I can think about at the moment. I feel so ""paranoid."" "
699,Elevated Heart Rate,"Ever since I had gotten of Metoprolol a month ago I‚Äôve been still have an elevated heart rate here and there. Some days better than others, I‚Äôve tried to tell my pcp and cardiologist I haven‚Äôt had this feeling prior to getting on beta blockers when it was giving to me in the ER a month ago, my heart rate went up after they gave me antibiotics in my IV. Are there any medications out there that aren‚Äôt beta blockers that‚Äôs been great for keeping the heart rate at a normal a level. And not cause any terrible side effects after getting off it. Etc.

Word vomiting and getting teary eyed because I love my coworkers but the job is eh and the pay ain‚Äôt enough. I went on and on and I should have shut my trap. She‚Äôs going to talk to my boss about different options / positions but no promises. I already accepted a job I don‚Äôt want to go to & handed my papers in. I just felt like such a failure being a burden on my fianc√© and his family because I don‚Äôt make enough and I‚Äôm not good enough. I‚Äôm really worried about leaving this job and getting a new job. Sometimes I think I‚Äôd do much better off as a lady who lives in the woods.. just needed to say this to someone and word vomit on the internet because I never learn. Nightyall"
701,Concerned,"I‚Äôm 26 years old. 6‚Äô1 about 205 lbs. always been fairly healthy, bp always normal, a fairly moderate diet. So about 3 months ago I had what is being called a ‚Äúpanic attack‚Äù while driving. Just a normal day, went to the gym then to work and all of a sudden I felt light headed, shaky, head and extremities were tingling and I was fighting to breath.Went to the ER of course bc it felt like a heart attack just to be sent home with ‚ÄúGERD‚Äù. While I do have GERD symptoms what‚Äôs going on doesn‚Äôt feel like gerd to me. I‚Äôve had acid reflux my whole life but now it‚Äôs like an every day thing. I followed up with my PC and she thinks it‚Äôs anxiety. Followed up with a GI and they did an endo and ultrasound to find minor inflammation. Nothing alarming. Followed up with a cardiologist, did multiple EKG‚Äôs, did a stress test which both came back great. Did an echocardiogram to find that my LV EF was mildly reduced at 45-50%. The cardiologist advised me that she was somewhat puzzled because I didn‚Äôt show any symptoms, all my labs were great and I seemed to be young and healthy and all of my tests were normal. She has me on a diuretic for the past month and says EF does get better. Besides all that, I‚Äôve been having weird symptoms that haven‚Äôt gone away or changed over time. The panic attack symptoms still come and go usual triggered by driving, acid reflux has gotten worse almost an every day thing now. I sometimes catch myself as I‚Äôm falling asleep feeling dizzy and I wake up and feel my body pulsing , once I open my eyes and change position it goes away. I sometimes have random twitching muscles in my chest on either side, they are muscular because I can actually feel them jumping with my hand. My veins are much more noticeable in my hands during the day as well. Random sharp pains in my body throughout the day happen as well. I feel strange most of the time now. Just generally feel unwell. There are a lot more minor symptoms but I guess my question is what could all of this be? I‚Äôve never dealt with anything like this in my life until that one day when this all started. I have 2 kids and it‚Äôs slowing me down in my career and as a father. I just want life to get back to normal. "
702,I find out in a few days if I have a major chronic health condition. I‚Äôm absolutely terrified and can‚Äôt control my anxiety,"So I(28m) found out I might have a serious chronic health condition. Not something that is going to make me drop dead right now, but depending on if I have it and how it progresses, it could possibly cut my life short by 30 years, depending on how severe it is I might not even make it to 50-60. 

I‚Äôve had other health scares but this has been the worst. My severe health anxiety mixed with my fear of death has not been helping. I haven‚Äôt been leaving my room for 3 weeks since I found out I might have it, barely eating, not paying attention to my gf, sleeping all the time. I feel like since my dr told me he wanted to run the test my symptoms have gotten way worse due to my anxiety. 

Has anybody else had a health scare like this or been diagnosed with a severe chronic health condition? How do you cope? I really have no idea what to do, especially if the diagnosis is true. Any advice is appreciated. "
703,Scrapped or scratched uvula.  Will I throw up?,I just had dinner and it felt like i still had food on the roof of my mouth.  I looked back there with a flashlight and saw a red mark on my uvula.  I'm a little nervous that it will cause me to vomit.  
704,I'm not eating properly - At what point should I be seriously concerned?,"I live in a house with serval roommates, where we mostly keep to ourselves. I've got to the point where I don't venture outside of my bedroom during the day, as I don't want to encounter anyone. However, this makes basic things difficult. 

It's a challenge to access the bathroom, only daring to go like once or twice a day. When I do, I'm waiting for the hallway to clear.With food, I've become too tired to cook late at night like I used to. Currently, its been 48 hours and I've only eaten some chocolate bars readily in my room. I don't know if I'll reach the 72 hour mark without eating so much as breakfast.

At what point does depression become a danger to your physical wellbeing? Should I get outside help, or is this a bad phase that will pass and I can get through it on my own terms?"
705,Why am I sabotaging myself?,"I am not even sure if I have anxiety or if this is some kind of deep laziness and procrastination, but here goes:

I should really be looking for a new job as I have been unemployed for past few months. The process is simple, just clicking online and sending CVs - but I feel so much anxiety, that I am not able to do that properly. I mean I only do bare minimum.

It has gone so far that during last week I was not able to leave my place and am staying in bed, because I feel safe there. 
Everyday I am convincing myself that it will get better, but it‚Äôs not. I am also avoiding people and any form of communication (apart from family, but I am pretending I am fine).

And it really does not make any sense - I am quite successful person and have everything going for me.
In the past, I was able to turn my life around when needed (eg losing lot of weight), I am persevering (eg hiking) and challenge my fears regularly (mostly via ourdoor activities - eg overcoming fear of hights).

But this time‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs like I was sabotaging myself. I feel stuck and frozen. And I am sooo afraid of failure‚Ä¶ to the point I am not really trying to get the job interview first.

It‚Äôs like I feel unable to contribute to society professionally, despite my previous job where I was supervising several other people and prior to that position, training all newcomers.

I don‚Äôt think it is depression, but I really feel anxious and stressed and without any energy.
All I want to do is mindlessly scroll or sleep and don‚Äôt think about anything really.

Yes, this too shall pass, but I don‚Äôt know when and what the collateral damage would be until it does.

Please, tell me how do you overcome such times? What does help you to get from the funk?"
706,Upping my dose from 30 mg to 60 mg,"Diagnosed with GAD 10 years ago..Ive been on 30 mg of Duloxetine DR for years now. Last time I saw my doctor they upped it from 30 MG to 60 MG because they determined I have severe depression and anxiety. I also have clonopan for emergencies. I started Feb 8th and the past 2 weeks Ive noticed tiny changes like more energy, slightly improved mood...but I know it can take 6-8 weeks for it to fully take effect. How long did out take for your medication to really work for you? I miss the old me :("
707,Are you honest with your employer about anxiety? ,"I was honest about my anxiety for literally the first time ever in my job today and I feel like such a weight has been lifted. I am an engineer and recently got a promotion - good news for most and yes it‚Äôs more money, but it‚Äôs also more responsibility and now includes phoning stakeholders for about 40% of my job. 

Honestly if I knew this would be coming with the new role, my anxiety probably wouldn‚Äôt have even let me accept the promotion. I have general anxiety disorder which is under much better control than it has been before thanks to therapy and medication, but phone calls are and always have been the thing that send me into a complete anxiety spiral. I have done a lot of things in my life despite anxiety, I am relatively successful in my job despite anxiety, I have even given birth under an incredibly stressful emergency situation, yet phone calls are STILL the thing I struggle with the very most. Picking up the phone is marginally easier than making a call for me but all of my responsibility here is making calls. Usually to not very receptive or particularly kind people as well, without going into specifics. 

Anyway, today I got hit with another 40 phone calls to make in one day, and I just crumbled. I went straight to my line manager and explained how hard I find doing this, how embarassed I am to admit that but how it‚Äôs not fair on the company for me to
pretend that they can expect a normal level of output for me doing this kind of task since it‚Äôs so much more of a challenge with my anxiety. Give me a task where I can plug my headphones in and hyper focus (I also have adhd) for 8 hours and you‚Äôre golden, but this is so far from my strong suit. We spoke about accommodations and how to make this easier and I just feel so relieved. I still have a high level of anxiety as I am still required to make the calls, but I‚Äôm getting help to take the volume of calls down a little bit, and I am also able to work from home on busy call days since being in the office and doing it in front of people just makes this situation ten times worse. I still feel sick about going to work tomorrow and doing what I need to do, but I at least feel like I‚Äôve got it off my chest and I don‚Äôt have to pretend to have the same level of function as those without this level of anxiety now. I‚Äôll try my best, and I really will, but I‚Äôm trying to give myself some grace too. This is really hard, I‚Äôm hoping it gets easier the more I do it. My energy is absolutely depleted right now though. 

Does anyone relate to this at all? Have you spoken to your employer about anxiety like this and how did it make you feel? Also if anyone has any tips or tricks for feeling more confident with phone calls when you have anxiety I would be so grateful to hear them thank you.

711,"Moved across the country 10 years ago, now I'm suddenly homesick","Back in 2014, when I was a spry 32-year-old man with a lust for life, I took a job opportunity 2,400 miles away from where I'd spent the entirety of my life up until that point. I put my house that I had been the proud owner of since age 24 and that I had cultivated so many precious memories with onto the market, and hit the road with my cats across the country to settle into my new apartment-renting lifestyle.

  


Now I'm 42 and feel like the last ten years were a complete regression. I have no friends. I hate my job. I can't stand my coworkers. I hate my shitty studio apartment. I used to have a nice beefy savings account that always had me feeling like I was sitting on a cloud of safety, now I'm living paycheck to paycheck and feel like I'm a banana peel slip away from everlasting doom. I'm exhausted, and I miss just about everything about how my life felt before I moved. 

  


I am constantly fantasizing about my old home (which sold way back when, so it's not like I'm ever going to return there). Almost every dream that I can remember takes place in that house, or some form of it. 

  


All this misery and throw on top of it the unyielding guilt I constantly endure of having moved away from my parents in the last years of their lives.

  


It's insane how quickly ten years passed. It feels like a dream. I get tearful just thinking about how amazing it would be if I woke up and it was 2014 and I never actually left."

715,Missing Sentimental Items,"I inherited all of my grandmother's old photographs spanning from the 1870s to 2000s and I am always on top of making sure they're there. I realized that a few originals are missing from certain albums (I have scans of them) and I am freaking out and having panic attacks, which are also impacting me at work. 

I don't understand where I could've put them and I keep thinking that I somehow mistakenly threw them away, which I don't get how that would happen. Or that my parents accidentally tossed them. I might have other original copies but the guilt is eating me alive. My grandmother kept these safe for decades and I, the history major, who prided myself on being extra careful with historical items comes around and messes it all up. I just don't understand how I could do such a thing, especially as I love photography. I regret even looking at them as I feel I just destroy what I touch... I suffer from anxiety/panic disorder and I just cannot stop panicking. Thankfully I have an appointment with my psychologist tomorrow but am out of anxiety meds so I am suffering. Sorry for venting.

716,"The Chicken or the egg, A Heart Anxiety Story.","PACS PVCS SVTS AFIB SVE LBBB RBBB THIS, THAT, THIS, THAT!

Stop for the love of God.

Let me tell you about my story, you do not need to know my name, age or anything but what I will tell you about is an experience about what you guys may call ""cardiophobia"" which is a fancy way of saying ""I hate heart related symptoms or things happening to my heart"".

The story: Well first off, I dealt with anxiety my whole life but that took a drastic turn one day in a gym class in middle school during a game of dodgeball. I was running around like everyone else and then my chest sunk in and it took my breath away. My heart started pounding faster and faster. I called for my teacher ""I think I am having a heart attack!"". In that moment I am laying on the ground. He slaps his smart watch onto me and he says I had a ""heart palpitation"". Never heard of such thing and my heart rate was at 200bpm.

I drank water at the nurses office and it went down gradually, went home after this and kinda laughed it off. Odd thing is I started getting mad that those around me were thinking I was having a panic attack for some reason but I was playing dodgeball? I wasn't anxious? wtf?

I then started researching on google and this has gone on for around 5-6 years now. I have been stuck on one thing and one thing only and that is ""SVT"", saying to myself ""yup that's gotta be what I have, those damn nurses don't know shit nor do those cardiologists"".

But what made me think it was SVT? One episode of whatever you just experienced couldn't have convinced you you have something?

Well that is because every day after that I started getting palpitations, which feel like skipped beats but except they wouldn't race like that. Just a 3 second skip that takes your breath. But I have had a couple of those episodes again except they were slightly different.

One time I was leaving the workout room at school and someone told me to leave because it was closed. I got mad and was about to start doing it in the hallway when I got the same sensation as last time. This was my biggest episode which lasted a good 20mins, nurses telling me to calm down but my heart rate would not lower from 200. I was as pale as a ghost and then suddenly it ended when I got what felt like a skipped beat but at the end which made it go down almost suddenly to normal and instantly I jump out of the chair I was laying in during whatever this episode was and going crazy over how it ended suddenly like that. I never experienced anything like it in my entire life.

Nurses proceed to tell me anxiety because I said I got mad at someone this time but was this really a panic attack? everything lines up with ""SVT"", what are these fucking bozos thinking? Sure enough on some other account I make a bunch of reddit posts over this and get a bunch of snarky replies of people saying ""Oh yes my svt episode started like this yadayada"" or ""Oh that sounds like afib"" or ""Oh thats just a panic attack and all that is very normal"".

Makes me freak out and then I see normal posts of people complaining about usual palpitations/skipped beats which makes me really calm for a day or two and I just scroll through this subreddit of course then see posts of people who do complain of palpitations but in some cases you come across the one who doesn't address that they have svt or afib or some other heart problem and they post on here ""Oh I had a panic attack and my heart was fluttering like doves!"", initially make me feel good until I realize that they say in some other post on their profile they got some heart electrical problem that they want to pretend is just anxiety.

Moral of the story: Despite being cleared by doctors and the slight possibility that I have some horrible electrical issue with my heart and need catheters shoved into my fucking veins I quite literally do not know what I have nor do I give a shit anymore unless I drop dead or have some crazy episode where docs can confirm my anxiety as being cause by some underlying heart issue. Cardiologist brushed me off after getting all the testing and holter because she is full with other people complaining with palpitations and also not having real issues to her knowledge. What I should do is trust my Cardiologist and she did acknowledge the possibility if I had this and she just said a couple of her patients do have it but they dont need meds or surgery at all and it will remain that way for the rest of their life."

719,Advice for loss of appetite ,"I (21F) was diagnosed with general anxiety disorder when I was in highschool, but other than the manageable yet unpleasant stress before presentations or evaluations, I was getting by pretty smoothly. I do have emetophobia and possibly autism, although I‚Äôve yet to be assessed,  and found that triggers or sources of stress related to them were also manageable/not very present up until recently. 
Currently, I‚Äôm in university and have found myself more susceptible to react and snowball massively from things like loud noises, busy and crowded areas, the way my body/stomach/throat feels, changes in routine, and struggling to regulate my emotions. My first year in uni was full of meltdowns at home, but I made it through with no panic attacks. 
Recently, however, during my midterm week, I was full of anxiety from the moment I woke up Monday morning. I thought this wasn‚Äôt unusual since I had an exam that day, but soon found I physically couldn‚Äôt bring myself to eat breakfast, as if I had to be up tackling whatever it was that had me anxious. Deciding to just skip breakfast and eat at school, I start my commute by car when only a few minutes in, I feel the tingly hot sensation of a panic attack just take over. I got through it, but the rest of the commute panic attacks just came and went. I managed to get through my exam focused and at ease, and so I thought I was in the clear. I‚Äôm eating my lunch with a friend when I feel the same feeling happening and my appetite was just cut. That loss of appetite remained the same throughout the day, and even throughout the week. It‚Äôs now a week later and things that I previously felt comfortable doing (i.e., eating at my boyfriend‚Äôs house, eating out at a restaurant with my boyfriend) have now become situations where I‚Äôve experienced anxiety and almost full blown panic attacks. I feel myself being hungry, and thinking of food when hungry is normal and something I still do, but the moment I see food my appetite is just gone or incredibly reduced.

I suppose I‚Äôm hoping to get some advice or support from people who have had similar experiences to hopefully overcome this very out of the blue hurdle and go back to being how I was before.

720,Waiting anxiety/fear of a lot of things in my life,"I've had problems with anxiety growing up, but recently things has gotten pretty bad. I live with my parents and help them with everything by working and paying them rent. But ever since July 2023 I've had terrible job luck resulting in me not being able to provide a continuous payment to them to help out. Last job I had I was seasonal so I barely got any hours, I found a job for March that will give me hours coupled with being on Edd (reduced hours) but now Edd claims I made mistakes with certifying my hours and I'm being penalized and I not sure what it exactly means because I can't reach out to anyone to get advice.

I'm scared, because all I can do is just wait and see what happens, but this waiting is hell because there's literally nothing I can do to help fix the situation. If I had just had a regular job that gave me hours I wouldn't be in this situation and would be in a better place. But for now I'm stuck waiting and it's terrifying. If any of you have any advice on how to get through this please, I'm begging please give me some advice."

My mental health feels so down and im might be stressed? BTW, Im the bread winner of the family and im sending my two siblings in college and live pay check to pay check. Im so confused right now.

728,"Didn't know I was experiencing anxiety until I got diagnosed, what is your experience with it?","I talk in length about my unexpected experience with anxiety below but I am very interested in how YOU live it? How does it feel like to you?


---

For some reason I was convinced, both by how the media represents it and what people around me would say, that I couldn't be anxious. I didn't get panic attacks where I would heave, have perpetual racing thoughts of past mistakes or conversation or be in an alterned state I could talk to people when I was in crisis. My friends would even comment on how uncharacteristicly calm and impassive my demeanor always was. I did feel similarly. I'm just numb and impassive most of the time right?



I'm very repressed emotionally on the whole. I don't know how to react to the world so I take all it's input in, minimize and reduce it till I can react in my usual small  placid manner to it. But i'm great contrast, there are times my fears and anxiety blows up unexpectedly in very concentrated periods.



My anxiety attacks feel like dread, full body physical dread. As if my rib cage was encased, every part of my body suffocates and I'm emptied out. I can't move, or at feel like I can't move at all. I keep doing repetitive actions to calm me down but something stops me from moving again like in a transe. Sometimes it stems from something real that brings anxiety, sometimes in morphs into some weird nonsensical paranoid fears , like an awake sleep paralysis where the source of my fears isn't materialized even in my own mind.
I can snap out of it if someone comes to me sometimes, or I just stay unmoving for hours and hours.



So yeah I was quite surprised to hear this would be anxiety, not what I thought it was from how people consider it, with panic attacks and constant racing thought, or logical explanation to their fears. How do you feel experience anxiety?"

I'm so terrified when he's away from me that I keep being selfish knowing I'll feel better if he stays home with me. And I just did it again. No I don't want him to leave but I can't stand feeling so scared again. I like a terrible, incredibly selfish person. I don't want him to hate me. I'm so scared he might already.

733,Gaining Weight while being Anxious,"Hi, I'm an 18M who has been a vegan for about 5 to 6 years now and has never really liked any animal products, but ever since I first started getting bad anxiety I've lost a considerable amount of weight bare in mind I was relatively underweight before being anxious and vegan.

734,Time passing and the expanse of the Universe fills me with dread,"A little background.  
I am a Male 21 year old, I moved out last year and am now starting my adult life with my partner. I have started my career in a sense and am still in school to help move that career forward. I am studying biology, recently my classes have started focusing on the past, (I.E. the start of the Earth ect.) And I have found myself freaking out in a sense about the universe as a whole. I don't have a problem with death, I know it's a fact of life. But I feel so .... I don't even know how to explain it, I just have this overarching sense of dread and it leads to a flair up in my depression symptoms. The idea that I am 2 decades into my life and still feel unsure about my existence is terrifying. It also doesn't help that my partner has a chronic health problem that might end up killing them around age 50-60. Time as a concept makes me uneasy and leads to me shutting down for awhile to calm down is disruptive to my day to day life. I already feel like I am wasting my life and feel a sense of dread when thinking about the future, climate change, the economy, rising political tension, It all feels like there isn't a good reason to keep trying. I am not suicidal, but I am in a sense ""hopeless?"" I do not like that word, as I do have hope for the future however small. Anyway, tangent over, with my studies I am facing the fact of time and that every second spent is gone and I am unable to get it back. The scale of the universe gives me such dread that I end up in a state where I am unable to function for a little. Even finishing a book that has a set structure of gods and systems (Brandon Sanderson's Mistborn saga) Where the main characters end up actually talking to the ""gods"" of their world, it brings up these feelings again. I am not religious but am envious of how religious people seem to have a better grip on this whole meaning. I've done basic research into some religions to see if any speaks to me to maybe latch on to them and find solace, but have come up empty. I have a inkling that spiritualism might be for me as it feels like it might be closer to what I am looking for, but I am not sure.  
Have any of you struggled with the burden of existence? If so, what helped you come to terms with the universe?  
TLDR: I am studying the origin of life and find myself in a state of panic and dread when confronted with the fact that time keeps going on and I am powerless in the face of it. As well as the expanse of the universe and my place in it. Help."
735,Almost bugged out over heights when crossing a bridge.,"I've walked across bridges many times, and this particular bridge at least 10 or so times.  I would say I have a healthy or normal fear of heights.  I ride coasters and other rides and of course they're scary, but that's part of it.  In the past when I have crossed this and other bridges I have given a few looks over the side and felt a ""Whoa"" a few times, but ignored it and thought of other things and strolled on.  A week ago I even crossed this same bridge when it had some snow and ice on the walking surface, and I had little problem.

Last night after I caught a bus into a neighboring town, the next bus wasn't for a while, so I decided to walk a few miles home, including going over this bridge.  As soon as I stepped on it, I started getting anxiety about the height both over the land portion and over the water.  I could feel the height in my head and was getting the notion of what if I wobbled too much and went over the side.  It gave me a physical reaction such that I was struggling to keep myself upright; I wanted to sink down to the ground.  I deal with anxiety, but I've never had a physical reaction quite like this.  It was concerning that I couldn't shake the fear.  I kept going but stayed towards the concrete barrier with the road on the bridge and didn't look over the side.  It was a weird and alarming experience."
736,Sensory/fidget toys & headphones recommendations?,"Hopefully this is the right tag, haha! 

Hey everyone! A bit of context: i am a 24F who has struggled with anxiety ever since I was a child. Got diagnosed with GAD in 7th grade. Lately, my anxiety has really reached a peak.

I have recently tried sensory/fidget toys, and I kinda realized that they do help. Took me this long to even bother with them because I was embarrassed and felt like a child. My question for you guys: what sensory/fidget toys do you recommend? Im new at this, and Im not even sure what I like. I know for a fact I dont like anything sticky, lol! Anything else is a go

Right now, I just fidget with my comfort plush's ears & tail (its a cat). I also have Bobs Burgers squishes (nonsticky, more like a stress ball) that i really enjoy.

Also! I have started using headphones during outings. This helps with sensory issues BUT i have CPTSD and wearing headphones scares me due to not being able to keep track of all of my surroundings. Does anyone have a trick for this? Advice maybe? I dont play music or anything in my headphones, i just wear them. 

TL;DR: any recommended fidget/sensory toys? Advice on wearing headphones in public for sensory issues but also cptsd?"

I feel lost. I know what to do but as I said Im scared to move on and build my life. I'm miserable bc everyone in my life move on, have a job, know more or less what to do with their life. Life is not for me, I'm convinced about that. I'm not important for people as they are for me. I hope that everything will end soon.

I get slight ocd so I have to step on something or shower correctly otherwise it will replay in my head or I'll think I've cursed myself or made deal with devil because I didn't do an intrusive thought
My head will feel so busy sometimes it will explode with thoughts and I'll hear them. I'll literally feel so bad and so anxious for no reason. I will go on walk and still feel just as bad and be so sensitive to everything. Mysic won't help, socializing won't, phone won't. It will go the next day normally. 
When falling g asleep my head will get very loud and ill think shit I can't sleep ever as I outhtought the process. Or I'll get scared Ill hallucinate. I'll see things with eyes closed sometimes and stare at it and open eyes snd it will fade slowly I've had sleep paralysis too a few times and scared Ill go schizophrenic in am episode or get trapped or stop breathing. 
I get scared everything is going to disappear and I'll be transported back to real life or it will all just fade. I read about the lamp dream and scared that will happen to me where I realise im dreaming. 
I met a guy too and I couldn't get wet as I was so anxious for sex. I'm trying to lose weight to be better looking abd confident. He gas 6 pack. I have fat and no tits or arse. I'm very awkward size. Why I'd he seeing me?! I get scared ge us either player, stalker or I've imagined him lol.

I put all my eggs in one basket for him as I believe in true love.... but again let down..... did watching Disney as a child make me nieve to the facts of life that most people are not as pure... I just get hurt time and time again.... and it's so upsetting to me as I would never break loyalty... if I love someone my eyes just for them... even when they are a pain in the butt.
I hit rock bottom and where are they?? And they wish they just want me to be back to bubbly me... how? When I'm left in my room.
My dream of living with the love of my life came to a end due to his addiction... now I'm currently going to be homeless and get a place on my own... it's not what I wanted... but I can't keep sitting in my room.... I can wait for a miracle as I always believed in hope and miracles.... but look where that has got me in life nowhere just a broken tortured soul. I always think right that's it I'm going to not care as much for people as they don't care for me.... that last like 2 mins and I apologise I'm sorry sorry. I get told to toughen up, your sensitive etc etc but why should this world full of selfish change me into somthing I'm not... but being me is a living nightmare. So looks like I'm best being on my own with animals, I do this before to avoid hurt.... opened my heart and let down in worse possible way betrayal... how can I trust after that."

I‚Äôve had pneumonia before because of a genetic lung disease and even the doctors say I‚Äôm gonna be perfectly fine but I can‚Äôt get the thought out of my head that I‚Äôm going to die from it.

750,One year since my first Anxiety Attack. I am doing just fine! But I learned a lot the hard way. AMA if you want.,"I will keep it as short as possible. There is A LOT to say but maybe it would be better if I made a video instead of writing a book.

  
Feb 21, 2023 I had my first ever panic/anxiety attack. I was 20.

  
Hit me out of ""seemingly"" no where. I was just writing some code, working on a project and all of a sudden, I feel like something wrong. Like I'm about to faint, yet perfectly conscious. It felt like my mind suddenly stopped freaked out over something and I didn't know what. I went to lay down, checked my blood pressure, everything was fine, but every part of my body told me otherwise.

  
For the next 3 months, I experienced something I never experienced before. Anxiety.

Anxiety is a lot of things. And many times it's different for everyone. I experienced a lot of troubles sleeping, symptoms of anxiety like Globus and heart palpitations, constantly thinking i was going to die and that my body was just going to shut down any minute now. Every few weeks a different symptom revealed itself, all for the first time.

  
Now I say it hit me ""seemingly"" out of nowhere because in fact, there was a lot of things I was doing wrong. When I fixed them, what do you know, the anxiety went away, practically for good.  
  
1. Going to sleep late, many nights around 2am, watching youtube or scrolling through reddit.  
2. Lack of exercise, spent too much time playing games and working on projects on the computer.  
3. Limiting my social interaction with people.  
  
Going to sleep late meant waking up late, which means eating less throughout the day, or eating at improper times. If I had to get up early, then I wouldn't get enough sleep. And the sleep that I did get normally from 2am to 10am, is not good quality sleep as someone would get from 10pm to 6/7/8 am.  
My lack of exercise meant my body was slowly getting weak. Blood wasn't flowing as well as it should be. Lack of energy. Always in a tired, isolated mood.

  
Avoiding meeting up with people just because they weren't my friends or I didn't know them meant I was always alone. And to be honest, I like that still. I'm introverted and I like my alone time. But at least now, I don't mind going to visit someone I don't know. I now look at it as an opportunity to meet a new friend, or increase my network of connections.

  
I fixed all of these things about myself. Started going to sleep earlier and earlier gradually until I went to sleep around 10pm every day and waking up around 9am the next.  
I started to exercise daily or every other day by going to the park and playing basketball, doing workout at home, and going out for walks more.

  
It is Feb 26, 2024. I haven't had an anxiety symptom in months. I feel less stressed. And I developed better habits as a result. As funny as it sounds, anxiety was a blessing in disguise. It was my wake up call to fix my self before it was too late.

  
Anxiety isn't for life. It is scary, it is difficult to deal with, but it is treatable."
751,Constantly checking heart rate and scared of a stroke or heart attack since my last doctors visit friday. ,"I had a panic attack that morning hours before the doctors visit (not related to the doctors visit i honestly couldnt find an underlying cause for it). I knew that i needed to calm down before they take blood pressure so i did a couple deep breaths closed my eyes and she said ‚Äúis your blood pressure normally this low?‚Äù (She got 100/80) And that scared me. I told her no but im scared now. She retook it and said ‚Äú140/80 so a little high‚Äù. My doctor came in we talked she said she could tell i was nervous and that it was probably just me being anxious. She said go home and check it the next day my normal is 120-130/80 and i got 130 on the dot. But im still not satisfied with a normal reading. Im constantly checking my heart rate (even when i dont notice my heart beat i still put my hand over my chest), googling why i am feeling any type of feeling (dry mouth etc etc). Constantly googling what a normal heart rate is (despite my doctor telling me what mine is normally), and i havent smoked weed since friday (typically when anxious i dont wanna smoke) its weird because i dont feel panic but i still have all the symptoms of my anxiety.

752,Lithium: Works against mania but increases depression?,"Hi, Lit friends

Someone else started taking Lithium and felt that it works very well against mania (interrupting the episodes of euphoria) but instead of maintain some stablished humor between the ‚Äúnormal‚Äù or even neutral, it increased the feeling of sadness/unhapiness and the habit of cry/urge to isolate yourself?"
753,Having difficulty talking with my family about my anxiety because they're the cause of my anxiety,"In this case, it's not because of anything they've done wrong or because they've aggrieved me, but just because I'm scared of losing them through things like age or accidents/illness and I can't shake my worries even though there's nothing imminently severe going on health wise in my family right now other than them being in the older age range.

My family is what I'd describe as non-verbal by nature, we don't typically have long conversations with one another or frequently share our feelings with one another but when my mother for instance notices me showing what must be my nervous tics for the anxiety I'm feeling I just tell her nothing's wrong and that I'm fine because I feel like if I share what I'm feeling that I'd just break down crying and it will be like infecting her with my anxiety which I would never want to wish on anyone.

I can't tell if I'm just emotionally repressed and shouldn't feel reluctant to talk about how I'm feeling, or if I should consider seeing a therapist first to have someone to talk with."
754,Anxiety controls every waking moment of my life ,"I wake up with brain fog and in a heightened state of awareness. Most of the time I self isolate at home. I have some money I live off of and if I'm lucky I can do some at home work every 2 weeks. My ADD is so severe I can't barely ever start on anything. Even writing this post took me 25 minutes of staring at the screen. But every ADD med gives me panic attacks and anxiety. 

From the minute I wake up to the minute I go to bed I'm thinking about how I can avoid a panic attack or anxiety. If I do make it out. I have to take a Xanax and only stay out for 3-4 hours before it wares off and my agoraphobia kicks back in. On the weekends usually I can pump myself so full of booze the anxiety goes away for a night. Even if it comes back the next day even harder. 

I'm tired all the time. Barely socialize or work and panic with anxiety runs my life. I'll probably never work again, never have a meaningful relationship and certainly won't travel on my own due to agoraphobia. I'm really lost at this point because I've tried meds with no luck and ""exposure and CBT"" hasn't worked either. I'm at the end of my rope and just needed to rant. Thanks. "
755,Anxiety Upon Waking and Unsettling Dreams??,"I just came on here to talk and maybe see if other people have experienced something similar. 

I have been waking up with really bad anxiety lately. I thought that it was because i was waking up before the sun came up and I did that alot during my terrible internship experience, so I thought it was an innate reaction to that. However, because of the time change, I‚Äôm waking up when the sun is already up and nicely shining into my room, but I‚Äôm still incredibly anxious.

I wake up with a sense of dread almost. And I can‚Äôt tell what it is that I‚Äôm anxious about. Am I just anxious to go out into the world? Am I anxious while I‚Äôm sleeping and dreaming?

I tend to have really detailed dreams, but they aren't usually terrifying. Like, they don‚Äôt typically wake me up, but they do tend to stick with me throughout the day and I kind of get a sickening feeling when I think about them. And sometimes my dreams don‚Äôt even seem to be about anything particularly scary, but it usually still disturbs me somehow.

I can‚Äôt tell if my ‚Äúsupposedly‚Äù benign dreams are actually causing me to wake up anxious or if its from something else. I‚Äôd like to find an answer to it, so I can try to tackle the morning anxiety.

Also, side rant: I had a really disturbing dream last night. It wasn't outright terrifying, but it did leave me super unsettled upon waking. I grew up with an angry and unpredictable father and my parents fought a lot. I now have PTSD because of it. I had a dream that we were all together at a restaurant and they started fighting there and, in their anger, they just got up from the table and left me there alone. I don‚Äôt know why this is bothering me so much. It seems like such a stupid dream to be so anxious over, but does anyone else have experience with this? Does anyone else have childhood trauma that comes through in their dream in unexpected ways? I guess I always think of PTSD nightmares being violent and waking you up, which I hardly ever experience, but does anyone have any experience with having untypical PTSD nightmares. I guess I just don‚Äôt know what they look like for everyone?

756,Need some guidance/help,"Hi everybody,

I‚Äôve been on a 2 year journey trying to figure out what‚Äôs wrong with me and have gotten nowhere with doctors. All my symptoms started in the middle of the night 2 days after having a very minor elbow surgery (tinnitus came 2-3 months later). Before this day I was perfectly healthy and had no issues in life.

I am suffering from the following symptoms:

Tinnitus (most annoying)

Fatigue

Heart palpitations 

Vision issues (seeing tiny lazer dots in vision)

Nasal problems (congestion)

Muscle twitching

Dizziness? (room doesn‚Äôt spin but feels like I‚Äôm walking on a boat)

Muscle tension (especially in back of neck and lower back)

Dissociation 


‚Ä¶.there are other minor symptoms but these are the big ones.

I have had 100‚Äôs of blood tests done over the years as well as full cardiac workup, brain MRIs, and many more. Everything always comes back normal. It‚Äôs extremely confusing.

After having all these tests come back normal, doctors are starting to suggest that my symptoms are somatic and related to anxiety? Normally, I‚Äôd listen to my doctors advice but‚Ä¶..I don‚Äôt feel anxious‚Ä¶..at least nothing out of the ordinary. 

My doctor is telling me that I could have purely physical anxiety? I don‚Äôt really understand how that‚Äôs even possible‚Ä¶to have this extreme of a physical reaction but to no feel it mentally? Does anybody here have something similar? I don‚Äôt know where to turn.

The doctors have prescribed me these medications so far:

Propanolol - helped with heart palpitations but nothing else

Hydroxizine - did nothing, maybe made fatigue worse

Clinazapam: took it for a week, seemed to make tinnitus slightly less but didn‚Äôt help anything else

759,Overcoming Swallowing Phobia: My Journey and Tips for Others,"Hey everyone,  
I wanted to share my experience dealing with swallowing phobia in the hopes that it might resonate with some of you facing similar challenges. For a while now, I've struggled with swallowing food, constantly feeling like I might choke. It's a terrifying feeling, isn't it?  
I started questioning if there was something neurologically wrong with me, but after some introspection and medical checks, I realized it was a deeper issue. It's like my body was on high alert, tensing up every time I tried to swallow, especially after a night of drinking or when sleep-deprived.  
I suspect my enlarged turbinates played a role, making it harder to breathe properly, especially when eating fast. But regardless of the cause, the fear of choking consumed me during meals. It's that split-second panic when food feels stuck in your throat, even though it hasn't entered your airway.  
I began noticing how my body reacted, involuntarily trying to exhale before swallowing‚Äîa primitive instinct to protect myself. It's fascinating how our bodies work to keep us safe, even when it feels like everything is going wrong.  
I sought medical advice, undergoing tests and consultations to rule out any underlying issues. Thankfully, everything came back normal. But overcoming this fear wasn't easy. It's a journey‚Äîone that requires patience and understanding.  
Here are some tips that have helped me along the way:  
Be Patient with Yourself: Understand that healing takes time. Your body and mind need to readjust, and it won't happen overnight.  
Seek Professional Help: Don't hesitate to consult with doctors, therapists, or psychologists who specialize in anxiety and phobias. Their guidance can be invaluable.  
Take Small Steps: Break down meals into smaller bites and chew thoroughly. Drinking water with meals can also ease the swallowing process.  
Practice Relaxation Techniques: Learn techniques like deep breathing or progressive muscle relaxation to calm your body's response during meals.  
Educate Yourself: Books like ""The Psychology of Fear"" by Christopher Andr√© can provide insights and strategies for managing anxiety.  
Express Yourself: Consider journaling or ""morning pages"" to unload your thoughts and fears. Sometimes, getting it all out on paper can be cathartic.  
Explore Medication: If sleep issues contribute to your swallowing phobia, discuss options with a healthcare professional. Medication may help improve sleep quality and reduce anxiety.  
Remember, you're not alone in this struggle. It's okay to seek support and take proactive steps towards healing. Believe that you can overcome this obstacle, one step at a time. I'm still on my journey, but I'm hopeful for better days ahead.  
Stay strong, and take care. You've got this."
760,Everyday anxiety,"Hi all! I just joined this group in hopes of someone being able to help or give advice. I‚Äôve been anxious everyday for the past 4 months or so. My mind will fixate on something to be anxious about, that‚Äôll go away for a bit and my anxiety will lessen, now my brain has fixated on the fact that I‚Äôm going crazy. I know that I‚Äôm not but my brain keeps convincing me that I‚Äôm going crazy. I‚Äôve noticed I‚Äôve been out of it, trip up on my words when I talk, forget things more frequently and everytime something like that happens my brain convinces me it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm crazy.

761,Bubbly feeling in left lung while exhaling ,"To start with I was diagnosed with Hashimoto's, had some tests done a few months ago and everything is fine(outside of TAT and MAT obviously) I've been drinking Selen, which is what I believe for some reason helps my heartrate not be too strong(which is how I found out I had it).

So usually when I need to go on an antibiotic for some unrelated reason (as it is right now-a throat infection) the heartbeat will start feeling heavier, sometimes with a bit of an elevated pulse but nothing serious. 

Sometimes I'll feel a very slight 'tremble' on the lower side of my left lung when I breathe more slowly. No pain, no cough or anything thankfully. At first I thought it was my heart, like a palpitation or something. Usually this gets more apparent (or only happens) when I'm chilling at home and therefore have the time to be hyper aware of my heartbeat. I clear my throat, try to cough up whatever I feel is inside but nothing ever comes up.

I should also say that a few months ago I had several ECGs and appointments  to a cardiologist and they all came back normal. Said occasional discomfort may be due to my height and age (I'm young and tall)

Just gonna mention that I have health anxiety so please be gentle guys, refrain from name-dropping scary diseases."
762,Issues starting to get worse ,"Hi Everyone,

Never really opened up about this but thought writing it down might help, feel free to respond with any similar experiences or suggestions.  

I male (20) have had bad anxiety since around 12 years old.  It used to just be really bad in social situations like school and parties.  I was always known as being very quiet, and people who don‚Äôt know me well might think I‚Äôm standoffish or rude.  In reality it feels like I am under immense pressure in any social situation ever, even with friends and family.  My heart races, I sweat, and then just usually end up staying quiet in a corner or trying to leave ASAP.  I have been going to a big college, and getting ok grades, but I often skip class or assignments out of fear.  I haven‚Äôt made any friends but I‚Äôve come to the conclusion that I probably will not be able to without addressing my anxiety first.  Recently my issues have gotten worse, with work/school/money all feel like they are piling on top of me.  My grades are starting to suffer, and my anxiety has shifted from social situations to being nearly constant.  A couple months ago I fainted, and I‚Äôve had several anxiety attacks since then.  I‚Äôve never told anyone, and other than the fact I have no friends probably seem to be functioning normally to my family.  I don‚Äôt know why but I‚Äôm too scared to tell anyone what is really going on, but I just cannot do it.  My fear is that things will start to spiral even worse if I don‚Äôt do anything.  I am pretty close with my family but have issues opening up to anyone and am not sure how they would react if I did.

I guess I‚Äôm really just not sure where to start.  If anyone has any advice or suggestions let me know."
763,AITA,"my partner got this dog (American Akita) around 4 1/2 years ago. She paid for some training when she was a puppy, but as she got older no one stuck with a lot of the training.

I‚Äôve never had great eating habits. I‚Äôve always binged and then I would starve myself and then ‚Äúnormal‚Äù and then binge, etc. and then I wouldn‚Äôt always eat the healthiest things. I had considered myself a food addict honestly. Just because it would be so difficult to not eat certain foods and to not binge and to not always think about food. I ALWAYS think about food. 

And Lately, like within the last year, I‚Äôve been trying to track certain macros in food because of health issues. And it has now created this food anxiety. I have to check for the sodium content, carbs, sugars, fiber, protein. Even in food that I cook myself. And i have to check if something had dairy in it or not. And it gets so exhausting that sometimes I‚Äôll just not eat. And then when I do eat, I get anxious afterwards thinking that the food is gonna give me a heart attack or a stroke. And I know that I‚Äôm doing it to myself. But it‚Äôs hard to get out of that mindset. Especially if I‚Äôm feeling the physical effects. 

It sucks and I just feel like it gets bad some days and this a newer thing I‚Äôve had to deal with. Compared to the food addiction sort of thing. Idk if anyone else has dealt with this. But it is not fun. 

Thanks for letting me share/vent. "
770,I need help dealing with this so badly,"Gonna try to make this short.

I‚Äôm in my first year at university. And so far, it‚Äôs been miserable. I moved into the dorms here in August and haven‚Äôt been the same since. I‚Äôve always had anxiety and the accompanying physical issues (particularly IBS), but they‚Äôve both gotten so much worse since August.

I used to live out in the country on a farm and surrounded by nature before moving here. I loved it there. It was relaxing and I got to spend a lot of time outside. But now I‚Äôm going to school in a city and most of my life is confined to my classrooms or my dorm room. It‚Äôs made me more depressed as well as anxious.

I never wanted to go to college. I don‚Äôt have anything in particular I‚Äôd like to do as a job. But my mother is one of those people that believes that anybody who doesn‚Äôt go to college is a loser that will never get anywhere in life, so she pressured me to go. I told her it‚Äôs pointless, since I don‚Äôt even know what I want to do as a job yet. She doesn‚Äôt listen, though.

Ever since moving here in August, I cry every day. I‚Äôve been extremely suicidal since then as well. I‚Äôve tried to drop out, but nobody in my family supports that decision (except for my older sister, bless her), so if I did drop out, I‚Äôd have nowhere to go. My mom knows I‚Äôm suicidal, but again, she‚Äôs one of those people that sees suicide as weak and selfish, so she gets very angry with me when I open up about my suicidal thoughts and tells me to just deal with it. My dad is a bit more supportive, and while I love him, he‚Äôs very spineless and passive, and often sides with my mother on everything so there‚Äôs no conflict.

I‚Äôve missed so much class since the beginning of the term as well, because my anxiety and depression have gotten so bad I can‚Äôt bring myself to care at all about my classes or my grades. I‚Äôm not failing anything yet, but I‚Äôm pretty close. I find myself daydreaming every day about being back home surrounded by that nature and my animals and just working a simple job.

Currently sitting in my dorm room crying again, even though I have a class I‚Äôm supposed to be at right now. My spring break starts this Friday, and it lasts for ten days. I‚Äôll be staying with my dad over that time, and while it‚Äôs nice I have a break coming up, I find myself already dreading having to come back here once it‚Äôs over.

I just wish I knew what to do. I feel so trapped. I have no other options then to just deal with this I guess."
771,Panic over bridges how do I get over it?,So I developed severe anxiety about 4 years ago now it just started with a panic attack and I couldn‚Äôt hardly leave the house for a while. I got to where I‚Äôm not scared of being out and I can drive fine for the most part now without having to pull over. But I developed a fear of bridges the past year now. So like I can drive over small bridges but when it comes to really long and narrow bridges my heart starts racing and it feels like pvcs or arrhythmia and my mouth feels like static and I feel like I‚Äôm being crushed. But after I get over them I feel normal again. But the pain is so intense that I panic before even driving over them. I start a new job tomorrow about 30 mins from home and to get there and home you HAVE to take these two bridges. The first bridge I can go over fine because there‚Äôs a pull over lane but on the way home the other bridge is super narrow and it‚Äôs a two lane bridge with rails and the traffic is insane there. It‚Äôs the only job to call me back in 6 months. But I‚Äôm terrified of the bridge home. I can‚Äôt go anyway else home and I don‚Äôt want to tell them I‚Äôll just keep looking closer to home. I tried driving over it a few times to try and get the panic to stop but the panic attacks get worse everytime I do it.

The only thing that has worked for me is Xanax and I know that‚Äôs not meant to be a maintenance medication.

So I‚Äôm incredibly anxious about food safety, and last night around 6pm (as I am writing it is currently 1:30pm) a tree fell on our powerline and the electricity shut off. I have a big chest freezer in my garage that was shut tight with heavy items on top to reinforce that the cold air wouldn‚Äôt leave,  and it was about 35 (or less) degrees fahrenheit outside and snowing lightly. My main concern is I had just bought many packages of perishable items, mostly meat products. Raw chicken, precooked meals containing meat, etc. The power came back on around 11:30AM today. Is my food in the freezer still safe to consume? It has stayed around 35-40 degrees out since, but most of the snow has melted.

774,Scared I experienced psychosis‚Ä¶,"What's up I have severe GAD and I am 24 years old in grad school.

I have no family history 

So this story happened about 3 months ago.
I was high alone in my college apartment. I was playing COD with my buddies online. I took way too much edible (145 mg) and this made me very anxious and also took 200 mg of caffeine in my pre-workout. 

So then I thought I heard something and I ripped my headphones off and it sounded like my neighbors/someone in the hallway but I was so high that it made it sound like it was in my apartment.

This made me super anxious, because I thought what I was hearing was not real. .
Then my friends got off and I stayed on because I was super anxious that I would hear something and begged them to stay on because I thought I was going to hallucinate and hear something not real when I took my headphones off. 

Then when I eventually did take my headphones off I was so tired and anxious. This led to me hearing what sounded like intelligible whispers and this made me freak out into a panic attack, because I thought I was in psychosis. 

My tinnitus was so bad (always is when I am high) that I couldn't tell where I was coming from but it sounded like my air purifier. I went to sleep and felt completely normal the next day until I googled schizophrenia symptoms and now I am very anxious about getting it.

Does this sound like psychosis? My psychiatrist and therapist both do not think so. What do you guys think? Does this mean I have underlying mental illness."

778,Frequent heart palpitations ,"Last two days I have been having many skipped heartbeats a day. I could feel them every 10 minutes. I went to ER, they made an EKG (during ekg I did not have palpitations) and took my blood test. 

Troponin levels and proBNP were in a normal range (minimal).

They told me to make an appointment with my cardiologist.

Does it mean that I am fine? I just never had sp much noticeable heart palpitations that it is hard to believe that it is not live threatening. :("
779,Tw: If you have cardiophobia this might make it worst if you read,"I've gotten over my fear of heart attack because I have no blockages whatsoever in my heart, however I am scared of cardiac arrest due to me having risk factors. I have hypertension that ranges from high to super high and I've been trying to combat it but it's a losing battle. I have a mild muscle in my heart they say might be due to the hypertension, it's just mildly thick. I'm 21 and constantly fearing for it now, I don't understand it so I fear it and the thing is I thought if I did research on sudden cardiac arrest I'd feel better but no I don't, some say it's a chance it can just happen and boom ur gone and then some people say it's gonna be a underlying issue, people my age do go into cardiac arrest. About 2,000 people a year in 20s to 30s do and honestly it scary, I'm young and they say hbp doesn't really show damage in your body at least until 30s and I'm already showing signs? But also at the same time they're saying they think it's from hypertension so they don't even really know themselves? Anyone else fighting the fear of this with risk factors?"
780,Skydive heart anxiety,"I've been anxious for pretty much my whole life. I was first diagnosed with a benign heart murmur when I was 10, and ever since, I've had to go to several different cardiologist specialists, all of whom have said that my heart is perfect. Unfortunately, now that I have a skydive booked (it was given to me as a voucher), instead of enjoying the thought of it, I keep thinking about all the things that could go wrong. I've started getting palpitations and have even overthought my heart issues to the point that I've had to book an appointment with another cardiologist. The last time was in 2021; I did a stress test, echo, etc., and was told I had a resting heart rate of 44, which also scared me, but I was told that this is a sign of a healthy heart. Has anybody at all gone through something similar? I obsess about my heart anytime I'm going to do something fun or travel somewhere very remote, and it's really beginning to annoy me."

782,Obsessing over finding something I lost,"Idek if this is the right subreddit for this, but I have a bad habit of obsessing about finding something I lost or misplaced.

It is 4:45AM and I have been looking for my wireless earbuds since around 2:00AM. I'm tired but the thought of not finding it is keeping me up. This happens whenever there's something I'm looking for that I can't find and I lose time because of it. I am not able to do anything else until I find it. I try, but it's really difficult to convince myself to let it go. Sometimes, it gets to a point when I get irritated by everything and everyone getting in my way when I'm looking for the thing that I lost. It doesn't even have to be something very important."
783,I'm afraid my stomach got me fired,"I went into work this morning already not feeling well only about after an hour end suffering from major stomach problems. I tried to have it out till about 1030, for reference I started at 8, when I couldn't do it anymore so I had to reach out to my boss and ask what should I do in terms of policy because I need to go home.

 I have no PTO time, I just started about 6 weeks ago and haven't acquired any yet. He said normally if a person doesn't have PTO time they would have to just take unpaid time but he was willing to do a one time thing and give me the option to work from home which I gratefully accepte

I brought my computer home with me was able to get a good amount of work done, And me going to the bathroom at home looks a lot better than me constantly going to the bathroom at work due to the stomach problems plus I don't want to get anyone sick.

The problem Is my anxiety is telling me that I'm about to get fired because of this especially because I have my 45 day review coming up in about 2 weeks, Even though I've been getting glowing reviews lately this is the one thing that flubbed me up.

787,Need a break from constant anxiety,"In 2001 I had a major trauma from the break up of my marriage. I developed anxiety over that( I loved him with all my heart, and I loved our life, and he betrayed me with another woman, and it crashed me) I was debilitated to the point that I couldn‚Äôt do my job well. My doctor gave me clonzapan. It was like a wonder drug and I was able to ‚Äúsee‚Äù my pain but the anxiety was gone. I was able to function. I was  it as prescribed till  tolerance developed. In 2013 I went on a 19 month taper to get off of it. The taper who was horrendous  and  anxiety came  back and was there during the whole taper. I have been off it for 14 years, and I‚Äôve tried to find other ways to cope and deal, but it is a constant internal shaking. I participate in life, but I am unable to enjoy it  - not even all of my social activities. I have social anxiety around the people I am with, along with the internal shaking, which never goes away. I am now 69 years old and I am wondering if I should suffer like this for the rest of my life and I‚Äôm thinking about going back on so I can be comfortable in my next phase of life. Taking it in a reasonable manner instead of in those increasing the doses, maybe I will be able to function better. Am I just crazy for wanting to trying this again? I so want to feel decent and be able to interact with people without this horrible never ending anxiety. I would love your thoughts, pro and con. PS the reason I went off, is because I was starting to lose my memory. Thanks "
788,I'm tired of anxiety,"Since I'm 6 (at least) i have anxiety. I was probably anxious also before but I don't really remember it. When I was little i was anxious about badly behaving, i was afraid of behaving badly because i didn't know exactly how to behave, that i would get a bad behavior grade (basically it was a system with faces) from my teacher. I was also terrified of not knowing how to read, i did not understand first how i was supposed to do it, how people really did it and i had a small delay but i quickly closed the gap. I only had good appreciations on my behavior. 

I was also terrified of trains (that grew up on me since i'm 11), their noise were just making my heart race. Another problem i had were that i always find things that people say very illogical, i remember that i hated hearing my yoga teacher say that ""pain will make us feel good"", it just made me very uncomfortable and i hated yoga mainly for this reason. I had several anxiety crisis during my childhood where i would hit my head against the wall or slap my face but never saw a psychiatrist or a psychologist until i was 21. My current psychiatrist does not understand why i never saw a psychiatrist younger. I know it may seem like stupids things i was worried about but when i was young i remember being very worried about this... My mother always denied it ever happened but i know it happened and my sister can attest that it happened several times.

I'm just tired of it and i would like to just turn it off. But i don't want to be addicted to benzos either, i'm worried about addiction since i know my mother and my grandmother problem with alcohol... I'm always thinking about every situation, everything that can happen, what would be the worst case scenario, how should i behave in this case, if this happen how should i behave etc... Or what already happened, analyzing everything that happened how i did respond, was it appropriate etc... There always seemed to be something to be worried about. It just feels like i have less energy than the average person and less energy than when i was younger, i try to minimize the amount of energy i have to spend. I told one time my GP that i was always feeling tired at 20 but he laughed at me and said it was normal because of my studies...

A big part of my anxiety is social anxiety, for a long time in my teenage years until 19, i just stayed alone doing things i liked and was basically obsessed with, I stopped having any friends (to be fair my friends before were kinda bad, i think there were sort of pity friends, but i also just did not engage very much when i was friend with them, i never knew what to say to them) after being 12. So I was basically almost alone from 12 to 19. Now, I'm very much more socially engaged, but i kinda feel i was happier when i was alone by myself... "
789,Social fever ?,"Hi everyone. Sorry to bother you but I have a question. 
I will ask my therapist tomorrow because my doctor couldn't give me an answer. 
Since a few months. At the time the first symptom of my anxiety showed up, I started to have what my bf and I call Social Fever. We have no idea what the real name can be, and if it is actually a thing. 
Lemme explain : I (28F) have always been a very outgoign and social person. But two years ago I started having huge pain in the torso, that was later diagnosed as anxiety by my therapist. Around the same time, I started to get these huge Fever after any social / unusual gathering. And when I say huge, I meam the one that knock you down for a few hours, and makes you sick.  Most of the time making me unable to drive back home. 
I just thought I was catching cold or it was exhaustion. 

But we noticed a pattern which is it happens everytime we go on family or friends gathering, with loads of people around. Or very big days with unusual seetings (going to a con, to disneyland, to a bar/restaurant.)
Does this happens to you to ? 

I will definitely check with my therapist tomorrow, but I am genuinely curious as I am currently having one.. 

Anyway. Thank you for your time ! Have a lovely day. "
790,Feeling weird but can't describe it,"Ever since I experienced a TERRIBLE bout of dpdr about a year ago, I get these feelings that last a few weeks that I can never describe.

Anyone else?,"I lay down and sleep normally until about 4-5 in the morning when I start getting these very random and intrusive thoughts and memories and with each one, I have a little anxiety attack until I'm finally a full-blown nervous wreck. A living cortisol/adrenalin factory!.

I keep trying to go back to sleep as more of a form of escape and avoidance than anything else but I'm too wired and on-edge and finally force myself to get up and am a mess for the first half of the day.

What is wierd are the anxiety-triggering thoughts that I sometimes have. Like, I'll suddenly remember some little thing that happened 50 years ago and feel super-anxious about it while I'm laying there half-awake and half-asleep. Then, another memory from maybe 30 years ago and then another and another and then, maybe a brief thought about a rude Nurse or a bill that needs to be paid or whatever and I wake up with really intense anxiety, palpitations, aches and pains, trouble getting a full breath, etc.

Anyone else have mornings like these?. Thank you for reading!."

794,Seeking Advice: Navigating PhD Challenges with Anxiety and Depression,"Since my diagnosis with anxiety disorder and major depression in September last year, my journey as a fifth-year PhD student has been incredibly tough. Despite being in a toxic department‚Äîwhich I recognized in my second year‚ÄîI‚Äôve been determined to persevere, putting in significant effort, especially during my qualifying exams and third year. Unfortunately, the persistent negative environment and a lack of support from my advisor have been overwhelming, leading me to suppress my feelings and struggle alone.

This isolation and stress significantly impacted my motivation and love for research. I developed a fear of reading and writing academic papers, contributing to my lack of publications. My mental health deteriorated, prompting me to seek medical help. Initially, I was prescribed Celexa, which unfortunately caused severe side effects like vomiting, lethargy, and diarrhea. Switching to Agomelatine has improved my mood and motivation, thanks to ongoing support from my family and friends. However, I still face unexplained vomiting episodes, despite my stomach being medically clear.

I‚Äôm reaching out for advice or shared experiences on coping with similar challenges. How can I manage these symptoms and regain my passion for research? Any insights or support would be greatly appreciated."

I had just scored a new job, started new meds (that have been incredible for me and I couldn't be happier with the results) however... this past Tuesday I found on my dog's cancer has returned and he'll need surgery. To make matters worse, I was let go from my job under ridiculous circumstances. I had only worked there for 5 months. Suddenly, it feels like everything I worked for and enjoyed in the past 5 months is gone and my anxiety is back in a bad way. It's 12:31 a.m. as I sit and type this waiting for my Valium to kick in and calm me the fuck down. It's truly sad that employers don't take into consideration the mental stress this situation creates for somebody. Now I not only have to find a new job, but I gotta explain why I only worked at this one for 5 months. I'm stressed out of my mind and wish there was a way back to how I was feeling just short while ago. To make matters worse, I also have a 1 year old son.

797,Breathing exercises don't help?,"I've had two panic attacks in my lifetime (the second one happened yesterday...on a plane! I became the ""is there a doctor on the plane"" person, which was one of my worst nightmares) and both times doing breathing exercises didn't work to calm me down. The first time it was quick and passed in a few minutes, but it seemed that slow/deep breathing triggered it, then made it worse. The second time lasted longer. I was able to get some oxygen and a doctor was helping to coach me to breathe slowly - it seemed to help a bit but I don't know if it was the oxygen or the actual breathing exercises.

I just feel so overwhelmed, tingly/numb/warm, so scared and extremely anxious (of course) during attacks and I find that I can't focus on ""correct"" breathing to have it actually work. I'll start doing it and then I'll think ""it's not working, it's something worse than a panic attack"" and of course that sets me off even worse. Or I'll take a deep breath and have an anxiety spike by thinking that it's not going to work. 

Does anyone have any advice?

Have to add I am not medicated and haven't seen a cardiologist (I did see my primary care doctor after my first attack and after a clear EKG she gave me some hydroxyzine ""just in case"") but I have an appointment this week."

799,Overwhelmed after a Date,"
Hey everyone,

I wanted to share an experience I had yesterday that left my anxiety skyrocketing. I went on a date, and the guy was incredibly sweet‚Äîhe even brought me roses and chocolates. But instead of feeling joy, I was overwhelmed and awkward, unable to properly express my gratitude.

Throughout the evening, my anxiety was relentless. Despite enjoying our time together and feeling warmth in our conversations, I couldn't shake off the fear. So, when I got home, I impulsively decided to end things via text saying that I didn‚Äôt feel the spark im seeking at the moment. I gave myself trivial reasons such as being ""catfished"" or being lied to about his height.

Reflecting on this impulsive decision, I realized it was my anxiety talking. At 21, I've never experienced healthy relationships, so when someone shows me kindness, it's almost foreign to me. I struggle to believe I deserve such gestures, like the flowers he gave me.

This incident isn't isolated. Lately, I've found myself on the verge of tears over small acts of kindness, like when a friend offered me a seat on the metro. It's as if I'm not ready to accept love and kindness into my life.

I know I need to work on accepting myself and allowing others to treat me with the care I deserve, but it's easier said than done. Has anyone else experienced something similar or have tips for coping with overwhelming anxiety in dating situations?

Thanks for listening."

805,Chest pain for months ,I‚Äôm 16 and I had a spell of an eating disorder for 6 months which I finally quit by myself in September. I kept it a secret for a long time and one night I woke up in the middle of the night feeling like I couldn‚Äôt breathe. When I told my mum it eased off a bit which was interesting. But that was just the start. One week the breathing was getting so bad I thought it was sinusitis I literally couldn‚Äôt get a decent breath in. Then chest pain came into the balance. All different types it started off as fluttering constantly which suddenly went in the taxi. I felt like my stomach was twisting and the same thing happened with my chest it went back and forth for a minute and the fluttering gradually subsided. Then an aches of chest pain started to show up as a symptom (this is around October November) my anxiety is the worst it‚Äôs ever been before. Since then the breathing has calmed down a bit but when I think about it it shows up again. Chest pain has happened EVERYDAY for the past 4 months. I‚Äôve been to a doctor twice first one said anxiety second said since i had an eating disorder try omeprazole which I‚Äôve taken for nearly 2 months to find not really any effect except it‚Äôs calmed down a little bit. Interestingly on weekends it is a lot better. Some days it is hardly noticeable some days it is horrible. Also another symptom is a vibrating feeling in my abdominals which freaks me out. Normally after I eat I play football but when I was playing my heart was obviously racing but when I stopped it just suddenly started racing like I was sprinting or something. After a minute it stopped. This has happened around 3 different occasions in the 4 months. I know I‚Äôve written a lot but I‚Äôm at my lowest at the moment and I feel like everyone is getting fed up of me complaining. Please if anyone has anything they think it might be or to re assure me please do.

Then i thought it's just weakness but then i started having panic attacks. But these things would just happen only at night or when i try to sleep. Someone tell me its anxiety. I go to the heart doctor and he prescribes me propranaolol and tells me i might have anxiety but no heart problem.

807,Life with Anxiety,"Hey there, my name is Bobby.

First and foremost, I want to say to everyone in the sub; I don‚Äôt know exactly what you go through, but whatever it is, I pray you find your way. I struggle with issues of my own, and I‚Äôd give anything to take mine or anyone else‚Äôs anxiety away. And God bless you.

This is my first time reading or posting in this community. I was driving to a class that I take for work and I thought, there‚Äôs gotta be other people that feel the way I do on a daily basis.

This isn‚Äôt a post looking for sympathy, I just think I could find some solace in knowing I‚Äôm not the only one is this world that has this gnawing, exhausting anxiety everyday that comes from seemingly nowhere.

I‚Äôm now 28 years old; I‚Äôll be 29 at the end of May. Thinking back now, I can‚Äôt even remember the last time I felt fine. Every day I can expect the same feeling, to a degree. Some days are better, but some days I find myself even struggling to function. I wake up most mornings not wanting to leave the house. I constantly worry about what people might be thinking about me. I fear disappointing people, yet I somehow keep finding ways to do just that. 

Over the years, I‚Äôve been on more medications than I could ever remember or list here. I really hated the way they made me feel; I felt artificial or like the feelings I had weren‚Äôt my own. I‚Äôve also been to several psychiatrists and therapists over the years; but for some reason I just stopped going each time, even if I knew it might help.

Aside from the constant battle with my thoughts in my head about what‚Äôs wrong, what I‚Äôve done wrong, what‚Äôs going to happen, or even just wondering if I‚Äôm cut out for this life, I deal with a serious case of physical anxiety. My heart starts racing horribly, I sweat, I get freezing cold, and I‚Äôm genuinely scared of something I can‚Äôt understand.

This may be absolutely all over place, I just wanted to give some insight into what I‚Äôve been going through."

812,Will I ever get over my sons leaving for college?,"My (50 m) anxiety was triggered almost a year ago at this time when my sons were deciding and accepting to go to college. I didn't realize it at the time it was anxiety because it physically manifested in nausea and a general feeling of stomach discomfort. At the time my Dr precscribed some prilosec, and it did help, but we now think it was just a plecebo. I ended up breaking down one weekend when my wife and sons were away on separate trips. I just felt totally and utterly alone, almost abandonded.

I started seeing an online counselor who was good with teaching me some basic strategies and started me on the therapy path. It was good for a while, but I felt I needed something more and went to an inperson counselor at my Dr's office. She is great and helped me to recognize and deal with some things. I thought I was doing really good in the fall. 

Fast forward to current time. The week before they left after break, I just couldn't stop thinking about the worst case scenarios. They were never coming back, and that I was alone, etc. I was crying every day. I talked to my Dr and she put me on Zoloft for 25mg for 2 weeks, and then I just upped to 50 last week Monday, so I've been on it for 21 days. My wife feels like my sadness has gotten worse. I am crying every day, not all day thankfully, but usually my anxiety builds up and then explodes into a crying bout. Afterwards, I feel really good and everything calms down. 

I feel like the sayings of, get out of the house, and get new hobbies just aren't that great. I have hobbies and I get out of the house. I work from home so I really can't get out too much during the work day. Once a week I go to work from a coffee shop. 

I feel lost, alone, and just fucking sad. It's just emotionally exhausting. Anyone else deal with this? Anyone else that can tell me it gets better? I mean, for FFS, it's been 5 months. "

814,Oversharing with(almost) strangers,"I am generally very alone(no friends, parents are not supportive) in my mental health struggles. So whenever i meet someone who is kind and nice to me, i open up almost immediately, even though i barely know that person and if i can trust him/her. I just can't control it. After such an interaction i always analyze everything i have said, how i looked, what they're gonna think of me and how they can use it against me. Then comes the feeling of crushing regret that is so strong i want to **live myself.

816,Anxiety about coworker coming back to work after recovering from covid,"I have bad health anxiety about covid. I‚Äôve had it twice now. Once in 2022 and I just had it again at the end of January. 2 weeks after I had it, my coworker got it and was out all last week. She came back today and said she tested negative but her husband still has it currently. She said she tested positive last Monday so it‚Äôs been 7 days and not 10 full days since infection when you are considered to be less infectious on day 10. But I know people can test negative sooner than day 10. When you test after an infection it‚Äôs supposed to be two tests 24 hours apart to confirm it‚Äôs gone and it wasn‚Äôt a false negative but I think my coworker only took one test this morning or yesterday. I obviously can‚Äôt tell her what to do but I am kinda scared being around her. I have no choice because we have desks at the front desk of a law firm and we don‚Äôt have a cubicle it is all open area but we are a good distance away not right on top of each other. 

I know I have some immunity from my recent infection but not sure how long that lasts. My coworker is not irresponsible either, she gets anxious like me and said she would‚Äôve worn a mask if she was still contagious but since she tested negative she isn‚Äôt wearing one and I am not wearing one either because we aren‚Äôt on top of each other but I am still worried in the back of my mind.

821,Am I supporting or enabling?,"My partner (F37) and I (M31) have been together for a couple of years now. She gets bouts of really bad anxiety, particularly around my working with other women (due to her past relationships and some lying I did at the start of our relationship which I take full responsibility for). I am freelance, so I move around a lot to different organisations. We've got into a pretty good rhythm when it comes to talking about her anxieties, but not always. Often she will get anxious and lash out in anger rather than sadness. 

&#x200B;

Currently I'm doing a traineeship and was asked to come to a training day. We quickly realised that, due to the nature of the traineeship, I would be the only male there. She asked me not to go, so I didn't - I called in sick. 

&#x200B;

This is one example of something I am struggling with as the partner of someone with anxiety - how do I know when I am supporting her or enabling her? In this example, I called in sick, but I don't feel good about it. I don't like lying and was taught to always put 100% in your work unless you physically or mentally can't (or your boss is a dick, but these guys are good). Sometimes I want to talk to her about anxieties to give her more information or make clear that I love her and only here, etc, because ultimately every job I turn down effects our household income. And when I accept a job that she is anxious about she wants constant texts and updates of what I'm doing, who I am talking to, so I can't just be present with the job. 

&#x200B;

I'm feeling very confused, so any guidance on this would be appreciated.

Thanks in advance."

828,Anxiety and work. I feel like a failure.,"Hey everyone. This is going to be a bit long winded. I realized that by making this post I have reached the point where I need to find a therapist. I have been struggling with severe anxiety and depression since I (25F) started college which was when I was 19. It started because I went to college away from home and was severely depressed and homesick. I transferred back home and the anxiety went away for about 2/3 years. When I got an internship in college (engineering degree) I was in a cubicle and absolutely hated it because i felt so alone and trapped in a cubicle 40 hrs a week which threw my anxiety over the roof. It was the worst my anxiety had ever gotten. 

Fast forward to graduation, I took a teaching job bc i was terrified of cubicle work and work in general so I thought I‚Äôd do something different. My anxiety came back and came in waves. It was a hard job and maybe not the best mix for someone who struggles with anxiety and depression. I stayed for a year and was emotionally done after that and stopped teaching. 

Here I am now. Anxious about the world and working and I think working in general is what gives me anxiety. 

I got a nanny job because I needed something more relaxed and laid back and a job that was part time. I nanny Mon/Tuesday as of right now. 

Not sure what it is but as soon Monday comes around I start to panic. Like i start overthinking my whole life. The whole drive here I was trying to control my thoughts and tell myself it‚Äôs ok to not have everything figured out. But I just can‚Äôt toughen up and realize this is life and it‚Äôs what everyone has to do. I think I‚Äôm also not comfortable with this family so it makes it hard. I don‚Äôt know what it is but when I‚Äôm here i truly feel the worst like it‚Äôs impossible to keep getting older and having to do life.

I feel like quitting every time I‚Äôm here even tho it‚Äôs only twice a week. I‚Äôve only been working for this family for 3~ weeks. 

I feel like a failure of an adult and I feel like I‚Äôm dragging my partner down with me because we can‚Äôt move forward with life if I don‚Äôt have a job. 

I just need advice. I feel like this anxiety will follow me everywhere and I‚Äôll never get a job and I‚Äôll always be stuck in this phase of life. "
829,I cannot stop overthinking and spiraling about the situation regarding my ex,"Can someone please help ground me about the situation surrounding my ex?

My ex and i broke up 4 weeks ago very suddenly because she felt the pressure of school was a lot and my unhealthy attachment and attitude and codependency plus her lack of proper communication drove a wedge between us and it effected her mental health. I was completely devastated but on the phone she told me we can meet in 2 weeks to talk. We both apologized and forgave each other but when I asked for a second chance she told me while she sees the possibility and will keep an open mind, 2 weeks is not enough time and she can‚Äôt give me a second chance right now. Because of her poor mental health, she relied too often on me as a crutch and the temptation to do that in a relationship is just too much so she told me she needs to learn how to put herself first, treat herself right, and be her own person. I cried but she said it‚Äôs ok we can text as friends for the mean time and we can hang out when we‚Äôre home again for spring break. Well flash forward 2 days later to Monday night. After texting those two days we talked that night and she was crying about hard it was and how she loves me and misses me and that it‚Äôs hard to text as friends cause it‚Äôs just very fake and it‚Äôs like a shell of what we were and a constant reminder. So I told her it‚Äôs all good whatever you need right now let‚Äôs just go no contact indefinitely. And she told me no and that I can text her when we‚Äôre home from spring break and we can talk again and hopefully she‚Äôs feeling better about the whole situation. This made me feel a lot better because I  was doing good all week, not waiting on a text, not even thinking about it and feeling like I was in a good position since she was still grieving the relationship and didn‚Äôt want to do indefinite no contact (I was stressed she hated me and completely forgot about the relationship so the fact she was upset about it made me feel better in a weird way). But then, last night, she‚Äôs posting on her spam Instagram a recap of the last two weeks and while she‚Äôs not even in most of them, she‚Äôs been hanging with friends and going out with them and stuff (although there were a few of her crying) and I feel like I lost all mental progress I made the last 2 weeks. I now feel like it was all lies and that she broke up with me because she wants freedom and that ‚Äúcollege experience‚Äù even tho she would tell me all the time she doesn‚Äôt want that and that mindset doesn‚Äôt even make sense. And the part about needing to learn how to put herself first and handle things on her own is definitely true because she would always talk about it with the therapist. But it‚Äôs hard for me to not overthink so then I also started to stress that when I see her again she‚Äôs just gonna not listen to a word I say and just turn around and say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm happier without you‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm better off without you‚Äù and just be so close minded to the whole situation. I feel like I‚Äôm just on an emotional roller coaster right now and it‚Äôs not fair because I feel like my mood switches about it every hour. She told me she still loves me and that I‚Äôm perfect and that she misses me. And she told me that she will keep the posts of us up on her insta and keep the photo album we have together. But then I just see her going out with friends and I feel like I was kinda just lied to about everything like are you really grieving or are you just trying to fill a void right now because I‚Äôm not there to talk to anymore. I don‚Äôt understand where she‚Äôs at emotionally and it‚Äôs been making me spiral. I‚Äôve been trying not to think about it but i feel like it kinda set me back again. And I know I shouldn‚Äôt think like that because I felt that way before seeing her in person for that first time again and clearly she did not feel that way so I have no basis here. "

833,Was it an anxiety attack?,"I have history of being anxious in normal occasions like trying something new. Never any attacks, I try my best to live a healthy lifestyle. I don't drink, or smoke; I exercise and try to eat healthy when possible. I am 21 M.

On Monday Jan 29 I woke up like any regular day at 8 am showered, ate a small breakfast and coffee. I started work which is just cutting chicken in a small room. I was training someone that day but I felt fine. I was relaxed and looking forward to hit the gym with my bros. 

 After finishing my lunch I started going back to work. My right hand and face started feeling numb, then my whole body. After trying to stay cool, I went home and felt like I was gonna die. I went to the ER and the doc told me it was a panic attack. The next day I lost my appetite for a whole week, I was 238 and dropped to 222 in weight. I went to 4 doctors, 1 told me I had food poisoning, 2 told me it was stress and anxiety, and another said an infection or covid. I started searching my symptoms which made my thinking worse. 
 During the first 2 weeks I had symptoms like frequent deja vu, eye strain, super vivid dreams, random body aches, weird heartbeats, and got new dents on my head.

  Yet I still feel like shit or somehow even worse, as of right now I have loss of sensation . I got cut I didn't even realize it and is not painful. Also cant feel my phone vibrating anymore small things like that. Nauseous when I eat, don't have my full appetite back, not feeling like my old self, random twitches, and sharp head pain. My muscles feel weak but I still have my strength. I can't even fart or shit like I used to, my stomach feels slow. Also feeling less aware about everything and less emotional.

Is about to be a month and I can't stand this anymore, I feel like im not living life . I just wish I can go back to that day wish it never happened. I lost motivation to go to the gym, work, and even play video games. I feel so afraid. I want my old life back.

836,Anxiety and urticaria/inflammation,"I'm 25yo and have been having random flare-ups of urticaria (hives, raised bumps and pressure urticaria) as well as pain and inflammation in my joints, collarbone and ribs (which often results in chest pain, which then makes me worry about my health and sometimes leads to panic attacks). I've also been dealing with anxiety and panic attacks for the last year or so.

I think the physical symptoms started first, about 2 years ago. But looking back, I was anxious and stressed out back then too - I just wasn't aware of it. I'm wondering if all these symptoms are related. I've had SO much bloodwork done, for everything including a full autoimmune profile, which came back negative for every autoimmune disorder they tested for. 

Has anyone else struggled with this? I'm so fed up with all these weird symptoms. There seems to be no clear physical cause and therefore no treatment. I keep going back to my GP for more and more tests and all of this stuff is just making me more anxious.

I just wanna be a normal people, follow the schedule, and control the life instead of being disorganized. 

Sometimes I doubt that I‚Äôm not suitable for living in this society and world.

846,Bad anxiety recently ,So recently I have been having terrible anxiety about something that happend along time ago in the past but its just on loop in my mind 24/7 for the past week. I smoke weed daily for about 2 years now it used to help but ever since my mind been on this everytime I smoke I just get really bad depressive thoughts and just wanna lay down and sleep and not wanna wake up what should I do
847,"Anxiety, Insomnia, Irritability ","My wife (40f) is going on a month of not being able to work because the anxiety and panic attacks are so bad.  She has horrible insomnia sleeping no more than 3 hrs a night and all broken up. She is on both klonipin at night for insomnia and Buspar during the day.  It appears to me that her medication is no longer working and her doctor is refusing to up her klonapin dose unless she does therapy. She is really mean and moody understandably so, unfortunately I (41F) am the one on the receiving end of it.

I am at a loss as to how to navigate these waters.  I am in therapy myself, but am not finding a correct way of establishing boundaries.  Everytime I set a boundary (no cursing or yelling at me or discussing divorce for the moment, just to name a few) somehow she does it more because she herself is in such a personal hell right now.

Has anyone been in this type of anxiety?  Her main issue is health anxiety.  Our house hold caught the flu as her anxiety was peaking and it's ended in 4 er visits 3 urgentcare visits and atleast 7 teledoc visits amd tomorrow we go to our GP.  

Last night her yelling was so vicious after I got home. I left the bedroom and slept in the living room.  Mind you I didn't say anything but ""I will not allow you to speak to me like this. I am walking away untill your ready to stop yelling."" I gathered my things as she told me we were getting divorced. That she would never forgive me for leaving our room, ect.

Any suggestions would be appreciated."
848,My experience with anxiety (possibly something else aswell) ,"Hello everyone, I would like to share my story of battling anxiety and would like to have some opinions of others. Throwaway account 

Just a quick recap of my background, i'm 28 years old male from EU. So sorry initially for some weird translations etc. Never had any bigger mental issues in my life, always been positive and happy in general. Last summer everything kind of changed, but for now I'm going in a really good direction where anxiety only affects my nights once a week. 

Last summer, I was watching television with my girlfriend, when a quite disturbing scene of a man stabbing a innocent person multiple times was shown. This scene for whatever reason painted this picture of me doing this to my girlfriend for just a few seconds, but it sent me into a huge panic attack. I couldn't stop thinking about it, I felt so disgusted and scared. I tried to stop my brain from thinking about it but you know what happens when you try to do that, it just makes it worse. I asked her if we could just go to sleep but obviously it took a long time before I fell asleep. 

The next morning everything seemed fine, I didn't think about the evening before. I went to work and suddenly everything hits me again, and I'm completely out of focus, heart is beating through my chest and eventhough it sounds quite silly maybe, all I could think of was that am I becoming a psychopath or a murderer. But at that time it didn't sound silly at all, I even contemplated whether or not I had to end my life to stop me from becoming something like that. 

This was constantly in the back of my mind for the next month. I avoided seeing my girlfriend, when we saw eachother I just wanted to watch some sitcoms etc. where my mind felt ""relaxed"". 

Throughout the months I kind of learned 2 things, I had to spend and force myself to be with my girlfriend as much as possible to not make it a habit and that letting myself accept that vision and understand that it is not going away would help. And it did, nowadays I have no problem being with my girlfriend, I don't get anxious around her and actually her company is what makes me relax and let's me get a better nights sleep. Also that vision has thankfully gone away a longer time ago already. 

The whole thing left some scars in to me, that is for sure. I don't get panic attacks anymore, but I still have anxiety attacks before going to bed etc. But like I said in the beginning, I'm in a much stronger position now then I was let's say 6 months back. 

My question for you guys if you managed to read this longer story, has something like this happened to you before? I haven't yet talked in detail what happened to me with my girlfriend, and I'm planning to. I just couldn't at that time force myself to explain everything to her. But I have promised to tell her everything that is going on with me and after 8 months I feel like I can talk about what happened without getting anxious. Would you tell your better half? "
849,Overthinking every interaction,"So,for the record,I Can t look people in the eyes because of my big weird eyes,and also I used to get a lot of people saying I m ugly and have ""weird facial expression"" .This makes me overthinking every interaction,and BESIDES my insecurity with looks,I m not a charismatic person,just really bland and weird energy,overthinking interactions even with old friends,and thinking in my head to make my voice more light and present in every moment of the interaction.What to do?

855,Having High BP the ither day is giving me anxiety again ,"Hi I'm feeling down right now. As 2 evenings ago my BP shot up to 140/90 after a stressful event.
Prior to that I ate a lot of salty and fatty foods.
I'm still 27 years old and only borderline overweight.
I got diagnosed with anxiety last september and. Along with it, I had a bloodwork.. everything was clear minus the slightly high uric acid.

Now because of that recent event I'm now stuck in a loop of checking my bp regularly. And I find it constantly elevated. When I woke up earlier this morning it was 130/93 during lunch it was 122/79 and now It's 128/83.

It's really making me anxious cuz I've been taking walks recently about 2-3 times a week and am shocked why would I get these readings... I'm really scared of being diagnosed with hypertension with such a young age...
Anyone have some tips or similar experiences?"

858,Anxious everyday because I messed up my relationship. ,"28F dated 25m. 7 month relationship. I traveled to him from CO to CA every two weeks. Paid for all my flights.
He only paid for food. When I came he only wanted to play his games and watch anime. I am not interested in that. Got close with his family. He ended it after I got angry that he texted some girl to cuddle who did not reply. I regret getting angry. I should have seriously chilled. When he noticed how angry I got. I also did tell his mom and I shouldn‚Äôt have done that and she yelled at him. I blew him up with texts calls and calls from different phone numbers. I even followed him from work then stopped following after a few minutes. Then he called me asked me to meet him at his house and he hit me and said *** you dumb b**** Anyways, I'm getting over him but I really thought he was the one. I literally worked so hard to afford seeing him. He wanted me to find a hobby while he played games but it's like.. dude I traveled all the way there to see you. He has now texted me that he thinks I'm the dumbest girl he has ever met. He said I will never be the girl he wants. He asked how I passed school. He lied to me and said he has a gf when he doesn't cuz his mom said he doesn't. He really hurt me.. I can't get over the fact I begged. I also posted our pics on insta after we broke up and his gamer friends saw and they just make fun of him. I feel bad for going crazy. With the spamming, and photos but how do I get over being so pathetic? I feel like I should be dead cuz l was a bother. ): I am not kidding my anxiety is so high every hour I cannot even focus. I‚Äôm unemployed right now maybe finding a job is a good idea but jeez I am not doing good at all. At all. "
859,As I‚Äôve gotten older I‚Äôve started to resent my poor childhood and my absent father.  ,"I‚Äôm 17 and my dad has basically been in and out of my life since I was 4 or 5. As early as I can remember he was just never around then would just randomly pop up for a little while just to disappear again. I still loved my dad though. He was my dad. Loving him was a no brainer to me at that point. I always thought that he and my mom just didn‚Äôt want to be around each other all the time. But even as a kid his absence caused issues. Whenever the topic of dads was brought up I was never in the conversation. Father‚Äôs Day was never a happy day for me. Any school event related to dad‚Äôs automatically excluded me. But I never realized the impact him not being around had on my siblings and family as a whole. My whole childhood until the age of around 15 my family has been struggling financially. We still struggle a lot now but not as bad as we used to. He never helped. He could never just do what he needed to do and find a good job to help support his wife and kids. He was always working low wage jobs like dishwashing or low wage office assistant jobs. Even then, none of his paychecks were seen by us. I, my siblings, and my mom all ate frozen tv dinners everyday because he could never contribute anything and my mom obviously couldn‚Äôt afford to raise 4 kids on her own as she wasn‚Äôt making much money either. We struggled so much. 


We never got the Disney trips or the nice family vacations over the summer. On the first day back to school I was always the kid who didn‚Äôt have shit to show the class about my summer break. 
We couldn‚Äôt afford to go to toys r us and buy the occasional toy or video game because we couldn‚Äôt afford it. Going to chick fil a was like a luxury to us because it was a break from tv dinners. I didn‚Äôt even know that shaqs were off brand shoes until kids in my class started making fun of me for wearing shoes from Walmart. While other kids were buying my favorite books at the book fair, I was buying erasers and posters because it‚Äôs all my mom could afford. The list goes on and on and gets worse the more I think about it. This fucker screwed us over so bad. He wasn‚Äôt there to teach me how to shave or even teach my how to be a man. Now I‚Äôm just picking up the pieces and I‚Äôm trying to learn all this shit on my own. 

Even now that I‚Äôm in my senior year my mom is paying for everything. My dad hasn‚Äôt contributed a fucking penny. My senior pictures, graduation fees, cap and gown, overdue club fees, graduation plaque and everything else all has to be paid for by my mom. All while she supports 3 other kids. My mom messaged him recently asking for help financially to get me through my senior year and to support his 3 other kids and all he told her was ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have any money‚Äù but apparently he had enough money to go on a vacation to another country over the summer. He could afford international travel and plane tickets but somehow has no money when it comes to his own kids. 

I‚Äôm just so fucking pissed off at him. I can‚Äôt even go to my dream school because it‚Äôs a private school and it‚Äôs too expensive for my mom to afford and I don‚Äôt want to go into massive amounts of debt. I can‚Äôt go anywhere on weekends or on breaks because my mom never feels like driving and is always so tired and drained from work that she doesn‚Äôt even want to leave the house. While 90% of my friends are getting their first cars and driving to school, I‚Äôm still hitching rides in my mom‚Äôs raggedy 2 decade old car. All because my fucking dad couldn‚Äôt do his goddamn job as a man with kids. 

Even now we‚Äôre still struggling everyday. My mom is always worried about bills, gas, groceries and other shit. We still can‚Äôt afford to go on vacation. The fucker passed down his flawed genes to me so now I suffer from mental illness. Everything is so fucked and im so pissed off. Not to mention my school is in the good part of our town so majority of the students at my school are in 2 parent households making at least 100k a year and you can tell just by how they parade around in their new expensive clothes and how they all have cars to drive anywhere they please and how they get to hang out with their friends without having to beg their exhausted mom to get out the fucking house. I‚Äôm so sick of this shit.  "
860,I'm terrified of having my wisdom teeth removed.,"Like it's not even anxious, it's like I'm unable to pay attention to anything type of terrified. To the point I will have constant heavy breathing, that level of terrified.

861,Why does my body have random bouts of twitching and mild pain?,"I was diagnosed with GAD about a year ago. It's gotten better, but also worse, and I had developed a habit of consuming ""zaza"" (as one might say), to the point where it became a crutch and I've given it up entirely.   


However, in these periods of remission I find myself experiencing random bouts of mild ""pain"" (more like a weird discomfort) and twitching in random places on my body. My chest has small areas that hurt, my fingers get warm, the side of my head twitches (not like my whole head moving, more like the muscles on the side of my head twitch), my stomach hurts in particular places, I'm fatigued and find myself getting hurt when exercising. I sometimes get terrible back pain that renders me borderline crippled but that's nothing to do with anxiety, but trying to strengthen myself to avoid throwing my back out or shoulders out is difficult due the the near constant state of minor discomfort.  


It's been like this for a while now and it's quite annoying to say the least, especially once you've quit using weed after abusing it for months and now the cold reality of your situation sets in, alongside the anxiety that pops up and gives you a quick heart palpitation before leaving sometime later. It really does suck the life out of me and I was wondering if any of you have tips to reduce these symptoms. "
862,Terrible anxiety,"Hi all. I get a lot of anxiety from groups, or rather from trying to fit into groups. I got too emotional on Fb the other day, and regret a lot of what I wrote. Terrible anxiety about this as it triggers memories of the bullying I endured when young. Like it never stops, you know?

I should probably avoid social media altogether but it is hard to stop."
863,I get these random thoughts about life that become overwhelming and scary,"I'm 20f and sometimes when I'm just laying in bed I start thinking and tonight as I was thinking about a flight in April for me and family to see my grandpa I had the scary thought of what if I die (I'm very scared of flying) but it turns into what even happens after and the thought of that's it and what if it's just darkness (I didn't grow up in a religious household besides mild mentions of heaven, hell, and God and as of rn I think my mom is catholic just doesn't really go to church and my dad doesn't believe in God more of a creator cause scientificly it doesn't make much sense and I kinda stand there as to me it doesn't make sense and I need logic to really help me understand)

What I'm asking is tho the thoughts of realization of only having this one life and i haven't lived yet and how I'm scared of dying one day as I don't know what happens after.. what is it? Is it some sort of anxiety?  This happens a bit when I start thinking too much. I just like realize we are here in this time all at the same time rn together but also thinking what is life and why am I here and what if it's not real and if I die I just wake up? It's scary. I hate it. 

Sorry I'm just trying to understand what this is and how I can maybe help not think about it cause when I do it destroys me but also the thoughts go away quick and then I forget all about it until the next time it happens."

I get to a point where it is all I can think about and my wife hates it. I think about how it is inevitable that the world will end one day.

866,Anxiety Episode or Something Wrong?,"M20
Metoprolol tartrate 25MG for blood pressure

Ill get straight to it, I've never really been diagnosed with anxiety, and I'm taking blood pressure meds due to possible hypertension. Ever since I started taking the meds I do feel like I have anxiety because ive been looking up all the symptoms and they seem to match. A couple of hours ago, i was playing on my PC with some friends. All of a sudden I got like a huge episode of nausea, lightheadedness, and just not feeling right like super shaky and anxious. My body had a flush feeling like the blood was leaving my arms and legs and I had to run in the kitchen and get a water and when I started drinking it I slowly felt better. I sorta also had a stinging/burning sensation in my chest near my heart. It wasn't what you say painful, but just sort of uncomfortable. Could this have been a random panic attack or anxiety episode? You don't have to give me official doctor advice, but please give me your personal opinion based on your experiences with anxiety if this could have been an episode of anxiety or possibly something else. I'm not feeling that way now and it only lasted about 2 minutes tops. I felt like I had to run or walk back and forth because of the weird feeling. I actually had another similar episode a couple of days ago that lasted around the same time and sipping water helped it as well. I actually checked my blood pressure last time it happened and it was very high almost if not hospital trip high. Could this all be because of anxiety? "

868,cant stop crying,"I feel like this is stupid but I really don't know what to do, lately I have a lot of anxiety thinking about if something were to happen to my mom. 

I dropped out this semester and began to depend much more on her since it is the only thing I have, because I distanced myself from everyone and I only like her company, since I was little it has only been her and me :(

 I have always had a difficult personality, in fact before I dropped out I had just entered uni and we argued a lot about money issues and when I left things became more controlled. I have always been sensitive to issues about mothers but now I really can't get it out of my head 

As I said, since I was a girl I have been very strong-willed, a couple of weeks ago we went to the movies and I had a very ugly argument with her, I wouldn't say it was the worst fight but it left a deep impression on me for some reason, maybe because I was never able to apologize well since I chickened out but I know she knows how I feel since I brought it up indirectly. 

The point is that I really feel a lot of anxiety and I haven't stopped crying all the time thinking that one day she won't be here and it terrifies me a lot. I've been like this for days and I don't know what to do. It's never happened to me."
869,Feeling sorta good but sorta meh,"For the entire month, I had the fear of dealing with a jury summons.

I hate that I did cause I feel the job would have been good for someone like me (winco cart clerk), but I was so stressed about everything. Nevertheless, no jury duty lol.

875,Have you guys tried that magnesium glycinate & vitamin D3 trick for treating anxiety?,"A bit of background: I haven‚Äôt been formally diagnosed with anxiety, but my doctor gave me a prescription for some sort of anxiety medication awhile ago because I had some problems catching my breath when I was under a lot of stress. Since then I‚Äôve been observing a lot of my cognitive processes and how I behave in certain situations and now I‚Äôm thinking maybe I do have anxiety.

So that brings me to my question. I saw on TikTok some people who have anxiety taking magnesium supplements and they say it works as effectively as prescription medication does. And the vitamin D3 is supposed to help with absorption of the magnesium or something like that. Have any of you tried this? Is it effective? Or is it placebo hogwash?

If it does work, what dosage should one be taking? I know that‚Äôs more of a question for my doctor, but my next appointment with my doctor is in over a month and I‚Äôm kind of curious now.

I was at the store today ready to buy some supplements to try it out but I wasn‚Äôt sure how much I should take and I was worried about taking too much because I don‚Äôt know if it could be harmful or not.

Thanks for any insight you can give me! I appreciate all the help I can get on this."

877,Feeling of food in throat for days after eating too much fries without chewing and drinking water,"It all happened after I eat too much fries and didn't really chew them, they were all soggy fries too. When I felt like the fries were stuck in my throat, I immediately drank so much water and cola to clear it, however, it still feels like it's stuck in my throat, feeling is still here as of today. I'm trying to cough it out and even make myself gag a lot for the first few days, no luck. Then I started to take antacids, still no luck. 



So I am feeling my throat being very tight, that Everytime I try to touch my throat, the feeling gets more powerful. I can still breathe and eat fine, but sometimes I struggle to swallow because I'm scared I might choke. This feeling never goes away no matter what, sometimes it just doesn't feel like it's there, but whenever I bend over, I feel something is in my throat, especially when I touch my throat. Should I see a doctor? How will they help me get rid of this sensation? It's not affecting me swallowing or breathing, but it's extremely terrifying

Edit: I also feel like my throat is burning from acid, but I don't think  something as simple as now chewing the fries enough a few days later can cause me to feel like hell. Now my mind is making me think that my body is releasing acid to ""digest the food stuck in throat"""

Anyone else experience this?"
881,Social Anxiety after an event,"Hey everyone, I‚Äôm sure these kinds of posts get made all the time but I wanted to hear from people who have similar experiences and if anything they do helps them. 
I‚Äôve had varying degrees of anxiety for a very long time. As i‚Äôve gotten older, it kinda of comes and goes at different times. This past year I‚Äôve been getting more anxious again following social situations- something I haven‚Äôt really felt in a long time. I feel like I have grown better in these situations to the point where I can feel comfortable and have a good time in the moment. But lately though, even if it feels like I had a great time- the moment I get home or the next day, I get very much in my head about anything I could have done or said to anyone that would come off as weird. It‚Äôs not like I even think certain things normally that I worry I‚Äôll say aloud, but more so I always worry something I may have said may have come off as rude, or perceived sarcastic etc when I was just trying to be friendly or social. I‚Äôm not entirely sure how to describe it, but I‚Äôm sure some people know what I‚Äôm talking about. The aftermath is very hard to deal with and I feel like the people I hung out with and had a good time with will actually resent me or something like that. It sometimes occupies a large portion of my day thinking about it. 
It is probably also worth mentioning that the majority of these situations there is drinking involved, either at a bar or something similar. It‚Äôs not drinking to a crazy extent or anything, but still enough to make me think it could play a factor. I know though, if I was not drinking then I would be less likely to go to some of these type of events though, which I am aware is probably a whole other problem in itself. If anyone has any tips on how they kind of deal with these ‚Äúpost-event‚Äù thoughts, that would be appreciated, or any other advice, thank you!"
882,Head falling back feeling,"For a couple years now I‚Äôve experienced this symptom of the feeling of my head falling back. The best way I can explain it is when you‚Äôre falling asleep (in class, work, etc.) and your drifting off, your head falls then you‚Äôre awake again. I get that exact feeling but my head isn‚Äôt moving at all. And I feel it in the back of my head

I posted about this on my tiktok a while ago and someone said they also experienced the same thing but through their eyes? I only get this feeling when I‚Äôm trying to sleep and my eyes are closed and my body isn‚Äôt moving.

I‚Äôve been dealing with this for years as mentioned, usually it goes away in a couple weeks but this time it really stuck. The first time it came up again, I had a HUGE anxiety attack over it. I do struggle with anxiety and depression if that could be a cause. I just don‚Äôt understand why this feeling happens or how to cure it. It‚Äôs making me loose sleep because it happens and send me into an anxiety attack or I‚Äôm so paranoid about it happening I‚Äôm constantly opening my eyes to avoid it. Usually it never works and I end up getting the feeling anyway. 

The very first time I experienced it I couldn‚Äôt sleep until 6 am due to the exhaustion of not getting sleep the entire night. That whole night was spent trying to tire myself out or distract myself from an anxiety attack. Every time the feeling would happen I‚Äôd wake up and get frustrated all over again. I‚Äôve cried many nights because this feeling just won‚Äôt go away.

It‚Äôs just so exhausting and frustrating dealing with the feeling and the paranoia behind it. If anyone has a similar experience, I‚Äôd like to know your input and any ways you‚Äôve tried to relieve this feeling. Thank you!"
883,"I'm an optimist, but also always feel anxious...","I think I'm very optimistic. My MBTI is ENFP. But I still feel a lot of anxiety when I hear that someone has achieved significant things, such as my boyfriend who has done exceptionally well on an exam that I haven't done well in before. In such a situation, I always felt that I had not worked hard enough to lead to such an outcome, and I felt very uncertain about the future. Will anyone else have the same situation?"

885,Panic attacks and having trouble telling reality apart.,"Hi! I'm 18 and recently I've noticed a pretty drastic change in myself for a while now. It all started when I was finishing highschool, it was a pretty difficult time in my life where I was barely sleeping, focusing on grades, and with an abusive ex while also having my driving lessons. So I didn't have much time to even breathe calmly for like, two months.

One night in january of this year, when I was about to go to sleep, I closed my eyes and had the worst feeling I've EVER felt, like I can't even begin to explain how disoriented and overall ""weird"" I felt. Like I was about to throw up, or that my head was going to explode, I was panting, out of breath, my vision was blurred, I literally thought I was having a heart attack, because I never had felt like that before in my life.

I didn't know what that was (still am not sure) and have told my parents about these ""episodes"" I keep having, but they tell me to breathe, and keep calm, and that getting scared in these situations make the feeling worse to me.

After the first time this happened, in january of this year, I've started to have more of these ""panic attacks"", like, I've recently started college, and before I started I could barely sleep, and kept thinking of it constantly, wich made me feel like I was about to ""explode into a million pieces"" again.

I bought a VR, and kept having trouble separating real life from virtual reality. I kept closing my eyes and when opening them back up being literally stuck inside the last game I was playing on VR. Like, shit was getting BAD.

I've noticed everytime I'm excited about something, that I'm anxious about something, or that I'm under some stress, I tend to think about stuff NONSTOP. It's so bad I can't even control my own thoughts. I've been having these ""panic attacks"" more and more often now, and they've been getting stronger, like in the last one, where I literally couldn't tell reality apart from my mind that was like still inside the VR, even though I was going to sleep.

I'm going to seek medical assistance with the help of my parents, because it's literally getting out of hand."
886,How often do you feel intense anxiety?,"Asking this because I feel like I‚Äôm an odd one out I basically get intense anxiety every day and I am crippled from it. Currently going through a bit of panic that‚Äôs lasted 2 hours I feel extremely dizzy and faint with palpitations I feel like I‚Äôll drop to the floor any second I have absolutely no reason to be anxious or anything.

887,Ice Packs help my physical anxiety symptoms,"I figured it out by accident but then looked into it more and I guess its like a mini version of cold therapy. Variety of reasons from simple distraction to others that are more scientific but better to google than have me misinterpret. 

What helps me is having a few of the medium size ones (5x10in ish) in the freezer. The blue ones that freeze solid, not the ones with beads or oats or whatever. Those dont stay cold long. I use one when resting or to sleep or am dealing with a panic attack. Put it on my side or wherever just avoiding skin contact. 

Also, the migrane ice packs that effectively cover your head. They‚Äôre some kind of stretchy gel mesh material. Can get on amazon. They stay cold maybe 40 min but putting one on my head clears up so many physical anxiety symptoms for a bit its a bit magic. 

Eye masks help a little as well but they dont stay cold long. The bead ones melt fast and the hot or cold option oat ones are barely cold. 

Anyway all can be found on Amazon and they arent too expensive and help me so maybe help someone else with their physical anxiety symptoms. Hope you are doing ok today all. "
888,Has anyone tried hypnotherapy?,"Hi, I tend to feel very socially anxious and I believe I started having negative thoughts about myself since I moved to a new school in 4th grade. I was bullied for being quiet and weird, despite trying to make friends. This really shot down my confidence and led to me withdrawing and trying to avoid bringing any attention to myself. I felt like a waste of space and feel scared of any possible threat. As an adult, I notice I still feel like I want to hide and shelter myself from social situations or being seen in public. I get overly anxious about going to the grocery store and things that seem easy to go do. I will think I don‚Äôt look good enough or come across as awkward. I really think I have beliefs about myself that stem from past experiences that I need to change. I‚Äôm wondering if hypnotherapy could help me re-program my beliefs about myself. Does anyone here have experience with hypnotherapy?"

890,Driving myself insane,"This is going to be quick and to the point, a bit crass as well. NSFW warning due to sexual subject matter. Also, I‚Äôm medicated, in therapy and my next appointment is coming up soon. 

I just moved in with my boyfriend and for some cruel reason my anxiety will not allow me to do the horizontal tango with him. My thoughts are constantly racing. It‚Äôs not like I don‚Äôt feel the urge because, believe me, as sure as the day is long and the sun is hot, I feel the urge. BUT, it‚Äôs accompanied by a tightness in my chest and butterflies in my stomach. The anxiety makes me I feel like I‚Äôm about to go cliff jumping without any safety gear.  Mind you this is not our first time being intimate with each other, we‚Äôre nowhere near pious virgins. Yet we‚Äôve been living together for an entire month and have only had sex once. 

I don‚Äôt even know how to explain it to him when he asks me why I won‚Äôt have sex with him. How do I say, ‚ÄúI love you to bits and pieces, would love for you to $!;/$&@; me and I wanna $@:&? you while we ‚Äú?($;@&$! .. but my irrational thoughts won‚Äôt let me‚Äù in a way that doesn‚Äôt sound radioactive to a man in his mid twenties with a healthy sexual appetite. 

Sorry for the long post, just needed to vent.

893,Anxious rant about work and coworkers,"TL;DR- An ex-coworker had told me that my other coworkers talk shit about me behind my back and now I cant get it out of my head.

About a month ago, i started working morning shifts and got ro know one coworker better- Mikey we'll call him... We talked sometimes about mundane shit, ya know. He complained a lot about our other coworkers, specifically the girl who invites me out to the club, who i have a fun time with- Pam we'll call her...

I dont speak spanish, but all of my coworkers do. I *should* speak spanish, as all of my aunts and uncles do, but my dad spent a lot of time away from home growing up (mom is half german). So its a lot of internal turmoil for me. I'm doing my best to learn, but it doesnt happen overnight, and as I was just ranting to my dad about it, he literally said ""youre really smart, you can learn spanish"" and suggested i take classes. To be fair, I dont think he'd be a great teacher at this point.

Mikey tells me that Pam and another coworker who is BOH (i work in food) talk shit about me behind me back. He blatantly said so. a convo we had went like (paraphrasing a little bit):

M- ""i hate it here blah blah blah (points to the kitchen where coworkers are chatting and laughing) they are all bad people.

they talk shit about everything...they talk about you too!""

me- (i had tried saying that i dont care if people talk shit or whatever, that we work in a tight space, that people rant and its not the same; so i was trying to get him to shut up) ""oh and what do they say?"" (like in a challenging type way)

M- ""like R, she said that you are lazy.""

i bluffed and was like, ""I dont care. if it was a problem she'd tell me."" (and she does all the time, and now we have a better working relationship since we work together more no)

I told him after the fact that I didnt appreciate it, and that I dont want him to tell me if other people say bad things about me behind my back. And then he said sorry, that he didnt want to make me upset.

So that day, i think there was also just work stressing me out.. so i just wanted to leave when i was off before i had a panic attack. So as I'm leaving, Mikey is like ""oh i set your tips in the back"" (its like 1$ usually). and i replied ""oh no, thats ok (gesture)"" and he goes, ""well you dont have to be rude about it."" and I forced a smile and said oh i wasnt trying to be rude, i just really want to go home right now.""

Next day comes along and he communicated to me that when i told him yesterday that his words made me upset, he said ""that really pissed me off."" and that he was ""just trying to help.""

I have had toxic job after toxic job for the last 4 years. I had to stop working for like 5ish months cause i had an absolute breakdown, two years ago now and im still crawling out of that pit. Ive really loves working here so far. i have made friends!!! I have people who ive only known for less than 6 months who invite me out to have fun, when people ive known since middle school- and who live 5 minutes away for our whole lives- never do. ever. Unless there is something wrong. So ive been really happy. And then he took that and smashed it into a million pieces and i feel like Im right back into that toxic work environment where no one is on my side, where i am bullied, where i am seen as a joke, or a bitch, or something.

None of the evidence points to my other coworkers seeing me as a joke and whatnot. And i *always* look at the evidence, since cognitive distortion is real. And I know that they probably do like me and arent making fun of me or whatever...

but idk. I d k. and now i cant get it out of my head. I wish he had never said those things to me, it absolutely fucking ruins my day if i even think about it. 

So now, whenever i mess up, or dont understand the convo, its just at the back of my head.. 

side note: i do know enough spanish where i can usually tell if someone is talking shit. And im the type where you can tease me to my face, ill joke along. but i never know what happens behind my back, or what is untranslated...

but ya. if you made it this far, üëèüèΩüëèüèΩüëèüèΩ

if you have any similar experiences, id love to hear how you got through it..."

898,Can't stop googling about blood in urine ,"I recently turned 24 and over the past couple of months suffered through blood in urine. It has always came in relation with my period. First time it came directly after, lasted a couple of weeks, and the trend kept going on until I was given antibiotics. Since then its the opposite: a few days before my period I go through 1-2 days of dark orange - red in urine, then it disappears until the next period. So it happens less frequently for sure, but still there‚Ä¶I have no pain or symptoms except peeing more sometimes, but I think thats more due to my anxiety. 

You know how it is with anxiety‚Ä¶I went back to back to urgent care and even a urologist. Nothing found. None were worried‚Ä¶next week I have an appointment with my regular gyno to see what she says. 

Of course I made it worse by googling. Endometriosis I thought. Read it can only be certainly diagnosed with surgery. Absolutely terrified of it. Got really deep into it where I just couldn‚Äôt stop googling and being more anxious. Then I started reading on cystoscope. People say when you‚Äôre young they usually dont do it yet I landed on all these bladder forms and subreddits where everyone had one. Absolutely terrified of it. I searched and searched for one post, one answer that could satisfy me but the cycle never stops. I feel like I cant even enjoy the present moment, because im like ""well I will likely need some type of surgery"" and im worried about that 24/7 even though my appointment is in a week! And it doesn‚Äôt help that my symptoms are isolated, the doctors suspected bladder inflammation but every google result with people that had this they had a bunch of other symptoms and antibiotics seem to have taken it completely away‚Ä¶.

He referred me to a hematologist and my appointment is in a few days, and I have had so many panic attacks about this. I know that an elevated WBC count can be from a lot of things but it‚Äôs like my mind is locked onto it being some form of blood cancer. ü•≤ I‚Äôm honestly just not sure what to expect at this appointment and that‚Äôs giving me insane anxiety. üôÉ"
903,"My anxiety nausea is taking a toll on my physical health, vent/advice appreciated ","I am not an anxious person by the standard definition of the word. I was very introverted and quiet in high school, but since then I‚Äôve really come out of my shell and morphed into a person that I am very happy to be. I wear elaborate, expressive outfits that bring me  attention, I am very outgoing and I don‚Äôt suffer from social anxiety at all. I‚Äôll happily make a fool of myself in public to make people laugh, I‚Äôll engage in open conversation with any stranger, and I love trying new things. 

But something is massively wrong with my body. I used to feel nervous in high school, the normal amount, jittery or sweaty when I was about to give a presentation or talk to my crush. But it‚Äôs been years since I‚Äôve felt a ‚Äònormal‚Äô amount of anxiety, and it‚Äôs hard to even recall what it feels like now, but I wish I fucking could- I‚Äôd give anything to go back to being frequently nervous, but at a normal level. I don‚Äôt feel anxious like that anymore, I‚Äôm almost always relaxed and confident, but now, on rare occasions, I will feel anxious, and it‚Äôs boosted up at 1000%. It‚Äôs not the butterflies or the increased heart rate anymore, it‚Äôs a full on rush of intense nausea- I feel sick to my stomach, and I often need to throw up everything I‚Äôve eaten. When this happens, I usually can‚Äôt eat again for at least 12 hours, except for a few forceful saltines to keep myself from the hunger pains.

I will be doing just fine, enjoying my life and being confident and happy, when suddenly something will trigger it, and I become an absolute mess. I can‚Äôt sleep because I feel too sick, I can‚Äôt eat, even sipping water is difficult as it threatens to force its way back up. It tanks my productivity, because I feel like I can‚Äôt even move- every motion brings the risk of throwing up everything I‚Äôve worked so hard to keep in my body. Sometimes the nausea lasts for days on end, I can‚Äôt go to my classes, and I struggle to get through a day at work. I‚Äôve tried all kinds of nausea medications and treatments- pressure point bands for my wrists, multiple different chewable nausea tablets, aromatherapy, breathing exercises, grounding exercises, I even went to a doctor- she prescribed me Zofran, and it helped a bit, but they charged me a lot for the appointment just to get the prescription, and she prescribed me 30 but the pharmacy claimed they could only give me 8- I don‚Äôt have the money to just keep doing back to ask for more prescriptions just for 8 fucking tablets. 

I haven‚Äôt figured out what triggers it either, so it‚Äôs hard to stay away from whatever it is. It is so random, and shows up at the strangest times- often, when there‚Äôs not even anything recognizable that would stress me out at all. Sometimes I go through situations that would normally be overwhelmingly stressful to someone else, but I dance through with flying colours. But sometimes, I‚Äôm getting ready for a fun night out with friends- close friends that I trust and feel safe around, going to a place where I know i will have fun and enjoy myself- and the nausea kicks in full force. I can tell that part of my triggers must be related to relationship trauma though, or the threat of a deep emotional connection with someone, because every time I realize I truly care about someone in a romantic sense, I lose the ability to eat or sleep or work, I find myself vomiting violently whenever I even think about that person, and I am just absolutely overcome with nausea until I either break off the forming relationship or I power through long enough that it goes away (has taken almost a month before.) I am not afraid of relationships, commitment, or having my heart broken, but it‚Äôs something in my body that must be, and refuses to listen to reason when I reiterate all the reasons I am safe in a situation, or all the reasons why what I‚Äôm doing is okay- it doesn‚Äôt matter. The nausea persists. The fact that it is so difficult for me to get into relationships because of this has sparked a deep worry within me that I am, in some way, unlovable or more difficult to love than I should be. Falling in love is supposed to be magical and beautiful and comfortable. Instead, for me, it‚Äôs painful and horrible, it wretches my guts into painful knots and leaves me curled up in front of a toilet wondering what I did to deserve living like this. 

That‚Äôs another part of it- it feels so difficult to live with such random and debilitating anxiety-induced nausea. It‚Äôs so horrible that sometimes, when I‚Äôm alone and clutching at my stomach, I catch myself wondering if I‚Äôd be better off dead than living in such deep discomfort. I want to clarify though, I love my life, I am not a danger to myself, and these are just thoughts that I find whispering in the back of my head- it just saddens me that they‚Äôre there at all. I love my life, and for most of it, I feel great, I‚Äôm in good health and I‚Äôm having a good time. But upon the rare occasion, I find myself absolutely unable to function, and it‚Äôs absolutely debilitating and exhausting.

Anyways, I just needed to write that all out somewhere. I‚Äôm working with a therapist at the moment to see what could be causing it, or what I could do to make it better, but for the time being it‚Äôs still pretty bad. I have lots of college work to catch up on, and many deadlines approaching, but I can‚Äôt even seem to get started on any of it today, as I‚Äôve just been keeled over for hours. I‚Äôm not too stressed about the deadlines either, so it‚Äôs not that. I just don‚Äôt understand why my body insists upon reacting so violently at the most random times, and over such insignificant things. I truly wish I could explain to my body that it‚Äôs okay- I‚Äôm safe, I‚Äôm secure, there‚Äôs no reason to be anxious- but my body has just decided that it‚Äôs one of those days, I guess.

I don‚Äôt know if any of you deal with anything similar, but if anyone has any advice, or even just support, it‚Äôd mean the world. If you read this all, thank you so much. I hope you have a wonderful day, and that you are able to tackle whatever issues you are going through too. "

905,The Horror of the Shade,"Paralyzed.

It's happening all over again. I'd thought it defeated, but it came clawing back from the pit I had cast it into. It strikes with the same vitriol, digging its rancid talons into my flesh. It laughs at me. I should've seen it coming. I didn't.  


It started with stomach pain. Not an unfamiliar friend. I've got fibromyalgia, so pain's as natural to me as breathing. It evolved. Unending growling, even worse still. Until I found blood one day. And I felt the shade's breath upon my spine, cold as winter. I went to Urgent Care. I went to the Emergency Room thereafter. I'd been seen prior for the pain, yet it was - as it always is - dismissed as frivolous, temporary. Surely, my doctor must've thought, I'd be well in a day or two.  


Except now they're concerned. I can see the doctor's notes on MyChart. My bloodwork was reassuring, yet they all seem convinced I'm very ill. So here I am again, except this time, my foe is all too real. I don't know what stands against me, yet I can't help but to feel it's worst. That this shadowy apparition, the shade, had finally won. The world feels dim now. The path icy and cold. I can feel myself failing. I don't eat anymore.

The horizon is distant. The lights ever so few. Gone is my mother's reassurances, who, like my doctors, seems less confident I'm well. I just wanted peace, love and comfort. All of it's been taken. All I have is my will. And with every appointment, I feel it slowly wane. I can't help but to wonder whether I'll be joining it in the abyssal nil. "

I said, ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt expecting everyone here. I was expecting my BIL and his family. I wasn‚Äôt expecting others. I cannot just deal with this changing situation.‚Äù 

I‚Äôm just trapped. I can‚Äôt go anywhere. I want to just scream. I‚Äôm in the bathroom crying. I love my wife and whatnot, but I‚Äôm just really fucking overwhelmed. All of my safe spaces are occupied and I‚Äôm being expected to be available. I just don‚Äôt want to be. I just want to go downstairs and play video games because I am that overwhelmed. 

Group therapy sure is gonna be a fun time tomorrow. "

910,Heart Anxiety Despite Being Checked Out,"I've been dealing with chest pain lately. Most of the time they're random, and they can occur all over, but I've been to the hospital twice now in 3 months. I've gotten multiple x rays and ekgs, even had bloodwork done. My chiro thinks I may have costo. Not to mention I had a stress test done about 4 years ago so... I should be good right?

913,Hopefully some inspiration ,"After about a year and a half, I finally forced myself to the gym and did 30min on the treadmill. 

I have GAD with panic attacks. I promise I‚Äôm just as bad as anyone here. I‚Äôm also a recovering alcoholic (5 years sober). I have severe health anxiety, well, heart anxiety anyway. 

By the grace of my God who I call Jesus Christ, I haven‚Äôt had a panic attack in 2024 yet. In fact I‚Äôve only have had to take .375mg of clonezepam in 2024. This is coming from a person who in the height of their alcoholism was taking about 12mg a week / 48mg a month!  

I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs happened or what has changed other than really just picking up some tips here and there on this sub, but other than that, I‚Äôve changed nothing. 

Today is a beautiful day in my city in the Midwest. House is clean. I‚Äôm all caught up on everything and knew I that I could not sit around all day and do nothing again on my day off ( single, all my friends are dead from alcohol, drugs, shootings ). I have no social life anymore and no excuses.  I forced myself to the gym

It wasn‚Äôt full on cardio, but my heart rate was definitely elevated for a good 15min of the 30min. I did have a brief moment of panic toward the end of the heaviest part when I felt pressure in my chest, which just ended up being gas. I even sweat a little. 

I wouldn‚Äôt say right now that I feel
 A-MAZING, but I do feel good and am grateful that I made it out in one piece. More so than facing my fear of an elevated heart rate, I‚Äôm just proud of myself for getting off the couch, getting dressed and going to actually do it. 

I know it‚Äôs hard. I know it‚Äôs terrifying because I‚Äôve been there so many times, but if you seee this, go for a walk around the block or to the gym. Even for 20min. No one is coming to save us. We have to save ourselves. It‚Äôs the only way. God bless "
914,Starving,"This has been going on for around seven years I wanna say, so a year before my diagnosis. But I physically can't go get something to eat in my own home anymore if someone is out there. It doesn't matter who it is, or what they are doing, it just feels like I can't do so.   
Like I feel like they are going to say something about what I eat, or how much of a serving I get if they see me getting something. Which they sometimes have, but nothing particularly malice.   
So with this, I have gone several days to hours just not eating anything, or unless imprompted to by someone else in the vicinity. And this has just been getting more and more annoying, especially with 14 people in my home. So it just becomes more and more frequent. "
915,Does anxiety cause excessive urination? ,"As the title states I've been dealing with some excessive urination, mostly during the late hours, it hasn't woken me up once but it's very noticeable, it's been like 6 times the past 5 hours and I'm not sure if it's caused by anxiety or not. Healthy anxiety is my major problem, so when I'm urinating excessively it's absolutely worrying me and I'm not sure if it's just anxiety. I'm constantly worried about things like diabetes although I'm trying my best to prevent it, drinking water and doing some amount of exercise even if it's not too terribly much. My grandma has diabetes so I'm worried about developing it I'm only 22 but I know age doesn't exactly matter for diabetes. I may be just worrying myself too much, I don't go much throughout the day, maybe 2-3, night time is when I usually drink the most water anyway, but 6 times is excessive I feel. I also worry too much about forms of infections, of as it goes with hypochondria, cancers. 

Am I just blowing things out of proportion? I do drink a lot of water and my urine is almost never dark because of that, I have maybe had 5 cups max over the course of the night, it is full of ice so it's not like it's 16oz every time. I'm asking and just hoping anxiety cause I can't afford to visit a doctor. "

"
918,Sudden Anxiety Attacks in My Mid-Thirties,"I guess this is mainly asking to see if anyone out here has been in a similar situation before, and if they have any advice that has worked for them.

I'm male, recently turned thirty-five, living in the UK. I've never really had any anxiety problems before - I think the only I can think of is when I was eight or nine and for a few months I'd have really bad separation anxiety whenever my parents would leave me by myself.

However, about four weeks ago I had I think my first ever anxiety attack, and then last night I had another one, and these are probably some of the most unpleasant feelings I've ever had.

The first attack came on on a Monday evening and was just this overwhelming feeling that I might die at any moment. My partner is incredibly supportive and did all she could, but it was a difficult one to power through. It felt like every five minutes or so I'd feel something slightly 'wrong' somewhere in my body, and my brain would spiral into thinking that this is a sign of my death, or just a sign of my general mortality. I stayed up and tried to distract myself, which worked for a little bit, but when I went to bed I tried to relax and that triggered a full panic attack, where I was trembling and just completely overwhelmed.

After that I convinced my partner - bless her - to go for a walk with me around the neighbourhood at 3am! Being outside and walking stifled the anxiety and made it kind of manageable, but once we got back it was still very much there. At that point though after talking through it with my partner I was able to convince myself more and more that I probably wasn't going to die, that this was just anxiety, and externalising the problem helped some. Eventually I managed to fall asleep while, ironically, stroking \*her\* hair, rather than being cuddled or massaged myself, somehow that gave me enough distraction from the feeling.

The following day when I woke up it was still there, I went to work, which kept me distracted from it, then when I got back home I immediately had a nap and once I woke up - like magic all the anxiety was gone. It was such a relief! In all, it lasted about 24 hours.

Since then though, I've ironically felt occasionally scared and a little anxious now and then of having another anxiety attack like that - and last night, I realised I was having another one.

What's odd is that, being better prepared going into my second one, it felt so much more like a physical condition than a mental/emotional one. During my first one the main physical symptoms I noticed was my hands and feet going very cold (normally I am very warm in my extremities) and I started having a churning stomach and diarrhoea a good hour or two before I actually started getting the anxiety itself.

I started getting spirally thoughts about death and mortality, but this time was able to fairly quickly externalise it, and decided to just stay up and distract myself until I got tired enough that I'd be able to fall asleep easier. And it was very much this recurrent thing of just, every five minutes getting this swell of anxiety come up from my stomach. Totally not related to any thoughts I was having. I was able to acknowledge fully that I was fine and not in any danger and that I wouldn't be feeling like this if not for the anxiety attack - but it's so frustrating not being able to do anything about it? Also really frustrating that it came after actually a really nice day out with a long walk in the sun. Ate healthy, got my steps in, everything about right. The only thing I can think of that maybe triggered it is caffeine?

When I went to bed, I was able to fall asleep fairly quickly - it was half two and I was tired - but then I had weird cyclical thoughts when I'd wake up intermittently in the night, like I was having a fever dream. Woke up in the morning absolutely soaked in sweat!

Today I've mostly been out for a walk as well and keeping myself distracted, and I guess I'm keeping it 'managed' well enough, but god it's exhausting. It's overall less intense than the first one I had, and I'm being able to externalise it better and keep myself from spiralling - but it still really sucks and I can't wait for it to pass. I'm *really* hoping this one doesn't last much longer than 24 hours and goes away by tomorrow.

If you've read this far, thank you for reading through this! That means a lot to me. I'm going to try and talk to a therapist about it this coming week, but I wanted to check with folks here and see if anyone else has been in a similar situation, and if anything in particular has helped them?

&#x200B;

* Have you had anxiety attacks out of nowhere that last 24h or so before clearing up? Were you able to find what triggered them?
* A lot of anxiety advice tends to be about regulating your thoughts, like CBT, but I'm finding even when I do that the anxiety is still there, it feels like a very physical state, like an upset stomach. Any advice for preventing these attacks, or stopping them early? I'm finding a lot of things like exercise and being outside and distracting myself help mitigate the feeling, but it always comes back when I stop doing that thing."
919,Serotonin Syndrome? ,"Recently got diagnosed with pretty severe GAD and insomnia. My psychiatrist prescribed me 50mg Sertraline, 100mg Trazadone, 25mg Seroquel, 20mg Propanolol, and 30mg Buspar.

I take the Sertraline and 15mg Buspar in the morning, and Propanolol + 15mg Buspar a few hours before the Trazadone and Seroquel for bed. I‚Äôve noticed that my anxiety has been getting worse, bordering on debilitating, and I think it‚Äôs the medication. More specifically, taking too much of it. 

I‚Äôm wondering if the combination of all the serotonin inhibitors are giving me onset serotonin syndrome. I read you shouldn‚Äôt combine Buspar and Trazadone. If I had to pick one to go I‚Äôd like to get off the Buspar safely. I‚Äôm becoming more anxious, restless, can‚Äôt stop pacing, hard for me to settle down and focus on anything. No appetite, completely depressed. Feel like jumping out of my skin. I took a lorezapan today and it was the most relief I‚Äôve felt in weeks. I felt normal again. 

I‚Äôm going to see a specialist this week but was curious if anyone has been in the same boat. My old psychiatrist admitted she was out of her depth when prescribing all these meds. She was throwing spaghetti at the wall to see what sticks. "
920,need advice/support regarding cleaning/organizing. anything will be appreciated,"Hey all

I'm a 35 year old dude with OCD, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and Depression

I live in a tiny apartment with not a lot of space, and my messy-ness is a little bit out of control.

Ok... it's honestly not THAT bad. But there's a lot that's just kinda all over the place that I wish I could split up between ""pack this stuff away"" and ""put this stuff on display,"" and keep the stuff on display at a minimum because it's challenging to fully dust when there's a ton of figures out on display. 

Not only that but there's also stuff that's kinda spilled out onto a table in the living room which can be a bit embarrassing.

A few years ago, I actually successfully started reorganizing everything. Something had happened in my personal life that gave me a lot of motivation and I made a considerable amount of progress. I went out and bought a small bookshelf for books and games, and I started packing away things I knew wouldn't end up on display.

By ""packing away,"" I mean splitting them between open drawers in a dresser and big plastic boxes (the kind with the lid that snaps onto the top to close it). And more specifically... wrapping almost all of it in bubble-wrap. During the last move, some stuff got scratched here and there, so I guess I'm a little paranoid about packing away anything remotely ""point-y"" without some kind of protective casing.

I also have a bunch of plushies which I just kinda jammed into two other plastic boxes. Interspersed in the plushies are... dryer sheets. Like.. static softener sheets. I honestly don't know why those are in there.

Probably because, and this is the biggest issue

I'm very very worried about bugs.

I'm 99% sure I have a carpet beetle problem. Like, very sure that's what they are, and they were way worse in my previous living arrangement. 

They're NOWHERE near as bad now. Long ago I had to throw out a guitar gig bag because it was full of larva shells or whatever. Nowadays I find a larva here or there. 

But while doing all my organizing back when I had motivation, I did find one inside a used toy I had bought from a retro toy shop, so that... who knows where that came from.

Funny enough I also recently got something I ordered straight from Japan, and inside the plastic in the box it came in... were two of those shells. I guess I just attract these things to myself?

So that might be why there's dryer sheets mixed in with the plushies, but basically my biggest, biggest fear is that I might pack away a whole bunch of things into a box that unknowingly have a bunch of carpet beetle larvae in them. And then.. I dunno what would happen. Would they damage my stuff? Would they reproduce and make a little carpet beetle colony in my box? 

Orrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
am I just being very anxiety-y about all of this and odds are nothing major will happen? 

It's totally possible that I'm overthinking literally all of this. I can imagine people less anxious than myself, if they were in my exact living situation, might just box up stuff without any bubble-wrap or dryer sheets and not think twice about it. Maybe that's the way to go. 

I dunno.

I really wanna get stuff packed away ASAP, before I lose this shot of motivation I have this week, so any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for reading all of this."
921,Exhausted after Stressful Situations?,"Hello everyone,

I have been battling anxiety and depression for awhile now. I get anxious for everything and nothing at all. After, a stressful situation like an exam at university, it takes me a couple of days to bounce back to my normal self. I can't be very productive or get much work done. I take the time to focus on myself. 

No matter how big the situation is, after the initial stressful situation (ie. exam) I just don't seem to care. Almost, like I stressed myself to the max and I feel exhausted. I sleep a lot during this period.

Does this happen to you? Is this normal?

Thank you so much!"
922,Should I be worried about rabies?,"I was on a walk today at my old elementary school. I‚Äôve been taking walks there for years now.

For the first time ever, I saw a dog walking around on its own in the parking lot. I live in Connecticut and given that‚Äôs its February, it was absolutely freezing this morning. About 10 degrees Fahrenheit.

So I immediately thought it was strange that this cute little dog was wandering about all by itself in freezing weather. Sometimes the dog would walk toward me, sometimes it would wander off in some other direction. But I kept a close eye on it because it seemed strange that it was all alone on a freezing Sunday morning with no one around.

I kept looking around so check where its owner was but there was no one in sight. Upon closer inspection, I could see the dog was shivering and I started to feel very bad. I walked back to my car and he followed me. At that point, I picked him up and put him in the front seat of my car to warm him up, then proceeded to call animal control.

While we were waiting for them to arrive, I took my gloves off and began to pet him. At no point did the dog bite or scratch me. And his behavior seemed to be normal: No abnormal levels of aggression of affection, no sudden movements, no drooling. He also had an invisible fence collar on and a leash collar, but no collar identifying his name or who he belonged to.

Regardless, I began to feel very anxious (I‚Äôm a naturally anxious person) that perhaps I shouldn‚Äôt have been petting this dog that is completely unfamiliar to me.  

I expressed my concerns to animal control and they told me not to worry given that I wasn‚Äôt bitten or scratched, and also that all dogs need to be vaccinated for rabies. And it‚Äôs been years since any rabies cases concerning dogs were called in.

Still I can‚Äôt help but worry. Am I being ridiculous? What can I do to put my mind at ease? It‚Äôs Sunday so I can‚Äôt call animal control to ask about whether or not they‚Äôve been able to discover any info about this dog‚Äôs vaccination history."
923,Anxiety going away? ,"Has anyone had anxiety and then all of a sudden gone years without having any symptoms?

Is this a cop out for the doctors or is this true. This whole thing started from a numbness attack that I had Tuesday.

927,I‚Äôve been struggling a lot with anxiety & panic attacks here‚Äôs my tips.,"Anxiety is pretty genetic in my family. My dad had his first panic attack a decade ago and has had it since. I‚Äôve had my first panic attack at a hospital visit and have had to since. Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve done to coupe and what has helped me keep it away. This is what I‚Äôve learned over the last 6 months.

1. Okay you‚Äôre eating out and it hits you: Take a deep breath, make sure your breathing is slow, or you will panic. Take a step outside and admire the nature around you whether its the sky or area around you. Find something peaceful that can‚Äôt leave you, and can‚Äôt change. It will help ground you, just removing yourself from that place will help you, because your mind will taint it immediately with bad. Keeping earbuds on hand to block out thoughts with music or soothing sounds has also helped in some cases. If you can write down your thoughts in public, do it.

2. Okay you‚Äôre home or at work and it hits you out of the blue: the sound of rain or wind playlists from Spotify help calm me but not always. Distractions like social media also help, but not always. What always helped me is going for a walk outside and getting fresh air. I also recently discovered writing down ALL thoughts during panic attacks or times of anxiety that feel like impending doom have helped clear my head completely by organizing these thoughts and analyzing them. Just writing them down takes the sense of doom away for me.

I wish you the best, and you will improve and life will be perfect. You got this."
928,Making a safe space in my room and need suggestions on items for it!,"
I‚Äôm currently putting together a safe space for myself when I‚Äôm feeling overwhelmed, stressed, and overall when I need to be more relaxed and calm. I think this will help me significantly. I‚Äôm already planning on adding more plants and some wall art. Probably some lighting as well. 

What items have helped those of you with anxiety (or bipolar, I have both) that you think would be beneficial to put in this space? I‚Äôm open to hearing decor items but mostly looking for items that would help me during times of distress. Any specific fidget toys I should add to the side table? You can see my current set-up on my profile. I posted this same post in the bipolar sub as well. I‚Äôve got some sketchbooks and coloring tools plus some other random nick-nacks to help.

I thought it was just my hormones, but this has been going on for months.

930,Really bad dejavu makes me nauseous also getting flashes of fake memories,"i didnt really know where to even post this but ive decided to post here, because it's really scary at times and it makes me crazy. i also saw somewhere that there might be a link between dejavu and anxiety, i think this sub is my best chance.
some days i have really, really bad dejavu, it makes me really nauseous and ive never met anyone else that has the same feeling. even while writing this its making me feel really weird. on these days i often get flashes of ""memories"" i think im remembering some dreams ive forgotten or something, but it makes it rlly confusing during my day, ill suddenly remember a part of this ""dream"" but it feels like its reality, even now im getting flashes of ""memories"" idek how to describe them. it freaks me out so much and i want to know if anyone else has experienced this. 

its really really vaugue, it doesn't make any sense in my head, i start to question which things are real at times. 
the dejavu part can last for a while or just a second, sometimes i have dejavu of having dejavu, if that makes any sense at all. 

one thing i do know tho is that it often happens when im not having the best day or i slept late and therefore im really tired the dat of my dejavu. 

those ""other memories"" at times feel like im living two lives, and getting flashes of my other life back, im hoping i can find someone who has the same, i've tried looking online but i dont even know how to describe my symptoms üò≠ 

it's usually over after a day, but it does last the whole day. 
i know there is probably a good reasoning behind it, lack of sleep and stuff, but its still really scary.

its hard for me to make this post make sense and for that km sorry, im just typing out my thoughts at the moment. im still experiencing memories of what i think are forgotten dreams in my minds. 

im hoping someone out there can relate to me and/or give me some tips about how to handle it.

i just sot through these days, i feel horrible and the next day im fine again. but i dont want to feel like this for a whole day. 

feel free to ask any questions if anything didn't make sense or want to know more!"

933,Anxiety bad trips/highs psychosis?,"Whats up I just have a couple questions I have had a couple of bad trips lately, keep in mind I have OCD.

So about 6 months ago I went to go see a grateful dead coverband on 3 grams of PE shrooms.  I had only microdosed to this point in nature, nothing even fucking close to a band concert with a shit ton of people.  So I saw some pretty trippy shit.  I was having a pretty not fun trip and then I started to hear like a conversation over the mumble of the crowd and band.  It didn‚Äôt sound real and only lasted when I was very very anxious it was also intelligible.  It discontinued as soon as I left the venue and went outside.  Then the rest of my trip was fine at my buddies apartment(I was still high as fuck).  

So then a couple months later I had taken a T break from edibles or smoking so I unfortunately took an 100 mg edible (first time getting high alone in my apartment). I started to play some Doom Eternal with my headphones on and decided to drink a fucking monster.  Then my tinnitus got so bad.  Finally I ripped my headphones off because I heard my neighbors and made me incredibly anxious because I heard my neighbors throwing a party but the high made it sound like it was in my apartment and I hadn‚Äôt heard them all year.  Then I took my headphones off a couple hours later to go to bed and it sounded like I heard the noise of a conversation in white noise again.  This made me freak the fuck out and I slept it off.  

Is this shit normal? It only happens when I am anxious as fuck when I am high.  I haven‚Äôt gotten high since and it has been 3 months no issues.  I didn‚Äôt have any delusions or anything it was really weird tho.

Should I be concerned about psychosis???

I can't go to the dentist, to the pool, to the cinema - because I immediately get diarrhea from anxiety. Is there anyone here who has struggled with this and can write about what helped them?"

938,Anxiety & depression trigger - my partner cleaning ,"Hello all. 

I‚Äôm just hoping for some other viewpoints and/or advice. I feel vulnerable about posting this but thought it‚Äôs worth a shot. 

Quick background: I have OCD, anxiety, ADHD, CPTSD. Perfectionist tendencies. People pleaser tendencies that have improved a lot over the years but still struggle with. 
I‚Äôm primarily a SAHM and work freelance remotely. Some still undiagnosed chronic health issues including fatigue that I‚Äôm trying to work through. 

Ok so‚Äî 
Most times that my partner cleans ((while I have chosen to relax or do something not ‚Äúproductive‚Äù)), I end up hating myself. 

I berate myself for being useless and never working hard enough. It triggers me to the point that I can no longer relax or enjoy anything that I am doing, sometimes for the entirety of the day. Sometimes it causes me to spiral in a Depressive thought cycle and feel worthless. 

I often join with him in cleaning or organizing when he does; often out of my own guilt and also my sense of obligation as a partner (I don‚Äôt want all the burden on him). But in the times that I feel too burned out or exhausted (like today), I just try to ‚Äúrelax‚Äù. 

I believe there are multiple reasons why this bothers me so much: 
I struggle with self-worth; 
I would rather him just spend time/hang out with me than clean (kind of selfish I guess haha)
I have thoughts that I should be the one doing most of the cleaning since I am a SAHM‚Ä¶need to ‚Äòearn my keep ‚Äò ha 
I have anxiety about wasting time / dying & imminent doom (haha sounds silly to write the last part out) 

I have so much guilt about everything. It ruins my day when he cleans for a couple hours, and if there are other things planned that day, then we don‚Äôt spend any quality time together. And then I feel guilty for my poor mood becuase it affects him‚Ä¶

I guess I‚Äôm just hoping for advice as a way to move forward? 

I know that he is cleaning to be helpful and because he loves us. He shows love mostly through acts of service. 

But I can‚Äôt help but think that I‚Äôm just weighing him down, because I cannot clean the house to a level that is acceptable to him. It makes me feel like a child when helps so much. 
I often tell him ‚Äúno, don‚Äôt do the dishes I will do it‚Äù etc , but he usually does them anyway. Sometimes I take too long to do a task instead of doing it immediately, so that‚Äôs on me. I try my best üò¨ 
When he cleans anyway, he does it to be supportive, but it makes me feel that he doesn‚Äôt trust me any more to do what I say I will do (at least in regard to cleaning) or that me asking him not to do it doesn‚Äôt matter. 

Important to note- my partner comes from a home with very strict rules & cleaning/chores,abuse. he even played man of the house as a teen. He is also neurodivergent .  

Maybe this is a stupid thing to vent about. Maybe the house would be filthy if he didn‚Äôt do as much as he does. Idk. I should just ‚Äòbe grateful‚Äô ü•∂

Going to post this anyway. Haha. 
Thank you for reading this long as message if you have‚Ä¶ 

TLDR: how can I move past feelings of worthlessness when my partner cleans instead of me? "
939,Tattoo question!,"Hello! I‚Äôm 18F and I just got my first Tatoo yesterday. It‚Äôs small and a simple phrase on my right forearm and didn‚Äôt take to long. I really love it! And don‚Äôt regret it one bit but I just have a question of how long is it supposed to be pitch black?. 

I don‚Äôt wanna post a picture just in case my artist sees it as I live in a small community. 

He was very nice and very gentle with the pressure as I was very nervous about the pain. 

But I‚Äôm just curious to know how long it‚Äôs gonna be pitch black for? "
940,Some days just feel off and I don't know why,"Ive had really bad anxiety for a long time now, and i always get this feeling that i hate. It's like when you had a crush in school, and would get butterflies when you talk to them, execpt it doesn't feel good like they did. I just have these days where I feel like something is wrong but I don't know why. I know there are things I'm thinking about that are making me anxious, like driving lessons or something, but it isn't those things that has me feeling that way. It's hard to describe, it's just like this little nagging feeling of despair or panic in my gut and I don't know why it's there. 

It's probably common among people with anxiety, but can any of you relate? And maybe some of you might know what this is or what causes it? Or maybe it's just another symptom of anxiety."
941,Boyfriend of 12 years is having anxiety about our relationship. Need help,"My boyfriend and I have been together for 22 years. (Both of us are 28.) He confessed that he‚Äôs been having a lot of anxiety that he doesn‚Äôt want about the relationship, stemming from the thought that what if he can‚Äôt promise that we will be together in the foreseeable future, (5-10 more years.) He‚Äôs having thoughts like he‚Äôs leading me on, can‚Äôt give me what I need, etc. He said he knows he loves me and wants to be with me, and wants to try making the anxiety go away. I‚Äôm just really struggling with this. I know he loves me, but it‚Äôs still painful to hear. I get what he‚Äôs going through because I suffer from OCD that attacks our relationship, but the thought of losing him is devastating. I‚Äôve been sick to my stomach and ruminating from anxiety. I want to believe he‚Äôs telling the truth, but I have this horrible feeling he‚Äôs going to break up with me, and the anxiety will win. I want to trust that he means what he says, and he does love me and wants to be with me, and it‚Äôs the anxiety attacking the relationship that has him upset. How can I manage this? What do I do? I‚Äôm really struggling. How do I manage this? I‚Äôm really struggling."

943,There is hope everyone,"I switched to Abilify a few months ago and it has changed my life in so many ways for the better. My anxiety which used to be astronomical has been greatly reduced. And I‚Äôd like to share a milestone.

Yesterday night I had a party with friends.

Before I would‚Äôve been having the runs, anxiety attacks, trying to think of a way to get out of it, etc. before the party. At it I wouldn‚Äôt engage nearly enough, I‚Äôd question every single word, I‚Äôd get overloaded and retreat, etc. Remember this is all with **friends**.

However, none of this happened last night. I was my true self. I laughed and talked. I was engaged the whole night. I came home in tears, happy tears, and I‚Äôm tearing up right now. And prior to the party my only nerves were my teeth which need work and my hair which is prone to dandruff. But that was healthy nerves as I just made sure to wash twice and thoroughly and really pay attention with the toothbrush.

Like I said in the title there is hope. If you are a person who believes in medication. Talk to your doctor. I know it can be scary. I was terrified myself when I told him things weren‚Äôt working. But he took it in stride. He wasn‚Äôt angry. He wasn‚Äôt annoyed. He just said ok let‚Äôs try this. "
944,Anxiety and paranoia even a day after a bad high from weed,"I don‚Äôt understand why I do this to myself. I used to smoke when I was younger and had a blast with it but I had one bad high that set my anxiety off so bad that I still today battle with general anxiety and depersonalization at times.  Since then I‚Äôve tried smoke a few times over the last 10 years and every damn time I have a bad reaction but convince myself that the next times will be different because ‚Äúit was just the type of weed, you had to much caffeine before hand, you were drunk, etc) Everything starts out fine and I feel the effects but it‚Äôs when I sit down and stop moving that I begin to have severe short term memory which causes me to feel like I‚Äôm not in control of my body causing anxiety causing paranoia. Anyway, I tried again last night and it was the same damn thing. I had a panic attack on and off for 3hrs. Today I still feel very on edge. Anxious and a bit paranoid. Nothing compared to how I felt last night but the past times that this has happened I felt fine the following day. But not today. I know I‚Äôm going to feel okay in 3-5 days but I guess I‚Äôm just looking for some reassurance from others that have had bad experiences with weed?

Also, no it was not laced. Weed is legal in MD and this was from a pen from a dispensary "
945,Travel Anxiety Help,"I (27F) have an upcoming vacation next week with my mom. I‚Äôm excited for this trip and have been looking forward to it. Recently I‚Äôve started feeling more and more anxious as the departure date approaches. Anxiety for me often presents itself as nausea, lack of appetite, inability to sleep and sometimes vomiting with the inability to get out of my own head. This isn‚Äôt a new thing for me, in the past I‚Äôve gotten anxious on vacations- even places I‚Äôve been before.

I don‚Äôt feel very in control of this reaction. I don‚Äôt understand why this happens- I don‚Äôt have a fear of flying or fear of airplanes. I think a lot of it stems from being nervous about existing in a space outside of my normal routine/away from home. My brain is truly looking forward to this vacation and I‚Äôd hate for my mom to have a bad time because I can‚Äôt cope. I‚Äôd really like to be able to travel in my life and enjoy my time without excessive worrying and without feeling physically ill. Any helpful advice is appreciated."
946,Moving to a no name town.,"Have any of you ever had the dream to move to a no-name town and lose yourself? 

Most of my life, I've been living in a city (Boston). A couple of months ago, I was visiting some family in Spain. While traveling around, we pass by a couple of small towns in the middle of nowhere. Those towns feel so chill and quite to the point that I start to have fantasies about moving to a random small town, deleting all social media, and completely losing myself. Almost as if staring a new life."
947,Buspar invoked Panic Disorder,"tl;dr: I started Buspar and developed a panic disorder while on vacation in Ireland. 

In October 2022 I started taking Buspar for GAD. Prior to starting I had only moderate anxiety attacks. In November 2022 while on a trip to Dublin Ireland I found myself needing to use the restroom (#2). Being in the middle of downtown Dublin I couldn‚Äôt find a restroom and started to panic fearing I would have an accident. Fortunately I did find a pub and was able to mitigate the issue. A few days later my wife and I were on a tour bus from Dublin to Kilkenny. I boarded the bus and started to panic about the possibility of needing a bathroom on the 1.5 hour ride. I freaked out and got off the bus leaving my wife and headed to a coffee shop to find a bathroom. The bus almost left me but I got on and sat through a panic attack for the entire ride. I again did not have an accident. 

Over a year later I‚Äôve finally worked through my fear of driving or being away from restrooms thanks to 100 mg of Zoloft and CBT therapy. Has anyone else had a panic disorder form due to Buspar? "

Long story short I had a bad experience with extremely small dosage of Zoloft.

951,College grad - job anxiety ,"For some background, when I was 15 I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder. I'm 25 now and just recently finished my BA. Earlier this month I had a golden job opportunity with tons of perks, bonuses and good benefits. I accepted the offer, but my excitement just turned into frozen icy fear and trembling. I couldn't eat or sleep for days leading up to my proposed first day of work, and the day I was supposed to start I just completely had a meltdown of anxiety, panic, fear, dread and I ended up not going to the job and emailed the hiring manager that I was no longer able to work for them. 

All sorts of super negative and extremely anxious thoughts have been invading my space and I thought maybe I just needed more time. So I took a 2 week break from applying to jobs, and then kind of felt a little better and applied again (within the last week). Recruiter got back to me amost immediately and offered me a job and I thought okay, I feel a little better maybe I can do this. I thought if I felt indifferent to the job it wouldn't freak me out as much. Nope, that horrible icy dread immediately started to seep in. I was supposed to start tomorrow but all last night I was up with intense anxiety and crying bouts and worry. I've been crying on and off all day and trembling and I told the recruiter I couldn't work for them because my mental health was too chaotic right now. 

I'm just completely overwhelmed and overrun with anxiety about every little thing. About my performance, abilities, appearance, anxiety about waking up in the morning, anxiety about driving to work and being on time/being late, anxiety about being at work for long periods, anxiety about socializing with others, anxiety about having to drive home, etc. I just absolutely cannot function. I don't know what to do.

 Words of encouragement and pep talks by my family, while well intended, literally do nothing for me. My uncle who is an LMFT thinks I'm just lazy and don't want to work. Partner is frustrated with me because I haven't been able to get over my fear of working yet. I don't have friends to talk to, and I'm trying to figure out seeing a therapist. Everything feels like impending doom. "

I want to go back to university so badly but when practicing for interviews my brain goes blank every time. Has anybody overcome this and how did you do it? I have received therapy and try to challenge anxious thoughts but it still feels very untameable.

961,What I find to be the most difficult part about having anxiety ,"The worst part about having anxiety is constantly having to ask yourself that if the thought you just had is based in logic or based in anxiety. And 70% of the time, you have no idea what the answer is. Worst of all is that if you guess it's just anxiety, dismiss it, and then turn out to be wrong, it is miserably painful and sets you back by months. This makes you always prefer to guess that it must be logical and real. That way if you're wrong, it's only a brief and relatively small amount of discomfort and pain. But of course, the worse your anxiety is, the more you're wrong, and the more that pain adds up anyway. It ends up feeling like an endless war that you can never truly win. A war whose sole purpose is to make you as miserable as possible.

right now i have this head pressure, it‚Äôs something like when you get up too fast and your head rushes and you feel a little faint or lightheaded, but it‚Äôs constant. No pain, just pressure. I first felt it on and off while walking around the park yesterday, like a head rush where I felt faint and needed to take a deep breath to correct it. happened maybe 10 times in the 2 hours I was there. by the end of the day the pressure was just there, it‚Äôs constant, it‚Äôs accompanied by very loud pulsatile tinnitus which has only recently in the past month been a recurring issue for me. I tried taking a hot shower to relax but it didn‚Äôt do much for me. I have it again this morning at work and it‚Äôs making me overthink what I should eat or drink since I‚Äôm not sure my recent ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù diet is causing some imbalance. I admit I‚Äôve been drinking a lotttt more water but also eating much less food. 
I don‚Äôt know, I‚Äôm feeling constantly on the edge of passing out and it‚Äôs so impossible to keep ignoring. I can‚Äôt tell if this is anxiety anymore. I have an appointment with my doctor tomorrow, but I‚Äôm positive my stress building up is gonna send me back to the ER for likely no reason."

It all started when I had a panic attack in November of last year and ever since then I haven‚Äôt felt the same and I still have similar symptoms.

What is bothering me most is my vision and fatigue, no matter how much rest I get I am always tired no matter what.

966,"My health anxiety is consuming me, advice needed!","(Trigger Warning: Relatively detailed description of heart related symptoms (Palpitations) and mentions of cardiac arrest)

Hello,  
  
So, i've been experiencing another bad health anxiety episode recently and my doctors appointment is still a little while away and i really need some advice, because it just can't go on like this.  
  
First, a little about my current episode: I'm 18f and have had quite severe health anxiety for around 2 years now. Recently, i've been experiencing pretty bad heart palpitations. They happen around once every 2 days or so, but every time they happen they are horrible. It feels as if my heart is cramping and being squeezed really hard. It doesn't hurt but renders me unable to breathe or move for a good 5 to 7 seconds. My heart rate always increases a lot and i feel a panicked fluttering in the chest for about 10 to 15 minutes afterwards. It's made even worse by the fact that, for as long as i can remember, i've always been able to feel my heart beat in my chest, so it feels even more severe when the palpitations happen.  
  
As far as i am aware, my blood pressure is normal, but my last test was 8 months ago, so i can't be sure. I'm convinced its agina (coronary artery disease) or heart disease, because i struggle with bad sensory issues with foods, so my diet is quite unhealthy. I just always panic that i'm currently dying and when i finally go to the doctor its too late and they tell me i only have months left to live. Or even that ill go into sudden cardiac arrest.   
It's absolutely consuming me and i really, really hate it. It's undeniably intercepting with my day to day life, because i even have to leave class sometimes, due to the fact that i feel like i am dying and don't want to traumatise others with my sudden death. I'm driving my parents and boyfriend insane with always being unreasonably anxious. And of course, i am ruining my mental health. I'm already depressed enough, i do not need this.  
If anyone knows how to effectively deal with episodes like these, please tell!  
I really just need some advice with how to deal with this, so thank you in advance, everyone!"

So finally I was like, let me Google these Benzos in general, only to find that the fear that kept me clutching on to my just in case 0.5s was no where near the doses that have very bad withdrawal risks.   


It‚Äòs the fear mongering that kept me holding on to my 0.5s & it‚Äôs fear Mongering that I am not taking my ADHD meds cause I didn't wanna ever have to have the 2 mix in my system.

970,how to manage stress??,I have been super anxious recently and have been kind of catastrophizing about everything. How do I calm myself down and figure out the root of the problems? I can‚Äôt tell anymore if my concerns are valid or just a product of my anxiety.
971,Why can't I just move on?,"Last year I was in a car accident where someone hit me from behind at full speed while I was stopped. Thankfully I was in a family suv that took the brunt of impact; had I been driving my car, it probably would have been worse. Now I seem to be magnet for people who are not paying attention and end up rear ending you (3rd time), but this was different; I think maybe because I was already dealing with other stressful things. But after this, it was one bad thing after another in relation to the accident. Back pain, insurance dragging their feet every step of the way, expectation that I could take care of everything, long wait for repairs due to backorder for parts, and anxiety when a driver was way too close behind me while driving. 

All of this just got to a point I was suffering from severe symptoms. Chest pains, heart palpitations, trouble breathing, panic attacks...you name it, I suffered it. Any mention of the accident or the long repairs would put me into another panic state, I just couldn't cope anymore. I thought I was finally done with it 5 months later after getting our car back. Nope, now another situation has come up in relation to the accident and here I am, full blown chest pains and trouble breathing all weekend long, trying very hard to keep my mind occupied on others things and failing miserably. Sometimes I can distract myself, other times it just creeps back in. And its so frustrating. I want to move on. I don't want to think of the accident anymore and feel all those emotions and stress. 

I just can't anymore. I don't want to go through this every time something stressful happens. I tried therapy, it didn't work. How many times can I also talk to loved ones without them feeling burdened as well? It feels like such a lonely journey even though I know there are others going down the same path. "
972,what to do if you dont really want to have a sleepover?,"hi, i‚Äôm a 18 year old who‚Äôs had, what i think is, anxiety, since i was young. i‚Äôm usually nervous about a lot of things like i‚Äôve always stressed about everything that‚Äôs not in my normal routine. 

for example, i had really bad motion sickness since i was young (not that bad anymore) and i was always just super stressed about trips in general. i have puked many times because i‚Äôve felt so ill cause of the motion sickness. when i started to become older, i don‚Äôt know if nausea was caused by motion sickness but rather being just anxious of vomiting. 

i often react to having to face a new thing or going to a trip through my body. i usually become a bit nauseous, then i start to fear that i‚Äôll vomit and then it gets worse. when i was like 15? i vomited before my piercing appointment cause i was so nervous about it and the fact that i had to travel via bus (motion sickness is the worst in a bus, vomited before in a public bus too) but somehow pulled through the appointment? and i was completely fine afterwards.

so now to my current problem, which is that i‚Äôm supposed to have like a cocktail night tomorrow with my best friends and some of their friends. i don‚Äôt which is the worst, having to drink though i don‚Äôt really want to, being around people that i‚Äôm not that good friends with or the fact that we‚Äôre supposed to have a sleepover. i‚Äôm usually anxious before drinking and it gets worse couple drinks in. then it usually get better though. 

i don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs rude if i‚Äôm the only one not sleeping over cause i‚Äôm already anxious about the morning. on my birthday it was the first time i went over the top with drinking and i woke up feeling like absolute garbage, i ended up vomiting (and my cat died the same day btwüíÄ). since then i think i‚Äôve just feared that i‚Äôll throw up? the next time i drank, on new years i had bad hangxiety, i could barely eat since eating just made me more nauseous and i just cried when others were watching a movie. 

so yeah after these have happened, i‚Äôve just grown to hate the morning after drinking especially since i‚Äôm not at home. i fear that i‚Äôm not going to be able to eat in the morning after the sleepover. i talked about not staying over the night and just going home after with my best friends who was okay about it, but i still feel like it‚Äôs rude and the others will judge since i‚Äôm the only one.

so should i stay the night like the others or go home (i live like 5minutes away walking)?

i just feel like i‚Äôm the only one like this and friends can‚Äôt really relate. i‚Äôm also a introvert and i love my own time at night/morning. i‚Äôd love advice also on what to do to not be like thisüò≠ i‚Äôve debated for long whether this is serious enough to go to a therapist.

973,Anyone else struggle to keep a job?,"In the past 4 months I've had 11 different jobs. Most of which I either quit the day I started, or didn't show up at all. I just started a new job and I've made it through the first 2 days surprisingly, but the dread and urge to quit is starting to kick in, especially after having several panic attacks my second day and my coworkers laughing at me for being slow. In my entire life (I'm 31) the longest I ever held a job was for 4 months. 
Can anyone relate to this? 
Does anyone have advice?"
974,It wasnt caffeine sensitivity... It was the nocebo :),"
Hey guys. I hope this will help people. I used to be anxious person or lets ƒ± was going through hard times. Now I manage everything well. So When ƒ± drink caffee before , it would make me jittery or stressful. So ƒ± believed that maybe it was may genes. Because thing like caffeine sensitivity were exist . ƒ∞ didnt mind and I went on my life without coffee. But ƒ± been always heavy tea drinker :) And years after , I joined to mandatory army services for a while. I live in turkey BTW. ƒ∞n the army , Maybe because of new environment or something else, ƒ± became more self conscious and self aware. I was watching my behavioral patterns and relationship others, how ƒ±m acting bla bla. In some day, ƒ± drank tea and got anxious :) I thought , i used to drink tea every fckn morning in my home. Nothing happened so far. So what is this :) 2-3 day after ƒ± drank it again with intention and to see what is going on my body. After 5min i drank it , my heart was beating like drum, ƒ± was sweating . Kind of fight flight response. But ƒ± was conscious. after that ƒ± started to make research about it. And ƒ± found out 'nocebo' effect :) I ve read couple of legit researches. And finally ƒ± concluded that it was nocebo. After this time , ƒ± started to drink tea slowly. But with watching myself manner. I was watching my mind , 'what ƒ±m telling to myself, how ƒ±m making myself worry with my thoughts' and sorted it out. It was power of believing!! Some research showed that , They give the people sugar pill and they tell them they may feel little bit headache or nausea . guess what happens. Even with sugar pill(empty content) they felt what they ve been told :D

Today was first day that ƒ± drank some latte. And it was very good. Before even onesip coffee made me insane :D

My advices to everyone that in trouble with this subject;

Dont label yourself like 'Maybe my gene or maybe ƒ±m that sensitive'

Watch your mind before drinking that thing. Dont forget the power of mind!!

What you really believe , will happen!

Read some articles and research about 'NOCEBO'

I overcame this with these methods. Dont restrict yourself because of your anxiety.

Be brave. Dont b afraid of your emotions. They are there for some reason. You will not die because of you felt anxious :D Manage and regulate your emotions and feeling. Tryna understand what they are tryna tell you. Im not native english speaker. This was best ƒ± can do. :)"
975,Panic with no trigger and ear pressure,"I have a history of anxiety and panics attacks across the past 10 years. My panic attacks have never had a specific trigger, rather arise after I‚Äôve been in a state of stress and anxiety for a long period of time. I‚Äôve also had nocturnal panic attacks over the year. My attacks as a whole are pretty infrequent.

Yesterday, as I was walking into church, out of the absolute blue, I started experiencing what felt like a panic attack. The strange part was is that I was not stressed out this particular day. I had a good day with my wife and daughter at the zoo. I even took a work call only a few minutes earlier.

The first thing I felt was a heaviness in my legs, and then very strangely the pressure in my ears went completely off. My allergies have been bad so I‚Äôm not sure if this was coincidence but the fact that it happened at the same time was odd. The feeling of dread, like I should leave immediately came and as I became aware of what I was experiencing my heart rate started pounding. 

The ear pressure, heavy legs, and feeling of dread were gone in a couple minutes. But I experienced my normal anxiety symptoms after the fact for the next hour or so. 

Having healthy anxiety, I ran through aneurysm, stroke, heart problem. But now I‚Äôm convinced it could a tumor on my adrenal gland (I love health anxiety). Has anyone experienced anything like this?

Edit: For added context, I had barely eaten anything in the span of 24 hours. A banana hours earlier was about it.

Im scared that in the future even if I do get a rad tech degree I won‚Äôt be able to land a job and make good money; I‚Äôm always overthinking everything and knowing I‚Äôm doing that created another fear that I‚Äôm not living in the present and will look back in the future like ‚Äúman I wish I had appreciated that time more‚Äù but I can‚Äôt stop worrying and that makes me worry that I‚Äôll truly never be satisfied.

I took a ceramics class and had a lot of fun last semester so I‚Äôm taking another this semester for fun but all of a sudden my brain started over analyzing and thinking ‚Äúwhat if I‚Äôm just wasting time taking this class instead of focusing on moving forward with my career to get there as fast as possible‚Äù I want to be successful and help out my parents but it makes me so anxious to not get there fast enough because they‚Äôre kind of old (50ish) and I get scared of them dying or me not being able to be successful for them. I started setting goals for myself like finally learning how to drive or maybe signing up to volunteer at a hospital in my free time but then again I wonder if I‚Äôm making wrong choices in my life, that one small choice will butterfly into a sad future. I keep worrying about my older siblings and my parents and whether or not they‚Äôll be successful and happy in the future it always seems like everyone else has more than I do and I won‚Äôt be able to make it in the future or I look on social media and people I used to enjoy I always think ‚Äúsee they‚Äôre doing something with their life and being successful while you‚Äôre still stuck here‚Äù,,,I just want to be at peace and be grateful and happy and healthy and I want to be strong enough to endure failure and hardship but I don‚Äôt know how to get there mentally."

981,"after 3 years of zero anxiety, it‚Äôs really bad again and i can‚Äôt get help.

Anyone that has tried/is on venlafaxin can shine some light or share your experiences with the med?
984,Conscious ‚â† Crisis ?,"So, I can't find anything relating to my experience anywhere whatsoever, so here I am. To start this off, when I was about 13 I got interested in understanding the cognitive psychology/ thinking of others, as well as my own (mental processing, how people perceive, think, remember, learn, problem solve, decision make). I'm 18 now, and it's all still something very important to me. I've internalized and tried to deduce most things about life & myself, and I still do. But unfortunately, I think that journey is part of the reason why in my recent time, It feels like my brain has spiraled into something that I REALLY don't understand. My mental awareness is just so overwhelming at this point its caused me a lot of experiences that I could best describe as sensory overload. And I do not believe It's induced by any emotional state, as I usually feel completely fine but I guess 100% in tuning with my consciousness is just somehow a recipe for disaster at this point. I will do my best to explain further.  -For more context, I'm sure my desire to always have the answer to ""why"" I felt a certain way, or why a person did XYZ, came from my want for a better life as a kid- I had dealt with a number of traumatic experiences, which led me to be develop with Borderline Personality Disorder (diagnosed). At the time I was very disliked, and constantly causing issues with others, I felt awful with myself 24/7. And at some point I realized that my own behaviour is what kept knocking others down as well as myself, I just hated it. 
So after that I just instinctively went about things with a wiser mind while paying attention to mentality & environment more. I wanted stability, and I wanted that for everyone I knew as well, so I stuck to the path of reframing. Fast forward to now and my psychiatrist stated that I barely meet the criteria for BPD, and I'm genuinely happy with myself, as I'm always looking to be a better person than I was yesterday. I try to help others as much as I can, whilst utilizing what I've learned and I'm so glad that I've been able to do so. Don't get me wrong, it's a wonderful thing, I just partially believe it's what made my mind spiral into what it is now. I've pretty much mentally-dissected everything I've felt and socially experienced as a human being, if that makes any sense. But, the actual issue I face is the entirety of it all, it's the fact I now feel as if my ability to be completely aware of anything and everything I experience is just too much to the point I feel like I've ripped into a part of my mind that I should've never gotten into. My brain genuinely feels like a circus that's just completely demented. Even if I feel fine, I act exactly the same, yet all the pieces in my head feel functional, but out of place?
And as if theres just some unexplainable void creeping in, and it's existentially-unnerving.. that's my best descriptor for it sorry. 
So of course my instincts have been to understand ""that"" . 
But attempting to do so has only filled me with a severe sense of impending doom, inducing actual physical symptoms. I get hit with cold flashes, severe nausea, gagging, extreme chest pain and tension headaches, and it'll either be just that or followed by a hell-on-earth panic attack. In those I completely lose connection with myself, and any grasp of my entire life & where I am, It literally feels like pure insanity and I fear those episodes immensely. Ive found ways to put a temporary pause on my brain with mindfulness tricks I think? But of course, not a fix. I kinda feel like the only person whose brain is trying to destroy itself in such an obscure and unconceivable way, and for no reason. Okay so what I want to know here is if anyone at all, like anybody, has some insight, or relates at all. ? Anyone else have an unsettling amount of mental awareness to the point your mere conscious scares you? I'd really appreciate anything anyone has to say and thank youu :("
985,Biweekly/monthly mood swings,"Biweekly/monthly mood swings

Hello all,

I have a question that perhaps someone here can relate during their experiences on Zoloft.

My depression and GAD were diagnosed ~4years ago. I started Zoloft 50mg, and took it for 2 years without knowing for real if it was ""working"" or not.

After 2 years, I increased my dosage for 100mg, and after +-1 month, I noticed that for the first time I could notice the difference of an antidepressant ""working"". I felt at ease, motivated, just rational, everything was so good, I was feeling immensely grateful for that feeling. However, my anxiety was always wanting to creep up on me, and I feared that that great feeling would go away. And yes, as it came, it went away in 1 week, and then I had a depression dip, and you guys know what depression looks like...I had those high peaks for some other times, and they would come +- from 2 to 2 weeks, and sometimes once a month. But after each high, there would be a huge low. That is so frustrating. 

I increased my dosage to 150mg, and after +-1 month, I had another peak. But this time it was a bit different. I felt amazing, but that fear of losing it was not with me. The anxiety was not with me. Sadly, that amazing feeling went away in 1 week again, and now I find myself in a depressed mood. 

Those mood swings are so exhausting. I feel great and terrible. I just want to be myself, which is I'm sure that is more like when I get those highs. I'm also on therapy, don't use drugs and alcohol.

Does anybody have or have had a similar experience?

987,Update: Decided to Push Through Agoraphobia,"My last post received an overwhelming amount of love and support and I thank everyone of you for the encouraging words at my lowest in a long time. I thought I‚Äôd update you all who are interested.

To preface the following, here‚Äôs my story condensed to a few sentences. COVID-19 and years of abusing substances resulted in a pretty gnarly anxiety disorder. Agoraphobia to be exact. There's no one to blame but me for that outcome. I went on and off medications, got sober and clean, took care of myself aesthetically (something I ignored for years), and bettered myself via study. Regardless, I continue to suffer from chronic anxiety disorders surrounding stomach problems and agoraphobia. 

I decided to last minute join a trip to Disney World, 1,000 Miles away from Boston (my home). For any agoraphobic person here, you all know how insane this trip was. Why and how I managed to even get here is beyond me. That said, as my last post suggests, I‚Äôve had a few episodes here that have made me feel quite sad. But I have realized something. 

Life doesn't end when you find yourself in a hole so dark you don't know where or how to climb out. It also doesn't get better through being silent about your struggle. We all will inevitably need help - no one can be both the dammed and the savior. All this is just to say thank you to the four who joined me on my first trip. Thank you to my wonderful girlfriend who spoke to me the days leading up to the flight out and continues to encourage me. Thank you to the Redditors who flocked to my aid. I had many anxiety induced struggles throughout this trip: I lashed out at people undeservingly, I ran away from things that seemed insurmountable, but overall I believe it was one well worth the effort.

Do not lose faith in man's ability to change because the ability to change is that which defines man - lose faith in that and you've lost faith in mankind.

My last leg of the trip, the flight back alone, is coming up in 9 hours ‚Äî wish me luck and thank you again. "
